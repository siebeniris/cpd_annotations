The doctors nutritionists exercise physiologists and therapists are the best of the best. I had a DEXA body composition scan and learned some things about myself I did not know. The dietician and exercise physiologist put it together to help me with nutrition and exercise goals and how to implement them gradually.

I was physically and emotionally exhausted. I knew I needed to reset my reset button. I had not been in the gym for 2 years due to life circumstances. Am I glad I decided to make a trip to Canyon Ranch. I appreciated the fact that you do not need to dress up for anything here. I never felt out of place not wearing makeup and dressing casually for dinner. I was more interested in taking it slow so did some stretching classes and low impact aerobic offerings water exercise classes and others that were of interest to me such as exercise for the feet beginning Pilates landscape tour massages and facial. I took the opportunity to have metabolic testing. The evening classes were excellent and a nice way to end a very busy day. Were the grounds and my room the very best I have ever experienced. No. but it is not about luxury here. I thought the statuary depicting Native American legends near the pools and ponds all by the same landscape designer team that did the new meditation garden too childish and not sophisticated for this type of facility but I am a serious gardener that prefers more naturalistic designs. This team seems to have tried to cram in as much as possible into the aforementioned meditation garden. The result is chaotic. My room was pleasant and functional. Did it have an HDTV. No. but I did like the fact that there were DVD and tape players in the room and a nice library of selections to choose from. Traveling on my own was no problem. I ate dinner with other solo travelers at the nightly Captains Table a few times and found I ran into many of the same individuals in classes whom I established albeit short friendships with. I made good use of the laundry facility near my room which makes it very easy to pack simply. Really come here for the classes and if you want to explore your spiritual side or to challenge yourself physically. It is imperative that you look through their offerings thoroughly and prepare your schedule with a program advisor before your arrival. You can always add or subtract but there is so much to do each day you will waste too much of your time attending to your schedule if you do not have some sort of an initial framework. If you only want to relax in luxury in the AZ sun your money would be better spent elsewhere.", "offset": [1334, 1455], "date": "2015-05-16", "cpt": "0", "category": "restaurant"}, {"id": 2, "uid": "59c987b8-7046-4041-84dc-b50635ceebf9", "sentence": "Desert Casual Indulgence. Canyon Ranch Tucson is a wonderful desert gem that will please those folks looking for a destination spa and wellness experience without all the shiny marble and frump. This resort has been pleasing the spa crowd for years and repeaters enthusiastically partake of the many diversions offered. As a spa newbie I was pleased that I did not have to feel obligated to do every class or any class for that matter and I could just relax if that was my intent. Comfortable rooms were well equipped with bath and another separate vanity area two spacious walk in closets and comfortable seating area along with patio. Calming pathways landscaped with succulents and desert plants led to the various one story wings of rooms. A few swimming pools were scattered about and none were crowded despite the 108 degree outdoor summer temperatures in Tucson. A daily offering of fitness classes for all levels lifestyle classes and talks indoor and outdoor activities as well as full spa and treatments keep folks busy. there is not a lack of things to do that is for certain. Staffers are very helpful and cheerful although during my stay I did notice some inconsistencies in dining room service. This may have been due to newly trained staffers coming on board that were not fully in the swing of things yet and was understandable to a point during low season. All in all service was great with a couple of hiccups including the failure to perform requested turn down service for two of the three nights stayed. No harm no foul this was not a big deal. On to food my favorite part. The food is fantastic at Canyon Ranch and it is pretty much all healthful. Granted you can have more than one entr\u00e9e or dessert if you wish if you are not interested in counting calories. Salads galore are offered with lunch and dinner selections and they are all wonderful. I was in salad heaven with the fresh veggies varied greens and fun toppings. there is a custom omelet station at breakfast and custom pasta station for dinner and several entrees are offered daily with menu change ups. There are a la carte accoutrements to add to your entr\u00e9e including fresh breads and spreads a lovely cauliflower mash and other items. Desserts were appealing and there was always fresh fruit. The Double U Caf\u00e9 was the alternate dining venue and sandwiches and pizzas were fantastic. I did not miss a daily frozen chocolate covered banana for dessert at lunchtime. a special treatI experienced a Canyon Ranch 50 Minute Massage at the Spa which was great. My therapist Grace was personable and asked all the right questions and she did a fine job. I also partook of a Spa Pedicure at the Salon and my technician CJ was a real pro. Although my stay was a short three nights most folks would do well to stay a week or longer at the Ranch to partake of more treatments and relaxation as well as the activities. All in all my first time destination spa experience was two thumbs up at Canyon Ranch Tucson. I had come back and I had recommend it for folks looking for a more casual resort environment with great amenities.", "offset": [1870, 1946], "date": "2015-08-19", "cpt": "0", "category": "restaurant"}, {"id": 3, "uid": "128e015e-0bf3-4886-9d3f-4feef09dc411", "sentence": "Active Healthy Casual Off the Grid Vacation. Canyon RanchI opted for a last minute Canyon Ranch vacation after my more exotic travel plans fell through. I had heard some amazing things about the Tucson location and the lure of a vacation that encompassed exercise and spa treatments in equal measure was very appealing. Booking was easy as I got a very knowledgable booking agent on the phone Ryan who patiently and efficiently took me through various options and gave numerous suggestions to find the right package for my budget. And as a first time guest I took advantage of a 20 discount and there is a mandatory spa treatment allotment that is a part of the package fee. It forces you to be a bit indulgent during your stay in the best of ways. Overall I very much enjoyed my stay at Canyon Ranch and can understand why I met so many return guests. Having been integrated into the culture over the course of one week I would absolutely jump at the opportunity to visit again. The culture at Canyon Ranch is very friendly casual and friendly and I bonded immediately with a couple of other first time Canyon Ranch travelers my age who enhanced my visit significantly with their company. The wellness centers offer a plethora of services which is very convenient especially if you find it difficult to juggle these appointments into your regular busy schedule of work and family. it is easy to leave the world behind and focus on you here and for the most part guests adhere to the no cell phone rule with a religious vigor texting on silent is okay if you just can not let go of home 10The Good. Canyon Ranch offers extensive programming it is like a summer camp for adults outdoor sports hikes of various levels etc fitness classes varying from dance to yoga to cardio to strength training to water aerobics to bare classes to things you may have never thought of art classes intro to watercolor painting and drawing and lectures and less formal discussions on various topics ie on sleep vortexes and electromagnetic radiation eating healthy etc. and of course a full array of spa services from special massages to facials etc that you can book during your stay. The exercise classes were AMAZING and plentiful. I took advantage of so many of them that I did not spend more than probably two hours max relaxing at the pool during my entire stay. I approached it with a theory of that I was going to try one or two things each day that took me out of my comfort zone. the variety made it easy. Every class is rated with a level so you can choose classes at a level that suits you. I took two bare classes each taught by a different instructor and they varied wildly from each other so the variation made it interesting and challenging. Each class is taught by an instructor and had one or two helpers. If you enjoy working out as I do but do not have enough time at home or if you just enjoy an active vacation Canyon Ranch is ideal. My World Dance class had real drums and percussionists. My DJ Dance Party class had a real DJ. Both were extraordinarily fun. The environment encourages you to try new things machines and exercises that you can incorporate into your daily routine. These exercise classes were hands down my favorite part of Canyon Ranch. And the participants ranged in age from their early 20s to their 70s. The personalities and ages of the instructors varied wildly. I took a Level II hike and other than the rain which made the rocks slippery I did not find it that difficult. Canyon Ranch provided a comfortable backpack with snacks a rain poncho and a van that drove us to the trail. I wish that I had brought proper hiking boots so that I could have taken a Level III or IV. Wear lightweight pants on the trail to prevent scratches to your legsSign up for hikes and biking up to a week before on the boards outside the Outdoor area which is in the Spa building. Dress Casual casual casual. I overpacked. I did not need anything particularly nice on this trip. There was no fancy dining room and no one to impress. Most guests lived in work out wear by day and wore very comfortable casual clothing in the evening andor for meals and lectures. Leave your fancy clothes that require dry cleaning and heels at home. There is no need for makeup either. If you are going to bring a few extra items tote instead hiking boots an extra pair of sneakers extra socks extra workout wear and maybe an extra swimsuit. That said do it yourself laundry facilities are plentiful and free on property if you do not mind spending the time doing it on your vacation. Laundry soap and fabric softener sheets are provided the machines are new and state of the art and like all publicly shared areas of Canyon Ranch are meticulously clean. Convenience Something that Canyon Ranch does very well at is providing is convenience. There are tampons in every bathroom. You can ask for a quick snack at the reception or dining hall host stand or at the cafe do try the Pumpkin Spice spiced pumpkin seeds with dried cranberries it is delicious. Water bottles with your name on them and a Canyon Ranch tote are provided at reception and there are stations on the property near the dining room and in the Spa building where they can be filled with ice and filtered water or with a variety of iced teas or other healthy beverages. All guests are assigned lockers in the spa and are given robes and plastic slippers for the duration of their stay. I showered more at the spa than in my room while at Canyon Ranch it was so CONVENIENT. Lotion sunscreen shampoo body wash conditioner combs razors and all sorts of other toiletries are available for use by guests. Spa Services The Spa and health services provided at Canyon Ranch are plentiful so plentiful in fact that I found it a bit overwhelming to select my spa schedule. I opted for two deep tissue massages a special therapeutic medical neuro massage for a problem hip bulging disc and migraine headaches and a fancy facial. I was satisfied with all my services and they were performed as expected. Be sure to ask in advance the LOCATION of each service one of my massages was offered in the Life Enhancement building a 5 7 minute walk from the spa. There is an 8hour cancellation policy on all spa services so you do not want to be late or miss your appointment timeLectures. The lectures that unattended were interesting informative and most were taught by PhD Masters degree holders. I especially enjoyed the lectures on handwriting analysis taught by someone who is a forensic handwriting analyst and the lecture on sleep taught by one of Canyon Ranchs medical doctors. I also took a lecture on the vortexes at Canyon Ranch which was a bit out there but was interesting nonetheless another on healthy skin and another on suggestions of how to keep your work out routine while on the road. Sleep Screening I took advantage of an in room sleep screening while at Canyon Ranch. It was an additional 1000 for the apparatus that I had to wear at night and the consultation following. But I feel tired. all of the time and can fall asleep anywhere so I figured it was worth trying it as a lot of doctors do not generally study SLEEP. I learned some interesting things about my sleep patterns and myself and the doctor at the clinic said he would send a detailed follow up letter with his recommendations to me that I could share with my doctor at home. You can also do follow up tests while at Canyon Ranch they have all the facilities but I opted to try to find like services covered by my health insurance at home even if less convenient. If I had an unlimited budget I would love to do a whole health screening at Canyon Ranch. They focus on overall wellness so I felt that one could really get a lot out of it with an open pocketbook. FodThere is a dining hall for which you need a reservation at night but not for lunch or breakfast and a more casual cafe on site that stays open all day. Food was healthy and was served in proper portions with all the calorie and sodium information etc listed. I have a soy allergy and almost all meals served by Canyon Ranch had soy in them which was disappointing because the entrees often looked great and inviting otherwise. I was often stuck with the a la carte menu and would often ask for sides of vegetables. Ie A la carte salmon with a side of avocado and tomatoes with olives. The staff for the most part were very friendly and accommodating in spite of my challenges with the set menu some more than others and one day miraculously managed to materialize a bowl of marinara sauce to dress up my salmon which I very much appreciated. The marinara sauce at Canyon Ranch is very good. Canyon Ranch also appears to have a fetish with onions I can only guess that they find them somehow a salt substitute. Personally I loathe onions. But they were usually too plentiful to pick out and seemed a main ingredient in just about everything. The last thing you want to taste as you run from class to class working out is the residual from so many onions. Yuck. Even when I asked them to not use the scallion onion garnish my already heavily onioned soups arrived with the extra scallions. Call me perplexed. The food seems to cater to the Canyon Ranch audience. Nothing was bad but nothing wowed me either everything was okay to good disclaimer. I am a very difficult food critic. I would not cite the food as gourmet. It was like really good food your friends mom might make but with less salt and less fat. Most entrees were cooked with very little to no salt so while I never usually salt my food I strangely found that I was constantly asking for a salt shaker. Some items had a lot of cheese a slight contradiction for the healthy eater I note this to accentuate the variety. Also because the portions were very reasonable for someone focused on health and watching their diet it also gave me an opportunity to ask for a second item without guilt at times when I was really hungry four hard core exercise classes in a row can do that to a person. Do try the apple butter for breakfast on their homemade wholewheat toast. It was so good I had this for dessert one evening. In spite of an overall amazing experience at Canyon Ranch there are a few things they could have done better. Onboarding New GuestsWhen I was initially dropped at Canyon Ranch by the driver I found it so overwhelming. Check in seemed chaotic even though I arrived only with a couple of other people. The facility and the services were all really overwhelming. Perhaps staff gets a little lazy because there are so many returning guests. But it would have been SO NICE had someone met me at the van welcomed me had taken me to reception had my packet ready have given me a map and a brief overview of the property and had been able to help me with booking services. After they finally found my tote and water bottle I had to ask for a map. My room was not ready when I arrived so I had three hours to kill after a long flight. I wish they would have for example suggested that I catch lunch in the dining room before it closed as I waited. For the cost of the experience I really would have expected a bit of a better introduction to the property and a warmer welcome. Canyon Ranch seems to offer so many little things that they do not overtly mention. I wish I had know for example that you can ask for pre made snacks between meals at reception dining and at the cafe espresso drinks are offered only at the cafe mocktails are offered every evening outside the dining room. These are all little things that it would have been nice to know or that someone could have pointed out to a first time guest. You also had to sign up for services and hikes. etc all over the place. I expected that someone would sit with me to review my options for the week up front. But it was really left to guests to be 100 proactive and to seek the services out. When I did schedule a visit the client services area to schedule my spa visits I found the agent relatively unhelpful. When I asked about the complimentary nurse visit I had been told about over the phone I had filled out a long questionnaire before my arrival. I was told that I would have to go to Medical Services to schedule it. Everything seemed to work as a separate entity which seemed counter to Canyon Ranch being a wellness center. RomMy room was adequate if not as fancy as I would have anticipated. However it smelled musty like the entire space could have been given a well executed steam cleaning carpets curtains etc. With a dust allergy I spent my days happy and my nights entirely congested. This surprised me because the property itself was CLEAN everywhere the floors the sidewalks the pools the spa the bathrooms the dining areas the classrooms the work out spaces the machines etc. FodI touched upon this already but more soy free entrees or substitutions would have been much appreciated as would have been fewer entrees with so many onions. Try the chocolate covered bananas at the cafe. The marinara sauce was very good on top the side of salmon. Ask for extra vegetablesInconsistent StafThere was a big gap between life long staffers and the younger staff. Some staff were surprisingly dismissive andor unhelpful and yet others would go out of their way to help you. For this price my expectation was that they would do a better job at onboarding new employees into the Canyon Ranch culture. Health SurveyBecause I was a last minute booking I filled out the health survey that Canyon Ranch sends each guest in advance with some difficulty on my smart phone before I arrived while sitting in the airport. I was told it would be sent the evening before I left but it did not appear in my inbox until the next day when I was on my layover on my way to Canyon Ranch. However in spite of my efforts it was never referenced when I arrived. Even when I did the sleep study and visited medical services. I was told that I would have a complimentary visit with the nurse. Never happened. No one called. No one emailed. No one mentioned it again. And I was quite detailed and thoughtful as I filled it out. It was a waste of my time. Medical ServicesI was told in advance that I would receive an itemized bill for the sleep study and the consultation. However I was ushered out the door quickly after my appointment and when I asked for the itemized bill after my appointment I was told it would be mailed to me. If it was a matter of payment I would have gladly been billed immediately or they could have provided this in a confidential envelope at my check out. Jury is out on how long this will take to arrive and I am just hoping it will not require several follow up calls which I do not have time for. I would have appreciated to submit it immediately to my insurance company upon my return. WOULD I VISIT AGAIN. YESOveral I would definitely stay again and would recommend a visit if you are the type of person who enjoys an active and healthy on a vacation. It feels amazing. This facility has NO ALCOHOL. I was so busy the entire week and I did not miss it. But it may not be for everyone.", "offset": [10113, 10163], "date": "2015-09-27", "cpt": "0", "category": "restaurant"}, {"id": 4, "uid": "7a802610-fda0-47d8-a211-0d87f63c8b3a", "sentence": "Opportunity of a Lifetime to Improve Health and Happiness in a Beautiful Setting. My husband and I chose Canyon Ranchs Life Enhancement Program in Tucson for its reputation location and the opportunity to improve our health status.

It was located within easy access to the Health Wellness Center and the Life Enhancement Center. The grounds are lovely and provide access to so many different activities it is impossible to take advantage of even a fraction of what is available in one visit.

I can not even to begin to scratch the surface of expressing my gratitude for the week we experienced at Canyon Ranch Tucson. We were blessed to be placed in our casita by the exceptional Reservations Department more specifically Justin Riordan. From the moment of our arrival at the airport until our departure we were treated with the utmost respect from the genuine staff members in all departments of Canyon Ranch. We took part in the Life Enhancement Program from May 15 through May 21st 2016. The casitas were breathtaking from the moment we walked it very clean with no detail left behind. We were also impressed with the available amenities offered beyond what is normally available. The dining options were perfect and varied from the dining room versus the Double U Cafe. An additional and entertaining option is the Lunch and Learns. We definitely recommend taking part in those. The week started with an orientation and inspiring chat with Mel Zuckerman the Founder of Canyon Ranch. What a way to begin. The fitness classes were top notch of course from the old school aerobics to the up to date high intensity workouts. The fitness facility is also up to date with a variety of cardio equipment and up to date weightlifting options. The variety of strength tools present is also very commendable resistance bands slam balls Ketlebels Movestrong etc. We loved the variety of instructors coming from various backgrounds and fortes as well. Megan who instructed DJ Dance Party was fabulous. She was motivating the combo was not too challenging or too basic and we had a blast. Mira taught all of the mind and body classes we attended. She is very knowledgable and we appreciated what she shared without overwhelming us. We also had a few services as part of the LEP. I want to give my commending words to Andres Valasquez the Registered Dietitian. He literally changed my life and this was my Ah ha. He expressed such care and concern for me when he just met me. I became emotional in the service and he was right there with me. The medical staff available on property was professional and spent more time with us than any other medical professional I have ever seen in my life. The Exercise Physiologist Steve Gratkins was exceptional as well. I have so many goals in regards to working out that I did not have any expectations going in to the appointment. He narrowed down my goals we set a plan and focused in on what I currently need to prioritize. My mom lost her sunglasses for a few a days and Margie from Guest Services let my mom borrow her sunglasses for the duration of our stay. Who does that. Canyon Ranch. The staff even offered to drive to a nearby Walgrens and pick my mom up another pair of sunglasses and any additional items we needed. Turns out everything was available at the ranch. You all have covered everything. EverythingJim Eastburn and all of the LEC staff were so welcoming encouraging and bright lights to run in to on property. Such generous individuals and always willing to assist in any way. Canyon Ranch is another world that must be experienced.

My husband and I visited in December our third time to be at Canyon Ranch and our first since the original owners in their late 80s sold it earlier in 2017. There seems to have been a lot of turnover in upper management and some turnover in staff who interact with guests with lots of talk about more long time and beloved staffers preparing to leave in 2018. We LOVED the original Canyon Ranch and several things concern me about its current direction. One of the first things the new owners did for instance was completely remodel and restock the ranch store with CR branded expensive merchandise now it looks like a high end boutique from LA. Why. Were guests actually asking for this. Or did someone in management think this would be a way to coax even more money from guests. I spent about 5 minutes there no other guest was in the store and whoever was supposed to be supervising the area was chatting away with a friend in a back room. On a much bigger scale I question the wisdom of top management who thought it was a good idea to open a CR in Turkey. This venture did not even last a year it is been sold but who thought it was a good idea in the first place. Why not concentrate on what you do best which is to provide a unique place to nurture mind body and spirit. How much money time and energy was lost in this. Note the Turkey venture began while the original owners were still involved in CR but it was done under a new ish CEO who remains in place. What do moves like this suggest about where CR is headingI am concerned that some of our favorite staffers and activities had gone particularly in creative arts. I was told that the program is being redone and will be called creative expressions with a focus not on the product but on the process. Well that is all fine but did guests ask for that. I heard many return guests wonder what had happened to the necklace ladies who helped us craft lovely and useful jewelry. Others have brought up concerns about food and I think CR has gotten this message loud and clear. They were planning on changing the dining room fare to include more rotation on the menu. We were definitely underwhelmed with the main dining room. The Double U however was excellent though cold. wish they could figure out a way to keep that place warm when the winter temps drop to the 30s and 40s. Also we heard that rooms will be renovated. They are in need of it for sure although I spent so little time in my room that I do not consider a somewhat outdated room a big negative. But it is obviously something they need to address. Probably a lot of deferred maintenance around this property. However will it drive prices even higher. they are already at the very top for what we could hope to pay to go once a year or once every other year. Another small but telling item. The previous 2 years we received a survey after we returned home and within a few days of replying we got a mailed very specific reply from CR addressing ALL of our compliments and concerns. It was amazingly detailed and really showed me how much CR cared about its guests opinions. This year. I took the survey last month. Since then crickets. I doubt anyone is providing personal replies anymore. All this said this IS a fabulous property with so many things going for it. great variety of fitness classes and many excellent instructors. though what happened to the woman who taught belly dancing excellent spa aquatics program lovely property interesting metaphysical and spiritual offerings excellent nutrition advice etc etc. I will note that the price for all special services such as spa treatments or nutrition counseling went up significantly in 2017. it is way more than you had spend for this kind of service anywhere else.

I have been to ranch perhaps a dozen times but this was the first time since new ownership took over. I am fairly sure it was sold out the entire time I was there but as others have noted the way the facility is laid out it never feels crowded. With one exception below. The good is that the staff is still wonderful hiking biking and various nutritional and physical professionals all top notch and little things like transfers to from airport check in and check out run very efficiently and effectively. They have also extended the hours of the cafe making it easier to have lunch after a long hike or bike ride. The bad is that the menu choices at the main restaurant are more limited than they used to be with very little change in the menu from day to day. This is less important on a short stay but becomes very monotonous on a longer stay. When the ranch is sold out like it was the week I was there it also appeared the staffing at the main restaurant for dinner was slightly less than it needed to be and service was impacted. Overall food quality remains good. There were reports that new ownership considered changing the no alcohol served policy and decided to keep as is for most repeat guests changing that policy would fundamentally change what makes the ranch distinctive and I and others were gratified this possibility has gone away. New management seems to want to hear guest feedback as long as they listen to long time guests and be careful about too much change I suspect Canyon Ranch will remain in class of its own in this category.", "offset": [904, 1092], "date": "2018-03-04", "cpt": "1", "category": "restaurant"}, {"id": 14, "uid": "b4994469-89a7-457f-9495-436ce09cb78a", "sentence": "Like Disneyland for adults definitely want to come back.

I have just returned home from a 5 day stay at your beautiful Canyon Ranch resort in Tucson. As a first time guest the resort grounds meals services buildings etc is extremely overwhelming. Of course you are trying to make the most of every minute and unique offering but also not get lost. Nearly every interaction I experienced with your staff was positive professional and helpful. I must make mention to some staff members who went \u201c above and beyond \u201d in terms of helping us create such a fantastic life changing experience. From the beginning in terms of planning our trip \u2013 Kira in Program Advising answered our calls emails questions change of mind schedule reschedules and reassurance etc. for our resort services. Due to her very knowledgeable understanding of the extensive services offered \u2013 I was fortunate to reach beyond my comfort zone and try new experiences Acupuncture with Marta incredible and Biofeedback with John. Both challenged me to think and consider changes in life and without Kira \u2019s encouragement and guidance \u2013 I would stuck to the safer spa options. Talking of the spa \u2013 a young lady called Riley works the Spa changing rooms and service back room check in. I had daily interactions with Riley above and beyond helpful kind organized and efficient. There was nothing too much to ask and every question or request was greeted with a smile and \u201c you \u2019re so welcome \u201d. At times I would see Riley walking briskly between her back room check in duties and towel folding cleanup guest welcoming etc. Multitasking but always with a smile and what can I do for you. Without a doubt Meals at Canyon Ranch were a highlight of health and variety. Interesting delicious and beautifully presented. However probably the most significant stand out of our vacation was the quality and professionalism of your Restaurant staff. Angel Robalino the Grill Manager was beyond exceptional \u2013 his calm efficient and friendly demeanor no matter how busy how many check in guests meal alternations and special requests I would love to get to the 1 pm class \u2013 everything was handled with grace and competence. All of his staff were great. A few \u201c above and beyond \u201d names to mention. From our first dinner at the grill. \u2013 \u201c Aurora \u201d to our last breakfast at the W \u2013 without her encouragement we probably would never have explored the W caf\u00e9 or the variety of special offerings. Taylor Donna Paula and Evan \u2013 fabulous staff \u2013 knowledgeable friendly helpful with menu options \u2013 even when the dessert menu at the Grill was not offering that special blueberry tart with the delicious crust just a small sliver \u2013 it appeared on our bite platter. Donna was amazing when she explained we could do half portions of some lovely breakfast items share with our new table friends and enjoy the variety of the great foods offered. These may sound like simple \u201c. well that \u2019s their job \u201d descriptions but as a new comer to ranch \u2013 it is overwhelming just the sheer beauty and presence of everything that surrounds you there is just so much you just do n\u2019t know. And while being dazed at the exercise and wellness classes offered \u2013 and what should I do next. \u2013 sitting down to a delicious meal was our chance to regroup review what we had done and look forward to what to do next. A highlight of meal times was to strengthen new acquaintances share life journeys and enjoy the inspirations of such inspiring guests many of whom have been before \u2013 every year for many years. Each of the classes offered that I tried many I had never tried before were professionally run by obviously highly trained professionals \u2013 they were challenging but safe motivating and encouraging. Of course spa services Dorothea \u2019s Canyon Ranch massage were just blissful and a lovely way to spend some hours of relaxation and pampering. Initially we had thought that Canyon Ranch would be very special once in a life time experience. However given our special time here this past week we plan that Canyon Ranch will be a regular part of our future years. If I had to think of one thing other than the incredible surroundings that really bought together the whole experience from early in the morning until evening encourage new friendships life sharing and inspiration \u2013 it would be the team of incredible staff at the Grill and W caf\u00e9.

Breakfast and lunch we ate at the outdoor restaurant by the pool which was never crowded. Dinner we had made reservations before going to CR and had tlwait to be seated each night so moving up the reservation time may be a good move. Classes and the spa were excellent.

I have been concerned my last several visits about actions taken by new management particularly around the lack of variety day to day in food so went to Canyon Ranch last week with some trepidation. While I wish they would go back to the 5 7day rotation of new menus the overall visit was so exceptional that I can once again recommend to others without hesitation. A couple of things stood out on this visit. The outdoor sports hiking staff has always been a differentiator for Canyon Ranch and that remains the case and if anything is better than ever. Since I was the only guest most days who wanted to do a more advanced hike the staff was very flexible and allowed me to choose the specific hike for that day and their recommendations were spot on. One thing people do not realize is that while in July it can be 100 degrees at the Ranch the more advanced hikes take place at 60 90 feet where the temperature can be 20 degrees cooler so while it may take 45 minutes to drive to the trail head the weather could not be finer. Mark Brooke Omar and Tony were all great guides and even better companions. A second thing that stood out this visit was that they have streamlined the check in process so it only takes 1 2 minutes. In the past they often seemed less organized and the last thing a guest wants to do when they arrive is to sit for 15 minutes getting checked in. As for the food while I still prefer the old days when the lunch and dinner menu changed at least 5 times during the week I will say that the quality of the food overall has improved in the past year and the dinner entrees on offer have lots of flavor and they allow good customization if a guest does not want it exactly as described. Finally management is in the process of refurbishing the rooms so that combined with the time of year meant the Ranch was not nearly at full capacity. I may be in the minority here but would be perfectly pleased they do not update a subset of the rooms and market them as classic at a reduced price. I can understand how some new guests may arrive expecting 5 star luxury accommodations and be willing to pay up for it but I also suspect there are others like me who think the rooms as they are today are just fine.", "offset": [1430, 1765], "date": "2019-07-08", "cpt": "1", "category": "restaurant"}]}
