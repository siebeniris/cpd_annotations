If you decide to celebrate your anniversary with a visit to Disneyland and California Adventure stay here. My husband and I are LA locals but we decided that coming here to celebrate our twenty ninth year together and our first year of marriage might be fun. We were welcomed with enthusiastically open arms. Of the hotel itself everything the other reviewers write is accurate the hotel is beautifully designed but it needs some refreshing the rooms are a bit small if it is two of you get a single king bed and then there is room for a sofa and lounge chair too the spectacular lobby is where you will want to relax and yes the hotel is really expensive. The service we received was extraordinary starting with the telephone reservation agent. She asked if the visit was for a special occasion and swung into action as soon as I explained our situation. On our arrival our desk receptionist was cheerful and sweet and amazingly efficient. She made sure our bags were stored until the room was ready while we went on to the park. Just give us your cell phone number and we will text you when it is ready. She made sure we had a dinner reservation there is a conference going on here so the hotel is full but the good news is that none of them will be in line ahead of you at the attractions and paid special attention to when we had be going down to the Napa Rose Restaurant for dinner. Finally she proudly presented us with badges to wear reading Happy Anniversary Alan and Mike 29 years. She gushed Put them on. Put them on. Somewhat embarrassed but amused we did so for her. Have a wonderful time. Come see me if you need anything. A moment later as we walked through Downtown Disney at nine am a groundskeeper looked up and called out Happy Anniversary. Thanks we replied somewhat confused and walked on. As we picked up our park passes the ticket clerk said May I wish you happy anniversary. And throughout the day all over Disneyland random park employees wished us a happy anniversary. Same thing at California Adventure the next day. It made us smile every time. That evening at Napa Rose our dessert arrived with Happy Anniversary written around the edge of the plate. And when we returned to our room the bed was covered with rose petals and came with a note from Minie wishing us happy anniversary. It was the best visit imaginable. Cost of the room a lot. Dinner expensive. Park Passes big bucks.

If you can afford it do not hesitate. Both times we have stayed here we have had a room overlooking Downtown Disney. It is almost as if you are staying in the park to be able to go out on your balcony at night and have that venue at your feet. The hotel room was very clean and comfortable but it is the rest of the hotel that really shines. The lobby alone is a super comfortable place to just hang out or wait for others in your party. you will have your own entrance into Disneys California Adventure and staying at this property also allows you to have purchases made in the parks delivered straight to your room.

A review from a non Disney fanatic. \u2022. This was my first Disney trip. Figured we \u2019d do as we did in Aulani and treat ourselves to a Disney hotel. \u2022. This is NOT Aulani We splurged and visit Aulani for our last vacation. The hotel was sublime from detachable showerheads to better bathe your children to provided footstools so the smallest of hands can get easily washed. Those amenities are not here although we naively expected them. \u2022 Booked \u201c Theme Park View \u201d says so right on our reservation. Oops they were out. Gave us a partial view of the pool instead. Claimed it was still \u201c premium \u201d. All I know is that we were shoved at the end of the hall at the far end of the resort nowhere near restaurants or theme park entrances. The man who was helping us seemed distracted as he was training and did n\u2019t realize we were n\u2019t thrilled with the change at all. Sure we got two fast passes as an apology \u2013 for four nights \u2019 of the wrong reservation. They could have at least put us in the same area of the resort as our original selection. \u2022. TV was spotty as in switching from black and white to fuzz then functioning at will. Mentioned it without much reaction. Figured I was n\u2019t there to watch TV so let it go. \u2022. Listen \u2013 there are two perks to this hotel. One get an automatic \u201c Magic Morning \u201d EVERY morning. It switches which park every day Monday is Disney Tuesday is California etc. The other is extremely close access to the parks fantastic when your kid is just OVER walking. My husband and I are all about a splurge when it warrants it. Aulani Disney Cruise sign us up. But no. Not this hotel. Next time we \u2019l do one of the nearby hotels.

They were doing a bit of work around the hotel and two of the nights we were without water for a period of time and on one evening they closed the park early for a private event. that was annoying but the manager gave us a free parkhoper pass for the following day to make up for the inconvenience. My dog and I were treated extremly well during the entire trip all of the staff knew her by name within hours and were quick to add buttons and bling to her service jacket which was quite fun I have to say lol.

Our family just spent 4 days at the Grand Californian at Disneyland and hands down without a doubt it was the best hotel experience I have ever had. I am self employed in the videography business and I have stayed at many high end hotels throughout California San Francisco San Jose Los Angeles Monterey San Diego and more. Production companies want to keep their crew on hand so large multi day conferences means the crew stays where the attendees stay instead of an off site low end hotel. All that to say. I have seen some serious hotels and none have been as great as the Grand Californian. We were greeted at the front gate by a very friendly staff member gave her our reservation confirmation number and a few seconds later when we drove up to the valet area we were welcomed by name by another very friendly staff member. And yes from this point forward every single staff member continued to be warm and friendly and sometimes funny and went above and beyond what I have ever seen at any hotel before. They were so friendly as we checked in gave our kids buttons and stickers and a free photo for our birthday boy. Our 5th floor room was very clean and we had a great view of the pools though we did not have any time to visit them too busy at both parks. The bed linens were clean the entire room smelled fresh and the bathroom was spotless. The entire hotel was always buzzing with activity but even with that much motion the central lobby area was always inviting. A live pianist sometimes MIDI controlled but still providing the proper atmosphere a warm fire beautiful wood everywhere etc. And talk about clean it was nearly perfect everywhere. It was so clean that the few rare occasions I saw trash on the ground I picked it up and threw it away myself just to help out. Checking out was a breeze. Our bellhop stayed with us as we waited for our car and he asked us about our stay and how much fun the kids had. He even offered to take our picture for our final group shot together. My only complaint if you could even call it that was that our car came back from parking and the harsh reality of normal life settled back in as I realized how filthy our windshield was. I do not expect them to wash my car and they may even have that service available but I did not ask but if the car came back with at least the windshield cleaned off for us. I would have probably died. Again a very very minor observation but it did not make a difference in the big picture. Definitely a 5 star experience. I mean seriously have you ever stayed at a hotel where even the cleaning service employees can strike up a conversation and answer almost any question you have all with a smile on their face. Some people may find that annoying and surreal and just a front to keep the customer happy but for us it felt genuine and it made all the difference in the world.

My family spent 3 nights at Disney over spring break. Booked the first two at Disneyland hotel which was awesome and had thought we had splurge on our last night and move over to the Grand Californian. What a disappointment. Rooms were small and nothing special. The courtyard view overlooked the smoking terrace and backed up to monorail. One of the main pools was under construction which was not communicated in advance. What. We are from pacific NW and the lodge theme while beautiful felt dark and out of place in sunny SoCal. No outside eating or drinking spots and the fir trees rather than Palm trees just did not feel like vacation. When you walk in from downtown Disney you walk through the conference area so you get a view of biz mtgs which is kind of a drag and again feels out of place. For 500 per night I really was hoping to be blown away but instead was bummed about the pool construction and mediocre room and left feeling like I wasted good money. This is definitely a quality hotel less disnefied if that is your thing and is conveniently located to the park.

When staying on property at Disney your room key can also be used to charge purchases anywhere in Disney or California Adventure a nice touch. Our room was a bit more on the average side. nicely decorated in a woodsy theme but I was not blown away. Bathroom was surprisingly small for such a deluxe property.

Family Disneyland vacation mixed with a business conference. Benefits1. Location. You can not beat the fact that the hotel has its own entry into California Adventure. No other hotel offers such a benefit2. Wifi. Free and speedy I will take it3. Pool. 3 pools and each pool had at least 3 lifeguards. There is even a small kidie pool with lifejackets for kids of all ages. This is what sets Disney apart from other resorts and companies the attention to detail and service. 4. Registration. Speedy and organized most of these luxury hotels have 2 3 people per desk. Nope the registration desk had nearly a dozen people and very efficient. Nothing is worse when you check in and wait 30 minutes just to get into your room. Risks1. Cost. The cost is very high and I think for most average American families this is a true luxury. Depending on the season a basic room can go for almost 400 50 night. For most families this will be the rate limiting factor and honestly a shame since Disneyland is expensive as is.

This last trip was annoying and concerning. First off they used to golf cart you back and forth between the Grand and the Resort but since security changed that is no longer avaialable. I dropped people off at the Resort and double checked before I left if I could get a ride over to the Grand they said yes but then the lie detector determined that was a lie. then I had to hoof it with all my luggage through downtown Disney on a Sundayafternon not magical. When I did check in they tried to stick me far away but I learned from last time. So they put me in a room in the main lobby area. Now the concerning part. So I took off my wedding ring and store it in the clear glass cup so I do not drop it in the sink and I do not sleep in it. Well the following morning I get up and run over to the conference. I come back around 5 and it is Valentines Day btw. To find my ring is gone. Cup is upside down and ring is gone. I call down to housekeeping. They put me on hold. Then another person gets on the phone and says well they are supposed to check cups before they toss them. So at this point I am pretty sure my ring is in the dishwasher or just gone. Ug I am like it is not a small ring its over a carat center stone with a band on top and bottom and it is appraised at over 150. Once they hear the value of the ring she says she will be right up. All I can think is thank god it is insured because it is gone. Well 45 mins later she shows up and has my ring. I have to sign a release form. Anyways had it not been the most expensive hotel in Disneyland I do not know if I would have gotten my wedding ring back. The hotel is clean but to me the rooms were no different then the Resort.

Although a considerable investment staying as close to the parks as possible was a great way to go with small kids. It allowed us to take breaks for dinner and naps and not need to wake up quite as early to get into the parks with our daily magic hours. Although I would love to give the resort 5 there were things that were not quite up to Disney standards at this resort. The first was not telling us the pools were heated and had a towel stand even during Spring when most people think we are crazy to swim as it is cold outside. The second reason for my reduced rating is that the restaurant host at Storyteller gave us a ten minute wait estimate for a walk in for our group of 8 people. It was lower season when we visited so we thought wow that is great except for the twenty minute wait to be told another twenty after that possibly. If you are unsure I had rather you say so and we can take the young tired and hungry kids elsewhere. Finally it was not until the last night we found out about a couple of family events NOT advertised in the family listing provided upon our arrival. Actually the only family event on the family event list was nightly family movies and then early power walks yoga and pilates for adults. We happened upon a lobby pin trading event and family boardgame night event our last night there and were happy to participate.

Just returned from a quick overnight to the Grand Californian hotel. My parents are DVC members visiting from the east coast and they treated us to 2 rooms at the hotel for my family of four and themselves. We found the hotels recent refurbishment enhanced the quality of our stay from when we visited in 2014. The rooms while still quite small were nicely redone comfortable beds really nice shower bathroom. Christmas decorations in the lobby including the giant gingerbread Californian hotel were lovely. My six year old son really enjoyed spotting the hidden Mickeys Cast members were very friendly and helpful we were able to get some great family pictures in front of the lobbys giant Christmas tree. Loved that they had Santa at night for the kids along with carolers. The holiday spirit was definitely felt. Kudos to the hotel for keeping the pool heated too my kids enjoyed some night swimming even though it was a chilly night. They loved it. Main positive of our stay though was the character breakfast at StoryTellers Cafe. My kids six and three LOVED it. The parade with Mickey Minie Pluto Chip and Dale was spirited and fun. Food was good and enjoyed by all. Best part was the great job the characters did in meeting with the children at our table. They really played their parts well and knew just had to engage each of my kids. My daughter did not want the breakfast to ever end. We were celebrating my sons birthday and they brought us a cute cupcake. Even though it seemed like the restaurant was quite crowded our reservation time was honored and no one made us feel rushed. All cast members were great and based on our experience I would HIGHLY recommend the character breakfast to families. It is worth the cost remember to use your DVC card for a small discountOnly real negative of the stay and worth noting for families with small children or disabled family members. our room was really far away from the main elevator. We also got lost each time we exited our room trying to find the elevator. Would recommend more signage. Also we could hear the fireworks from our room but could not see anything. Would definitely request a room that faces the fireworks next time. While I am not sure the hotel is quite up to the overall price point it charges this hotel really works if you can use your DVC points or want the convenience of being super close to the parks.
