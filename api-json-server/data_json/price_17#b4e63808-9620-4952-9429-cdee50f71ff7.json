My stay was 7 nights. I did not rent a car but used the hotel shuttle which took me anywhere within a 3 mile radius. All drivers were prompt friendly and professional. My wait times for the shuttle were very reasonable. I ate in the restaurant a couple of times and found the food to be good and very reasonably priced. I did have some trouble with my television and called the front desk. Literally within 10 minutes my television was replaced with a new larger set. The front desk staff was very helpful with restaurant and shopping suggestions and even gave me a free beverage one morning when I slept in and missed getting a newspaper. I will definitely stay here next time I am in town. Location cost staff free shuttle within 3 miles restaurant outside sitting areas Close to shopping restaurants movies.

We were looking for a venue for an event on a tight budget and this hotel filled the bill nicely. There were some hiccups along the way but the overall experience was a good one and we would definitely come back. My only complaint was that our mattress was hard as a rock. However we worked so hard and long hours that once my head hit the pillow that really did not matter. The location is great the breakfast is good but overpriced unles it comes with your room rate but parking is crazy. You have to park all the way up a steep hill and hope you do not roll all the way down after you park your car. The stairs are not immediately easily marked when you are headed back to the hotel. And if you have back knee issues you should probably stay elsewhere. I have had Hiltons breakfast in other Hilton properties and this is the best so far. Beats even the Hilton across from Disney Springs in Orlando. Location. you are less than 5 minutes from Perimeter Mall and shopping dining at plenty of great places. you are 5 minutes from the Perimeter Dunwody MARTA station that can take you to the airport and all points downtown in Atlanta including Lenox Mall Buckhead. I would DEFINITELY come back to this hotel again if I were staying in Atlanta for any length of time. Also since it was a property included in my credit cards rewards plan it was an extra bonus. Overall good experience even considering the minor snags we had with our event. The staff did rectify those little issues in a timely and polite manner too.

A lawsuit waiting to happen. it is very scary walking to your room. Speaking of the room. my first impression was. ok this is not too bad for the price. But when I laid in the bed I understood the discounted rate. That has to be THE most uncomfortable mattress I have EVER used. I have just awakened but I feel like I have not slept at all. I am here celebrating a birthday but I am too sleepy to do anything. They should throw this mattress away immediately. The sheets and pillow cases are dingy and every time I open the bedroom door my kids wake up. it is so old and squeaky. Speaking of kids I asked for a pack and play and the outside of it was so disgusting that I never even opened it. I will definitely choose another hotel next time.

We stayed here for a weekend recently for a college reunion get together. First problem started at check in. We checked in unloaded luggage while I waited in lobby my husband went to park car.

He then went to explain since we were there visiting or for a meeting even though he said we were registered. Finally the clerk who checked us in was free gave us a parking permit. I asked why that was not given when we checked in said he did not know we were parking. You have to park in garage in most cases there is some Disabled Parking near hotel a few Diamond members parking we are diamond but none available. They did reimburse him for the parking charge. We were given a room on the top floor but it was an adjoining room one of my preferences is not to have that. One strange thing was the doors. The door into room obviously opened in but the closet door opened out so did the bathroom which was unusual so you have 3 doors opening into each other can hit someone. The safety bar in shower was not put in correct location unles you were going to straddle the toilet to get in out no way you can hold onto it while in shower. Apparently one of the 2 elevators was broken but no sign was ever put on door to let people know. So always a wait full elevators since hotel was full.
