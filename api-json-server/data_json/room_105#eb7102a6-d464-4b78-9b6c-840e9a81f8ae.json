This time booked a club Residence room. What service. Private check in on the Club Lounge level on 10th floor. Great service from the Club staff. Best part is the cocktails between 530p730p. Complimentary water soft drinks beer wine spirits mixed drinks and food. Not just finger food but a complete buffet. After eating here there was no need to go out to eat. What an oasis this proved to be in a hot HCMC. Come back from shopping in Ben Thanh Market pr wherever drop goodies off in room. Quick shower clean clothes then straight to the Club Lounge in time for the goodies at 530pm and in air conditioned comfort. For the difference in room price between standard and club it is definitely worth it. The breakfast can also be taken in the Club Lounge. Almost everything they offer in the main restaurant on the ground floor. but without all the comonersAl other services in the hotel are great including the pool and fitness area rooms. The only complaint I have is that the hotel still allows smoking in the bar lounge area and the smoke tends to waft across the reception lobby area and even in to the restaurant area. For this reason the hotel never got any bar business from us. Hotel Management please make your entire lobby area non smoking. It stinks. it is the only reason why I would not give a 5 rating to this hotel.

On entering the hotel at the ground level I had to navigate a rabbit warren through to the elevators and up to the reception area. The staff at reception were exceptionally helpful.

The concierge desk tried their best whenever i requested some infos and helps. They offered an maps and pho suggestion. however one of your teams suggestion was not meet my expectations tho haha. but i appreciate the helps. Pho hung in benh thanh market was much better then one in cross the hotelThe nicest thing was lobby desk offered me an upgrade to newly renovated club rooms except the lounge access there were trouble with tripcom agency but that s my side of deal. The newly renovated room was just too fantastic. It would be one of the most modern room in 5star grade hotel surrounding in HCMso anyone who books this hotel go for 11th floor club room and requesting the newly renovated rooms when you check in. i stayed at 13Moreover hotel helped my lost item in HCM to be get held over the desk so i can find a courier to get back in my hands. They did excellent jobs to contact the restaurant for me and to get back to hotel and then handed in to personal so i can get it to my hands. I certainly do appreciate all your helps in concierge team and lobby desk team that i can get my item back even it was not left inside of the hotel. Thanks again for that. However there were one issues with communicating in between agencies and hotel and to me. It starts from where i booked my additional day at expedia on the wrong day as i did it by rush. Thankfully hotel offered me to get me moved to the right day. However They requested me to contact expedia service center so that they can send an email to hotel and hotel can send back. That way both side can have clear proof so no problem will going to be happened. But the issue hapend where hotel email system had an error I do believe that your hotel tried at your best to send back as one of your front desk personal showed me that he sent multiple times during the early morning i get down to complaint about itI had to call the service center multiple times by international phone calling. Yikes it was roughly 3hrs of calling time and it costs me a. well i do not know what happened exactly. I contacted 3 supervisor at service center they all said they send and called them no answer did it again no answer. But the last supervisor actually did her best to get this fixed. I had to kept my phone for 25hrs and well what they did was reboked for me. So except this issue My stays in this hotel was just too great to be truehowever it did gave me a bad taste I did actually took 2stars off.
