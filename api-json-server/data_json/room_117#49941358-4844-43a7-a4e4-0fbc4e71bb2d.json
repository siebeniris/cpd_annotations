Was a convenient location being about a 10 minute walk from the Central subway stop to major destinations and is located in a fun area populated by a lot of expats. We did not hear any street noise and we were on the 9th floor. The only issue is ease of getting there from the hotel if you have a lot of bags. it is in the mid levels area so if you are trying to get here by train subway you will be walking up a lot of stairs. You can just take a cab for around 350HKD to from airport though which was easy and painless. The room itself was great with free wifi free minibar free snacks with a comfortable and modern decor.

I stayed here for five days with my husband over a weekend. The service was great. Everyone was friendly and helpful. The rooms were big and very comfortable. Loved the design of the room. did not feel like a hotel room. but instead it felt like I was coming home every evening. Everything you need is in that room. Even an Apple TV and a printer which was super handy. there is only two rooms on each floor so it is very quiet. You do not hear the usual footsteps and closing of doors of regular hotels. Breakfast is included and is separated from the hotel itself. You need to exit and the restaurant is right beside the hotel entrance. The restaurant is opened to the public but has a separate reserved dining area for hotel guests. I thought this idea was great. Every morning we were able to see regular commuters in and out grabbing coffees breakfast or holding short breakfast meetings. It made breakfast on holiday a whole different experience from the usual hotel restaurant. It was always busy but staff made sure the hotel guests were taken care of. One night we wanted to order room service so went to reception to see what was on offer. Staff gave me a list of choices and ordered it for me. On the phone we realised this particular restaurant did not do deliveries so I offered to go pick it up instead. However the hotel staff insisted that he would go to pick it up for me even though at this point he was the only one manning the reception area his colleague was out doing another room service run. I thought this was exceptional and needed mentioning as he went out of his way to make our stay seamless. Oh and the free mini bar. it is included as part of the hotel deal. Great concept so you do not need to go to he convenience store because you are worried about racking up a huge hotel bill. it is even restocked. Brilliant idea. Great hotel.

The staff from the security guard at the front door to the reception area to the room service were ALL top notch and wanted to assist me with anything I needed.

The room has an Amazon Alexa unit with a big Harmon Kardon speaker to listen to whatever you want. If you know how to use the Alexa system this is quite nice and no need to turn on the TV in the room while you do email personal grooming or other tasks. The breakfast is at The Diner next door.

Staff nice. I have stayed here before and I had two big issues. 1. I think the free minibar is not as extensive as it used to be. I booked at a higher price through the ovolo website to get free mini bar. Definitely was not worth the extra price2. THE CONSTRUCTION NOISE. This was not at all disclosed when I booked the room and made my stay extremely unpleasant as I wanted to sleep in. For a hotel in the middle of LKF where people often go out late especially on weekends this needed to be disclosed. I would have stayed elsewhere if I had known. I am also not sure if the construction meant the free happy hour was also not available as it was not offered to us by staff. As someone who comes to HK 1 2 times per year for the weekend to party in LKF and also sometimes for work I was extremely let down. I feel for HK30 per night this was nowhere near good enough. In the circumstances I would think a partial refund for goodwill is warranted. I think anyone who stayed under the circumstances would have been very disappointed. I also promoted Ovolo to my friends and encouraged my 3 friends to stay in Ovolo too Douglas Campbell 2x rooms and Michael Barufi 1x room and they were also extremely unhappy with the construction noise.
