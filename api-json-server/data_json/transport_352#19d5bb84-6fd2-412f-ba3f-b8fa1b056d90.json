Rooms were very clean. I booked my hotel through American Airlines and received a rate of 42 night. Hotel staff is friendly every present for questions and security concerns and hotel smells nice every time you enter. This hotel is the old Sahara hotel across from Circus Circus and it still shows signs. While most of it is updated the carpet did not match the rest of the decor. It is still the old carpet come to find out. Good selection of restaurants though the Beer Garden restaurant was a flop for us. The mojitos tasted more like juice than alcohol. The appetizer came out burnt and the food was sub par. As far as location we drove a vehicle so it was easy to go back and forth down the strip. But it is a hike to walk down to the crowded and popular parts of the strip. Though its off the monorail the monorail drops way in the back of the casinos and again a lot of extra walking just to arrive at the strip. We also encountered a negative employee on our last day in the self parking garage elevator. Said the hotel was not doing good financially and they already had to sell off one of their towers for financial reasons. Also their elevator had been broken down for 6 weeks and they just now got it fixed. I did not appreciate the negativity or the construction and round about to get to the monorail in general. For the price I paid I was fine with such inconveniences but I would not have paid the full fair for some of this. I did appreciate the added security of this hotel they have a staff member standing at hotel tower entrance and you have to show your card to enter hallway then use the room key to operate the elevator.", "offset": [650, 739], "date": "2016-02-08", "cpt": "0", "category": "transport"}, {"id": 2, "uid": "6135b246-cc26-4def-9b19-9fec74493ad7", "sentence": "Desolation Row.

I loved the decor of the SLS. I always prefer staying at hotels that are unique and the rooms and the restaurants and bars were all pretty cool. The Monkey Bar is pretty cool and there is a really good happy hour at the sushi restaurant Katsuya. Our room had giant mirrors a sleek couch and a silver wood stump side table. The pool was great not too crowded and it was relaxing. I would definitely say that the SLS is on the quiet side but we enjoyed it. The entrance to the casino is a light up floor that changes colors. The only thing that is a bummer is that it is so far away from the main hub of the strip so we had to spend quite a bit on Taxi rides to go see shows and shop and what not but there are other options for transportation that might have been cheaper monorail bus. The decor and the relaxing atmosphere. Stratosphere Circus Circus Worlds Largest Souvenir Shop. Far away from main strip. Maybe some sort of hotel shuttle.

I had not looked at any reviews of the hotel before going but since looking after returning I can believe people are giving bad reviews to the place. All the staff were extremely friendly and very helpful whenever you needed them. The hotel is at the top end of the Las Vegas strip so away from a lot of the hustle and bustle but for me that was not a bad thingThere is a super reliable bus service the deuce which runs up and down the strip every 15 mins although it seemed more often than that. which can get you right in the action in minutes.

My husband and I travel regularly to Vegas and have stayed at some excellent hotels. Vegas has some great hotels and food. This time we decided to try the SLS due to our family pointing out the great deals they offered over Christmas. The hotel has some quirky and interesting decor but overall there is no cohesion. At one point it seemed like we were in a Nike ad when using the elevators but in the bar there was monkey decor and Eric Clapton pictures in the hall. Our room was very small no tub no coffee no drawers in the desk or nightstands. The worst part of the room was the bed was pushed against a window. The weather was 30 40 degrees during our stay so the window left a cold breeze on our head at night even with the window and blinds closed. Also in the morning the blinds did not shield the bright sun. The room was also noisy with traffic and sirens whizzing by at all hours. There also is not much to do at the SLS so one would likely venture out to the Vegas strip which is roughly two miles or more away. This hotel offers no shuttle. There also is a lack of customer service with some of the staff while some were very friendly others were not. The doormen did nt open the doors when we would return instead they were talking to each other ignoring guests. When we checked out we were not asked how our stay was. I voiced that we were not satisfied with our stay and the hotel staff said nothing then shrugged his shoulders. We would NOT stay here again and we would NOT recommend this hotel. Look for other deals. The Trump is off the strip but offers shuttle service no smoking acomodations and staff are EXCELLENT there.", "offset": [1575, 1683], "date": "2016-12-26", "cpt": "0", "category": "transport"}, {"id": 8, "uid": "54fe3318-8ceb-4ae9-b04d-569d45fdc219", "sentence": "Resort Fees Fed Ex Location. First of all upon my arrival to SLS I had to pay an ADDITIONAL Hotel Resort Fee of 1080. This should have already been included in the package deals through EXPEDIA when booking these reservations. You never know what a persons financial situation may be upon arrival. I had problems with the AC Unit in our room twice but maintenance was quick to respond once I made the phone call to Guest Services. My only other problem was the location of the Fed Ex Office. For a person with a Disability which was me it was a difficult task trying to walk those long hallways with no one else on the floor but me trying to reach the Fed Ex location to use the Computer to print out Boarding Passes for my return flight back home. If I had known in advance where the exact location was I would have requested some assistance. I had to stop on several occasions because of my Disability trying to reach this location going and returning. This location should be more conveniently located to assist persons that have Disabilities. This was very inconvenient and so very far away from any other activity within the Hotel. This was NOT a Secure nor Safe position to be in at all. Anyone could have ben hiding on that floor and attack a person especially a Female as I am. I really did like the Quick Response of the Valet attendance. The location was not a problem because I had a rental car to take me anywhere I wanted to go.
