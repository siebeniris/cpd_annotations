I booked SLS for three nights while attending the KBIS IBS show at the Convention Center. It is very close to the Convention Center for all you business travelers still need to take a shuttle but quick ride and it does not stop at a ton of hotels for pick up drop off. We arrived around 60 pm on a Monday and there was no line at the reservation desk. Asked if there were any rooms available on a higher floor with a view and was told that I had already been upgraded to the a high floor on the Lux tower. What a great way to start out the trip. Thank you SLSIn a nutshell my room was fabulous. Very clean spacious beautiful furniture and nice bathroom amenities. My favorite parts the super comfortable bed the fun mirror above the bed tisk tisk and the big window in the shower looking out over the Stratosphere. The shower itself was heavenly with two showerheads and just the right amount of water pressure. I did not gamble so can not speak to the casino. love the Fred Segal shops. did eat at the Griddle place for breakfast. Had to wait for about 20 minutes but it was packed so understandable. Good food at a great price. Another positive was the smell of the hotel strange to say I know. but it had a great lavendar smell to it. Almost like a spa. A lot better than smelling smoke at others hotels on the strip. And in the mornings I swear they pump in a coffee smell in the elevators it smelled heavenly. The taxi line was manageable compared to the larger hotels and valet doormen etc. all very nice. One night our group was offered the SLS SUV at no charge because taxis were all busy and we had 7 people. To me that is service and going the extra mile to please your guests. Next time would love to stay when the pool is open and play a little blackjack.", "offset": [26, 115], "date": "2015-01-23", "cpt": "0", "category": "venue"}, {"id": 2, "uid": "f51e3ea3-b04e-460a-8e54-a1f42ab95a58", "sentence": "Brand New. Already Tired I stayed at the SLS Las Vegas for a work event. I have no idea why my company had to switch from the Cosmopolitan read my review to the SLS. From the moment I walked in and had to wait in line for 15 minutes to check in I knew it was not going to be a good stay. The decor was weird. Behind the front desk was video screen showing a really creepy monkey not doing much of anything except being super creepy. What is it with Vegas and bizarre decorating techniques. The carpet already looked old in the brand new hotel and the lobby had a small bar that seemed totally out of place across from the front desk. In fact the entire place looked tired. New. The place was brand new. Hard to believe. Anyway. I got to my room finally and found it to be so incredibly uncomfortable. Beware if you are there on business the room is NOT set up for a business person. The desk is this odd shaped cockeyed rectangle with no handy outlets for any electronics. And the clock radio was so complicated that I felt I completed my doctoral dissertation by figuring out how to set it. The room also smelled musty like cigarette smoke and there was too much thought in making it kitchy rather that functional. Too bad. Also there is nothing in the room on how to access the wifi. It took me two calls to Guest Services to finally log on. All the information is on the TV dining etc. I ordered room service. The food was okay but by the time I figured everything out and got my food I was so exhausted I had to go to bed. However sleep was not meant for me. The noise from outside was so loud there was no escaping it. Too bad in all the planning the addition of a white noise machine did not cross anybodys mind.

The hotel is a boutique style hotel and is well fashionably done in the sophisticated timeless classic black and white. The hotel room was very clean and relaxing.

There was not any decor on the walls. Just mirrors everywhere. The hidden toilet shower area were a bright yellow tile. This area actually appeared immaculate. This is my first review of a hotel on trip advisor so hopefully this is helpful to others. For the price we paid I would stay here again if we had something at the convention center to attend. Otherwise I would rather stick to the 5 star hotels near the middle of the strip. Sorry I did not think to take any pics of the room. Just pics of myself in the room.

We were in town for a tournament and stayed at the SLS for a week. My main complaint is that there are no top sheets on any of the beds just a comforter. And you know they do not wash the comforters between guests. So you are basically sharing a top sheet with everyone who has stayed there before you. Ew. Very small rooms no coffee maker fridge bath tub etc. I am a gambler. Not a place to gamble casino is small and little action. All restaurants are closed by 930. There is a pool area right off the casino but it is used for special events. Apparently you get tickets to these events through local radio stations which really does not work for out of town guests. With the exception of the sheet issue this hotel is not awful for the price. But with so many great options in Vegas that prefer guests to locals in their pools and nightclubs I definitely will not be returning.

I have just spent the weekend at the SLS Las vegas and thought I had share a few observations about this hotel. Overall it is a clean modern hotel. However if you are intending to use this as a room to sleep than it may be an option for you If however like me you plan on using the hotel for a relaxing resort stay than stay somewhere elsea few reasons for this are listed below. I stayed in the story tower and the rooms are SMALL just about big enough for one person. The room has zero space for storage and you will be bashing into each other. Getting ready is an unpleasant experience. Pros. the maids are really nice and do a great job. Food Not much to choose from and it has restaurant that are only open on certain days. quite strange with this said options are limited. Crazy that in vegas you have one coffee shop that closes at around 9ish. Pool Where do I start. This is a big deal for me. I want somewhere that I can site and relax for a few hours when in Vegas. They have two pools at this property one is the Lux pool which was closed over the weekend for an event. I did manage to use the facility on the friday and was unable to get a sun lounger. the pool area is so incredibly small. I would say there were about 40 loungers in total. the rest were cabanas. The other option is foxtail. I was permitted entry but again no lounge chairs to sit and relax. The only option was a lounger with food and bev at 50. I mean come on seriously. If pool room food are not of great importance then this place may be for you otherwise choose somewhere else. SLS has forgotten what makes vegas the best holiday destination and its not just partying. pools should be available for use to relax at and not just thumping with music all day long. Better still why not make a bigger pool for those who want to get away from the music instead of something so small which appears to be used for special events and rarely available to the public.", "offset": [1022, 1126], "date": "2015-09-21", "cpt": "0", "category": "venue"}, {"id": 8, "uid": "fa90dfb4-1a87-467b-a0ee-e125d532dbcf", "sentence": "Good value classy accommodation in Vegas.

Great service. Nice SPG addition for Vegas. Was traveling for a mix of business and pleasure and was in town for a conference and since it was in Vegas I had my fianc\u00e9 tag along for the 3 day trip. Upon arrival the check in desk is conveniently right around the corner from valet which means you do not have to walk a mile to get to the registration desk and to the rooms. Everything for the hotel side is conveniently located to one side of the property so getting in and out is a breeze. Restaurants and clubs are by the casino which is just around another corner. Check in was very pleasant and a breeze the agent Carla was very nice and helpful in answering any questions my fianc\u00e9 had and also with my monorail questions. As an SPG platinum guest we were given an upgrade to the luxury tower rooms which had all the amenities you would need. Also was given a couple of complimentary drink vouchers for my loyalty. So AwesomeThe room was very spacious and quirky in design. White tapestries and a mirror above the bed was something I can not say I have ever experienced but it was really cool to try. The bed is super comfy not to soft or firm. just right. Since I was there for business I did need a workspace and I did find their desk in the room to be just fine. The room had a great open shower that faced the stratosphere which was really colLocation is a bit north of all the action but with easy access with the monorail I had no transportation issues during my stay. It is very close to the convention center so it was perfect for me. Experienced one hiccup at checkout where the rate of our room listed as almost double on our bill for each night and also various minibar charges that we did not consume. I showed them the confirmation email and the Asian manager fixed it right away. He even offered to pick up some coffee and pastries for the inconvenience but we were in a hurry to catch a flight and could not take him up on that.
