I visited the historic Meguro Gajoen for a business meeting and dinner. This was my second time there. It is a luxury hotel for Japanese standard. I did not stay at this hotel in this trip but my business associates did. The hotel has only 27 rooms both Japanese and Western style. The room sizes are relatively large for Japanese standards. Everywhere you turn inside the hotel was very eye pleasing. The walls and ceiling were decorated with either Japanese traditional painting or wood craving. The staff were very polite however not all of them were fluent in English. The lunch high tea was very reasonable price and very pleasant location next to the outdoor waterfall and Koi pond. This hotel is about 10 min walk from Meguro Station and very close the Meguro River. In all this place is not to miss if you are visiting Tokyo in Meguro area at least go for lunch even if you do not stay there.", "offset": [313, 372], "date": "2015-12-06 00:00:00", "cpt": "0", "category": "room"}, {"id": 3, "uid": "ce416cb9-bd97-4d60-a200-a3179c66a3da", "sentence": "Exceptional. We were delighted with the hotel and the facilities. The staff were typically Japanese helpful respectful and polite. The entrance is delightful the rooms are large even by Western standards. We could see Fuji san and the sakura along the Megaro River from our window. Short walk to the JR station or hotel shuttle. Lawson up the elevator so no need to spend on breakfast if you do not wish too. In room dining is great and not too expensive all things considered.

Gajoen Tokyo was built in 1990s during the peak of Japanese economy. They spent tremendous amount of money to build this impressive wedding place. There are several restaurants. The Japanese one in particular is worth visiting. The dinning room is located right next to the indoor waterfall. Its atmosphere is so tranquil and traditional Japanese.

My husband booked this place for our honeymoon and when we arrived we found out we they upgraded us to an executive room. When we arrived in the room huge btw there was flowers cranes and a nice card wishing us a happy marriage. The bathroom was the highlight of the room. There was a jacuzi steam room and separate shower. There are multiple restaurants on the ground floor of different cuisines. Most of them have a set menu and are quite pricey. We had afternoon tea at the Pandora lounge and their Italian burger both reasonably priced. We had one fancy night at RISTORANTE CANOVIANO the Italian restaurant. It was good but probably will not go back as it was not good enough to justify the price. We also had lunch buffet at the Kanade Terrace and their chowder soup was amazing. Regarding language Only the check in staff understood English and some of the restaurant servers spoke some English so you may still need to bring a translation book. Overall this hotel is catered to Japanese people. Note about massages This hotel does not have an onsite spa facility unfortunately so they hire 3rd party massage therapists.

My family and I stayed at Hotel Gajoen for three nights earlier this month. From the moment we arrived the stay was perfect. The check in was very smooth and personal the room was very large for Tokyo and perfect for a family of four. Everything about the hotel is elegant and the steam bath in the room and free phone were great. The kids loved the matcha tea ceremony and all the staff were helpful and accommodating. A few earlier reviews mention a walk up the hill to get to the station.
