Absolutely lovely hotel and could not find fault with anything. The room was spacious and the sea view fantastical rooms have sea viewsThe beds were so comfortable you did not want to get up in the morning. Breakfast was a mixture of hot and cold with fruits cereals pastries all excellently displayed and very fresh. Coffee and tea were waiter service. All the staff were so genuine and helpful opening doors hailing taxis waiter services they could not do enough for you. We had a particularly wonderful breakfast staff member called Sergio who was so attentive and took note of all that you said. My daughter mentioned the strawberries were lush and he shortly appeared with strawberries dipped in chocolate from the fridge. On our last day he asked if we would like coffee on the terrace and brought a farewell present of mini chocolates with a goodbye message in chocolate on the plate.

The Good the Not so Good. We just arrived back from a beachside vacation where we stayed here for 8 nights. I have decided to list all of the good qualities then all of the qualities that need to be improved. The Good Location right on the beach. Plenty of loungers to chose from. The drinks and food offered were good. The food quality delicious. The Bad beachThe beach had plenty of packets of ketchup mustard bottle caps and general debris in it. The beach should be maintained in a better manner. The service was painfully slow. At one point one of the waiters gave us the eye roll when he returned with our bill 45minutes later and we all ordered something else. The Rooms. The Good Spacious clean comfy beds great showers and great products with views you can not beat. Lots of elevators so generally very little wait to get one. We had a few lovely surprises left in the room for us as a welcome and thank you. The Bad We were given the privilege of being able to call to select what time we would like our room serviced. It did not happen. We asked for food to be removed from our rooms and called down to front desk that did not happen. We had to call almost daily for drink glasses or replacement wine glasses. Not sure why we had to do this they needed replacing. The PolsThe Good. Lots of white lounge chairs and sun beds are available and there are two swimming pools to enjoy. The pools are lovely. The avaiblitily of towels was greatly appreciated and never a problem. The staff was friendly and greeted you nicely. The drinks selection and food choices were good and excellent quality. The Bad Not enough cots for such a large resort. The pools were sometimes overcrowded. The drinks orders took ages. Some food orders literally did not come at all and we were going to be charged for them so please be aware of this. There was never an issue to get the charges corrected but took some of the shine off of the experience. The children at the pool were allowed to play with water toys balls to be exact. This should be absolutely forbidden. There is a beach for this an entire beach so this should be looked after. It is not the fault of the W Hotel for screaming children of others as this place will attract a moneyed my kids are your problem type of behaviour but at least NO TOYS at the pool would help. The CabanasThe Good There are a few cabanas for rent to chose from. They range in price from 250 euros to 500 euros for the one singular special cabana. The special cabana is lovely has it is own jacuzi mini bar sun beds table and chairs tv. washroom showers products galore and the service to go along with it. Fresh fruit gets delivered along with sodas infused water and ice etc. There is also a bar menu from which you can select and order. The cabana is rented from 10 am until 7pm. The Bad The cabana is not ready on time for 10 am. However the stay was extended. There was plenty of lovely staff to great us everyone of them very nice but the dishes did piled up. The larger lounge chair had some long hairs in the crevices so maybe it should be a little more maintained. The Restaurants including the main lobby Bravo Salt the Wave Bar and the strip of restaurants on the Playa. Not all owned by the W so some independentThe Good. The food at each and every restaurant was fresh and delicious and the breakfasts at Bravo were superb. The Bad Not being able to secure a single nights reservation over the coarse of three evenings at Bravos not one. There is no preference for W clients so we did have to go elsewhere. Bravo needs to pick up the service quite a bit. We often waited endlessly for coffee one morning our eggs did not even arrive until 15 minutes AFTER we left. We know this because our friends were eating at the next table and saw this. We noticed many of the customers finger taping while waiting for something or other. So All in All I am still pleased we came to the Hotel however this is a very pricey Luxury Hotel and it is harder to forgive what I would classify as a few rather large over sites.

After staying in the Miramar Hotel last year we decided to crank it up another notch for our short escape this year and booked the Cool Corner Suite at the W Hotel in Barcelona. The people at the entrance and reception were very helpful and it took us less than 10 minutes before we got access to our room even though it was only 1 PM when we arrived officially the room is ready at 3 PM. I have to say the reception area was less impressive than you would expect from one of the top hotels in a major city like Barcelona and certainly less impressive than some people have told me. As long as you kept your vision horizontally things looked very luxurious but if you looked up the high rust colored walls going up 6 floors with uninspiring graffiti like decorations and glass barriers reminded me of outdated senior citizen hotels on Gran Canaria. Yes I have stayed there too. The room was located at the very back of the long red hallway on the 19th floor. Our luggage was delivered to the room 2 minutes after we arrived great service. The first thing you see upon entering is the spatious living room with large windows that provide you with an amazing panorama view on the sea and Barcelona Port with its superyachts and cruise ships. The suite has a has futuristic yet very comfortable carpet in the rooms and a high quality dark tile floor in the bathroom. The living room has 3 nice couches a large tv and modern lighting with a copper look. However when you enter the bedroom with its huge sized comfortable bed stand alone bathtub and another 2 comfortable couches you start to wonder what good the living room is for especially since you have got the same large tv available here as well. I guess some types of people tend to bring extra guests into their room in which case there is surely enough furniture for them to pass out on. The tilted ocean view through the panoramic windows is absolutely amazing and gives you the feeling of being inside a huge cruise ship in the middle of the ocean without the boat sounds and moving up and down on the waves luckily. Sailboats and yachts continually pass your view only adding to the unique experience. The bath comfortably fits 2 regular non american sized people and the rainshower is from a superb quality which is located in a space the size of entire bathrooms in some hotels. For couples the suite provides you with everything you need for your luxurious romantic getaway. Waking up and opening the blinds with the push of a button providing you once more with the best ocean view you can get kind of makes you feel as if you are staying in Iron Mans house. The breakfast buffet was very complete with everything a normal person can think of and in case you consider yourself more than that you can always order specials at will. A very nice touch from the romkeping was that they actually washed out my wine glass from the previous night and put it next to the half empty bottle of reserve Rioja that we bought in the city instead of sticking to procedure and putting it back with the other glass in the living room liquor cabinet. Lovely personal touch how they already identified that only one of us has a drinking problem. All but the most excentric sorrow drowning millionaires those however usually get the even more lavish extreme wow suite will be happy to hear that you can find enough alcoholic beverages in both the living and bedroom fridges at priced high enough to feel properly ripped off even if you usually pretend that money is not an issue. By the second night however even the highest standard of luxury seems to somewhat normalize to a person and you start looking more at the little details. Unfortunately I have to say that those details are not up to standards with what you would expect from a room that goes at a rate of around 80 euros per night. Some exampes the painters somehow managed to smudge half a bucket of paint on the airconditioning vent just under the ceiling the very designy looking piece of furniture next to the bathtub which by the way is a perfect fit for a laptop to watch Game of Thrones on while having a bath with your not american sized partner in crime unfortunately showed massive signs of wear on the coppery top platform and two of the ceiling lights seemed to have attempted multiple escape attempts with heavy cracks in the paint as a consequence. On top of that the wall between the shower room and the bedroom showed clear signs of water damage. Nothing that would ever bother you in a regular hotel room but at this price level you expect close to perfection. The architect who designed the hotel got a ton of praise but I am kind of confused as to why someone so skilled would not think of the fact that if you can not open the panoramic windows you also can not clean the 1 m wide concrete platform outside of it either. Our friend Mr Seagull owner of that particular platform decided to punish this design flaw in the form dozens of brownish art pieces. Takes away a bit from the experience when you are looking at an actual pirate ship arriving from the endless blue. The architects second mistake is the location of the so called sundeck with mandatory infinity pool never quite understood the point of those. A more appropriate name would be deck of the eternal shadow as with the exception of perhaps mid July when the sun is all the way up in the sky the hotel blocks the sun from shining on this deck the entire afternoon. Also Mr Bofil when you design a near 100 m tall hotel it might be smarter and classier to put the pool somewhere else than on the first floor. I know clubers demand their top floor vulgarities but with 25 more stories to spare there was ample opportunity for a Marina Bay Sands style pool which would then have actually been a true sun deck as well. Two birds with one stone. A last thing to mention is that the room itself is perfectly wheelchair accessible but the designer somehow forgot to put a wide door in the 4 square meter shower room which I can imagine would take away some of the luxury feeling if you have to crawl your way into the bathroom to enjoy your lovely rainshower. The staff however is so helpful that I can imagine that they would be fine with carrying you in and out so maybe that softens the issue. We tried the Spa which has all the amenities you would expect but again some design flaws are made by the designer. There are no loungers next to the very small indoor pool and I mean so small that 2 people can not comfortably swim next to eachother only a long bench to sit uncomfortably on. The sauna and steambath are ok but again this area only has 6 loungers and another one of those ugly benches. but I can imagine how busy this place must be during high season. The website marketed this place as huge but I have honestly seen larger pools and saunas in boutique hotels with 10 rooms. The Koh I Nor in Val Thorens for example proves how you can still make a smaller Spa area look classy and comfortable while a space shortage is hardly an excuse to begin with in this W hotel. Not really what you would expect. Conclusion. The W Hotel provides you with extravagant luxury and most amazing views over Barcelona and the breakfast is great. The staff is extremely helpful and brings a personal touch to make you feel 100 comfortable. The Reception area looks unfinished and the Pool and Spa zone for hotel guests is way too small and lacks the touch of a proper interior designer. The architect also made some clear errors designing the building. Still the overall experience and one of the best views to wake up to that you will ever get more than make up for these mistakes.", "offset": [422, 615], "date": "2019-05-01", "cpt": "1", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 17, "uid": "dc398ead-a64e-4d4a-87fc-44b5a51a9ae0", "sentence": "Nice location nice hotel from outside disaster quality inside.

The hotel staff was helpful and tried to find a better room with less noise but this process took ages we had to spend about an hour waiting at the reception to change our room. So even if you see that the staff is trying to be of help you have mixed feelings. I was offered with some discount appreciated due to the discomfort from the noise which however was not automatically reflected in the system so during the checkout you need to remind the staff of what you have been provided explain the whole story again etc. So annoying. 20 minutes checkout is definitely not appropriate for 5 hotel.
