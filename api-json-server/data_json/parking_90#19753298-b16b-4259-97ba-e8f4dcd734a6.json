Stayed at the Radison Blu from June 4 June 7 we came to Milan for a few nice days of shopping and sightseeing. came to the Hotel by car there are a few parking spaces outside of the hotel but most of the time they are all occupied. The hotel also offers a Parking garage for around 20 Euros per day which is a reasonable price for Milan. We booked a Business Class Room it was very nice clean modern the bed was very comfy the room had a nice view the bathroom was very nice with a bathtub and a separate shower. We did have one problem the Shower was a little clogged and the water always ran out but other than that everything else was greatAl amenities that you would need were there. The room was a good size for Italy. Breakfast was very good so many choices of great food. The area is not the best but for us that did not really matter. The tram is a few feet away that will bring you to the city center in about 20 25 minutes it is a very cheap way to get there. With a Taxi you will pay around 20 Euro. Staff is overall very friendly and very helpfulCheck in Check Out very quick. No problems Liked this hotel a lot.

We just stayed 3 nights at the Radison blue in Milan. We booked with ebokers as the Radison page crashed 3 times when I tried to book in the office. So the first downer was you do n\u2019t get Carlson Rewards as it seams not to be the nights you stay but where you book. Other chains do n\u2019t do that and frankly speaking that might be for us a point why we would prefer another chain with our next booking. In general we had a nice stay and we where lucky enough to be able to park in front of the hotel on the 3 3stret so we saved the 20Euros the hotel is charging for parking per night. We got a room on the eight floor 82 with a nice view. It was nice spacy and very clean even for my wife which is picky about it. Still it is about the little things I believe which make it from good to great. As in most hotel rooms the bathroom is the critical part also here I recommend to the housekeeping manager to have a seat on the toilet and look at what the guest sees. Check the photo \u2026 I noticed the toilet brush was clean and new and also the toilet seat was clean but due to usage the plastic turned yellow and looks \u201c yaki \u201d. The bathroom door needs also a fix as in the lower parts the paint is coming of. Bed nice but hard for me and ok for my wife \u2026 you can never please everybody I loved the hard pillow and my wife didn\u2019t. Elevator be warned these are the slowest elevator doors ever. I hit myself almost every day as I am just used to the doors to open faster and maybe with less noise too. Breakfast nice choice well presented and a pretty good coffee I sayHot food was more or less cold which is a known problem but still annoying. I would also recommend to take the bacon apart before frying or baking it would be not sticking together and could actually turn crisp. Service nice and friendlyjust to make a note if a customer is asking for a clean spoon do n\u2019t explain him it is only a water spot and start a discussion just bring a fresh spoon say you are sorry and get on with your day.", "offset": [432, 613], "date": "2016-02-16", "cpt": "0", "category": "parking"}, {"id": 8, "uid": "aa260f34-c7ca-4b88-8fd4-56608dd3a5ac", "sentence": "Great hotel.
