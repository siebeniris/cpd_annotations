This is truly the quietest sleepiest resort I have ever been to. I would have been nice to have a little music by the pool. I did feel the staff primarily around the pool area were very nice. The pools were great and they had a nice area at the beach. Our room while nice was on the disappointing 1 floor. Under the lobby. We had a slight view of the pool and beach. It would have been nice to have a higher floor. This resort had absolutely zero Mexican culture. I saw more culture at the Buba Gumps Restaurant at Cancun Airport than this resort. I arranged for a late checkout on my departure until 1 PM. At 12 Noon my keys were deactivated. I had already had it arranged and had to go back to the Front Desk. Overall I liked the resort but I felt that because I was not a Mariot Rewards member I was not cared for or looked after. Unfortunately I will be cancelling my JW Mariot Reservation in Houston because of this feeling.", "offset": [175, 233], "date": "2015-01-08", "cpt": "0", "category": "pool"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "2aae547e-67a0-42eb-872b-0c1ce893a0ab", "sentence": "Relaxing getaway. Spent a very relaxing week here over the holidays and will certainly return in the future. I will preface my review by disclosing I travel frequently and am a bit picky especially as it relates to Mariot properties. This hotel was apparently at full capacity but it did not feel overwhelmingly crowded as the grounds are quite large. You really do not have to leave the hotel everything you could need for rest relaxation and food drinks albeit a bit pricey are all there. However if you want entertainment you will have to venture out. Pros. Great views from decent sized balcony fits two people comfortably if in a standard ocean view room quick room service ordered about 4x during trip and arrived within 15 mins each time large private bathroom large modern gym facility the relaxing spa large gift shop with snacks and a made to order deli adults only pool area great breakfast buffet no long lines to get food the servers are pleasant and will never let your coffee or juice be empty for too long before asking if you want a refill even at the busiest of hours in the AM. The chef was always smiling and rapidly finished made to order items as requested pleasant maid service and abundance of toiletries. Cons Not many. But the polside lounge chair extremely comfortable padded chairs by the way situation you will read from other reviewers is very accurate. Very disappointing that if you do not wake up to lay claim to a chair you will be shut out until after 3 PM or so. You need to claim a chair no later than 7am no matter which pool area you consider. Amazing. Families start sending a representative out by 530 AM to claim their territory by placing all their belongings on chairs rearranging the setups then disappearing for hours until the rest of their party wake up work out go to breakfast go fishing possibly etc who knows. saw so many chairs unoccupied for hours on end but since they were claimed by guests by leaving an item on them you could not get a seat. I believe in early bird gets the worm. but it really is frustrating and takes away from the experience of sitting polside drinking a cocktail while overlooking the ocean. Not sure how the JW could even try to address this to keep all guests happy as even adding more chairs does not necessarily seem to be a solution. But it is no exaggeration get there while it is dark in the AM or you can forget about any kind of a ocean view polside experience. Only consolation is the private beach with an abundance of space and chairs so if you are not an early riser you can usually get a spot on the beach without hassle. Jacuzi adjacent to gym was large and great temp but I did not stay in it long after noticing the water was dirty. They have multiple showers and towels next to it prior to entry but do not think they are used as often as they should by guests which should be an absolute requirement. Hard to enforce that though. Only needed to see that once to avoid going back in it during trip. No complimentary water bottles in room. Other Took advantage of a relaxing discounted massage at their Spa. Pricey even with the discount but price also gives you access to separate spa level with a superb steam room sauna jacuzis and lounge separate sides for men and women. You can pay for access to the level without a massage if you are looking for a quieter atmosphere. Spent hours up there using the sauna steam room shower and jacuzis as I drank complimentary fruit flavored water. If you are a Rewards Member do not expect to be treated exactly as you would in the US or at any other Mariot property as Mariot Resort Spa properties such as this hotel do not offer the same benefits. No exec lounge access unles you book a room with Club 91 access or pay for it if available. As a Premium Member I did receive free internet 15 off breakfast buffet 10 off gift shop purchases and two free coffees or tea per day self serve in gift shop but always enough there and very clean area to prepare your drink. They also provided me with coupons for discounts at their spa and for the restaurants on their grounds as well as Mariot CasaMagna property next door. I was celebrating a birthday while there and they delivered a bottle of champagne to our room which was a pleasant surprise and very much appreciated. Receiving an email from the property representative prior to the trip as well as a quick response from them to my emails spoke highly of their attempts to make it a pleasant stay which it certainly ended up being. I believe all the rooms are either ocean view or ocean front. I had an ocean view. Tried to get upgraded but even as a Platinum Member they were not able to upgrade me. Room was large but a bit out dated in my opinion compared to other JWs I have stayed in. Regardless the view was spectacular and made up for it completely. Left the balcony door open at night and sound of the ocean was simply amazing. Asked for access to Club 91 even at a cost but was told since the hotel was at capacity they could not even allow me to pay for it which was disappointing. Tips If you want to save a few dollars there are a number of roadside convenient stores within walking distance from hotel for sodas chips sun lotion beer liquor etc. Prices considerably cheaper than hotel gift shop. There are a few restaurants and even a Papa Johns pizza within walking distance as well. Hotel gift shop however does have everything you could possibly want but pricey for everyday items as to be expected. Keep receipts if you think to do so and compare to your folio which they will provide you the night before. Saves you time in case you see a discrepancy which can surely happen at large non all conclusive hotels when you are paying daily for things out of pocket. Airport shuttle service to from hotel was offered for a price by JW. I opted for a private service which was not only cheaper but provided service for just my party. No waiting for other guests. I did not take a local bus but the whole area is safe and buses ran often in front of hotel were inexpensive and could tell they were of decent quality. Ask the concierge or friendly bellmen if you have questions. Taxis were plenty whether obtained by hotel recommend or if flag one down on street in front of hotel. Again overall a great stay and would return again just will not do so at peak holiday season. Next time I would like to be able to sit polside.", "offset": [1499, 1582], "date": "2015-01-20", "cpt": "0", "category": "pool"}, {"id": 2, "uid": "4bf2e4e0-eac9-4569-b480-63550bff30db", "sentence": "Gluten Free at Club 91.

It is limited you will select for instance chicken fish or beef for dinner that is then cooked and presented by the Chef the only choices from the limited buffet are salad fruit but nothing is labeled Gluten Free at the buffet. You will not have desert unles Chef Luis is on duty if so he will make chocolate covered strawberries for you. He will serve you with a smile and your meal will truly be Gluten Free. You will not have soups available no starters no bread no cookies again it is limited but you can get by. The staff at Club 91 are incredible Chef Luis thank you Walter Erika Yelora are all amazing as soon as I entered the room they would go and ask the Chef to make my food. You must realize Club 91 is Not an All Inclusive general choices are very limited portions are small more like a taste of the food the buffet area is very small and limited it would be hard to feed children here I do not think it would work for them at all you are not allowed bring any food to your room you are allowed water or soda but that is all. One thing I was disappointed about was the hotel pools were cool to cold adults pool was cold in the week we were there maybe one or two people used it for a minute or two the main pool was a little better but still not warm even the indoor pool in the spa area was not warm I inquired about this at the Spa and Reception desk as they are advertised as heated.

It is big but not even close to the one at the JW. At the JW you have a very big pool divided by bridges which gives you the impression that it is more than one pool. It also has an adult only pool if you travel with adults. At Casa Magna you have entertainment at the pool area while at the JW there is no such thing it is very relaxing. But if you travel with kids you can make use of the installations of Casa Magna where the kids club is located. The landscape is beautiful.

I ve had the blessing of staying many times on different hotels in CancunIve stayed 3 times at JW Mariots little brother Mariot CasaMagna. stayed here this time thinking that this was going to be better boy I was wrong. My review is bad because THIS IS a 40USD night hotel that even though is good makes you feel like you are in a very nice Holiday Inn. for this price and level this is unacceptable. I stayed on a premier view room the view was lovely and the room was OK but overall not a nice stay. Let me indicate the PROs and CONsPRO Nice hotel amazing location and great views Salt water pool its a nice thing Bell boys are THE ABSOLUTE BEST contrary to most employees this guy do go the extra mile Downstairs gift shop has a pizza place and lots of groceries to buy really convenient. Parking is FREE which is usual in Cancun but many 5 Star hotels do charge for it. CONs UBER expensive wifi free in some areas slow but the high speed one is 24 USD per day NO essential room amenities No coffee brewer No international plugs No DVD player not even to borrow. the TV is a very old version of a flat scren Service its not outstanding as it SHOULD BE Pool service towels and stuff is awful after 630PM they take away the towels EVEN IF YOUR STUFF is on top of them. the take them away pool hours go to 1PM but after 630 you better bring you own towels realy Jacuzi does not really work only 2 hydro massage worked and all the other ones were broke for 400 USD a night hotel this is simply wrong. for this I d rather stay at the Holiday Inn. Our bad experience ended up with us being locked out of the room. Hwy. on the checkout date we went down and had breakfast. 1030ish came up before the 12PM checkput to get our bags and oh surprise we were locked out. our keys did nt work anymore and had to go to call front desk in order for someone to come up and open the door.

My wife Kathy and I spent 6 days at the JW Mariot Cancun from April 12 to 18 2015. It was a special 20th anniversary trip. While we used MR points for the room we upgraded to a beautiful Grand Oceanfront Suite. Our room was 130 sq ft with a large ocean front balcony. The amazing service at the hotel started from the time we arrived with quick attentive personalized service. We were greeted with cool towels to clean our hands at check in. As we arrived at 3 pm and our room was not ready we headed to the Beachwalk Cafe at the pool for a late lunch. During our lunch the reception manager came by with our room key. At lunch we were served by Jorge. He was so friendly making sure we felt welcomed to the JW. We joked about pronunciation of our last name and Jorges name. We saw Jorge several more times during our stay and he continued to be so friendly. Of the six nights we ate 4 at the JW Mariot or neighboring Casa Magna Mariot. Really liked Sa Si Thai and enjoyed Champions. But the most amazing experience was our dinner at Gustino Italian Restaurant. Service and food was impeccable. We also attended an invitation only evening at Campila Argentinian Grill. Most nights we started the evenings with a drink at the beautiful lobby bar. While we spent most days at the pool we also went to La Isla Mall towards the end of most days. Great spot for a mocha frapucino at Starbucks and a bit of shopping.

Having traveled for business and pleasure on numerous occasions and staying in a multitude of hotels for weeks at a time in the past I had consider myself somewhat of a hotel snob. Thus it is surprising how much I enjoyed my time here. I have stayed at the next door Mariot CasaMagna Resort prior to this and already thought highly of the resorts. Coming here for the first time however was like night and day. The property had a far more modern feel to it and the environment felt significantly classier than its next door sister property. The housekeeping staff was excellent providing service twice during the day and leaving little surprises for us during each one. The hotel comes with multiple indoor pools and the adjacent white sand beaches. But honestly who cares about those. The infinity pool at the resort is absolutely amazing that you will not even want to swim in the ocean or in the indoor pool. Word of advice though if you want to use the stuffed beach chairs under the shade definitely claim them by 8 AM with a towel as those do tend to get taken quickly. While people have complained that the crowd in the lobby bar is too old consider this the JW Mariot is intended to be an upscale hotel not the Cosmopolitan in Vegas. It is not meant to be used for that purpose. Instead my way of describing it is a relaxed lounge with live singers performing acoustic versions of old and modern songs and surprisingly reasonably priced drinks given the environment. Sedona grill for breakfast buffet was amazing. breakfast outdoors in a shaded environment overlooking the pool. I had highly encourage purchasing it as part of your room package or even shelling out the cash to pay for it at least once while you are there. You will not regret it.

Excellent Service. We are presently on our fifth day here at the JW Mariot and we all love it. My wife is taking a nap and I thought it would be a good time to share our experience. First the level of service is top notch. EVERYONE has been so pleasant and kind here at the hotel as well as polside and in the restaurants on the property. Could not ask for any friendlier or more helpful staff. Everyone really works hard to make you feel welcome and that is something we very much appreciate. We are staying the first week of June 2016 and the weather is awesome. it is hot but not middle of Summer hot and the refreshing water in the meandering pool is certainly fun to explore as well as keep you at a very comfortable temperature in the heat you expect in Mexico. We enjoy swimming the various parts of the pool and under the bridges that connect the different land segments around the pool. Our favorite spot in the pool is the infinity edge where the pool appears to just merge into the ocean. It is a great place to just hang and enjoy watching the tides rolling in and out. We have sampled several of the restaurants here and all have been very tasty. My son recommends the french fries but I am most partial to the breakfast buffet myself. Excellent service paired with great food is hard to beat. Our best dining experience and surprise was room service. We usually prefer to go out to dine but last night we chose to stay in and ordered room service. We all were so impressed with how the dinner was rolled into the room on a cart that was then transformed into a oval table with places settings and all of the finery of a formal dinner table. I suppose that is what really makes the JW Mariot Cancun stand out so well is the attention to the little details. Of course this may be standard for room service since we rarely use it and are not acquainted with the various methods but we were impressed nonetheless and it certainly was special for us. We love our room on the tenth floor overlooking the pool and ocean. The view is spectacular and we appreciate that the building is situated so that the balconies are shaded in the afternoon and evening which provides a pleasant reprieve from the sun. Our room is spacious and we especially enjoy the large bathroom with both shower and tub. The double sinks and separate water closet add to the luxury of the well appointed bathroom. The one thing that I wish had known before coming here was to bring smaller denomination bills. I tried to break a 100 at the reception desk and was told that I could only get change in pesos. which was not what I wanted. I like to tip in USD. so I know what I am giving. I do not want to short the staff as I can not convert pesos to dollars in my head. I was going to tip someone a 20 peso note and my wife had to remind me it was only a little over 1 USD. Bring lots of 1 and 5 for tipping. The hotel really should be able to provide change for larger bills to smaller bills at the front desk.

This review is really for the couples who are interested in Club 91 and want to know about the key benefits of the club such as the meals rooms and tour assistance. It is important to note that the person writing this review is lifetime Mariot platinum member and has visited very similar properties to this one that had all inclusive floors and many other JW and Mariot properties around the world. If you are a going with children you may have an overall different experience with Club 91. The fact that the club takes families with children changes the overall dynamic of the Club 91 floor to one of a standard Mariot concierge lounge instead of an all inclusive club. Arrival and Check InFirst the arrival and check in experience was nice and if you stay more than 3 days in Club 91 you will get complementary service from the airport. Keep in mind you may be waiting on other Club 91 members to gather their luggage unles you spring for the private transport which we did. The service was fairly quick and well done. On arrival to the hotel we were taken to the Club 91 desk on the Club floor. The Club 91 check in is done right inside the lounge door which we found to be not a personal as we have experienced at another all inclusive Mariot property. During the process you will learn about the benefits of Club 91 and get your schedule of food services for the lounge more about that later. This is also this is the desk and staff that can assist with the hotel services and tours. Once you get your room your luggage with be brought to your room. RomThe room we had was a premium ocean view room with a king bed. It had a balcony which gave us a great view of the ocean and of the pool areas. The bathroom had a good size shower and a tub as well as his and hers sinks. The room had a very comfortable king bed with excellent linens and pillows as well as nice robes and slippers. There was a good amount of closet and drawer space and a desk if you have to do any work. Lounge and FodThe lounge was not as big as I have experienced and was a single room with specific areas for the staff desk buffet for food bar coffee machine and seating. There are a combinations of high top tables 2 person tables and 4 person tables. There are a 3 to 4 4 person tables with the window view of the ocean. There is also a small seating area next to the bar. There are televisions in the lounge and most always are on CN which for those who have been in other Mariot concierge lounges will seem quite normal. The food is served currently around the following schedule\u2022 Breakfast \u2013 7 am to 1030am\u2022. Lunch \u2013 12 pm to 2pm\u2022. Afternoon Tea \u2013 3 pm to 5pm\u2022. Discovery Hour \u2013 6 pm to 750pm\u2022 Open Bar \u2013. 6 pm to 10pm\u2022 Cheese and Pastries \u2013 8 pm to 10pmBreakfast was generally eggs and a few meats as well as a selection of cold cuts oatmeal fresh fruits shakes juices and breakfast breads along with coffee and tea. There was a tasty selection and the fresh shakes were quite delicious. Generally we found the volume of food and seating to be just fine for breakfast. Lunch on the other hand we found to be hit or miss as far as there being food available when you went in. A couple of times we had to ask and in a few minutes a few items would brought out. Lunch was small salads small sandwiches a single soup of some type and chips and salsa. In addition there were cheese and cold cuts as well as a number of small desserts. Lunch was where we first saw the issue of quantity of food arise. At other properties we never had to ask for more food to come out and when new food was brought out it was in quantity that 4 or 5 adults would not immediately consume it. The lunch was tasty and was fine for a break from the beach. Dinner can be another issue. The dinner selection is different each night and is called \u201c Discovery \u201d as it is intended for you to \u201c Discover \u201d the foods from the different restaurants on both the JW and Mariot property next door. For example Monday night is \u201c Champions \u201d night and Tuesday is \u201c Gustino \u201d night. We arrived on Monday and got to the lounge around 7 pm. All we found were a few chicken wings 3 pieces of fish some soup along with the chips and salsa and deserts. We also found next to no seating and the lounge full of small children. We went down to the standard concierge to see what other options for dinner could be found and also expressed our concern with the quality and quantity of food. We were assured it would be better and to please check out the dinner on Tuesday. The next night was the same with a few different foods except there was only one seat under the television and frankly the food just did not improve. We found the dinner food was basically concierge level dinner food at best. For us this meant we had to pay for dinner. We can say that Gustino was excellent and exceeded our expectations. One more thing back to the quantity of food was the evening presentations for Cheese and Petite Pastries which was supposed to occur from 8 pm to 10 pm. A couple of nights I went to the lounge around 830 and found 4 to 5 remaining desserts and a small block of cheese not really what I expected as a presentation. Not exactly what I would have expected for Club 91ToursSo the first thing to know about the tours offered from the Club 91 desk is if you do n\u2019t want to spend all day on a tour you need to go down to the tour desk and get yourself a private car driver and most important tour guide. Then you can go see what you want to see at your pace and be back in time to still enjoy the sun and beach. The Club 91 staff has the standard packages for all day tours OR they can book you a car. We asked for a car with a driver that spoke English and made the assumption the driver not only could speak English but also know a little about where were going Chichen Itza but that was not the case. Bottom line your best tours will be all day unles you book early and get yourself a private tour guide and car or you just rent a car and handle everything yourself. Pools and BeachGreat pools and wonderful beach. Unlike other properties you do NOT have to be in line for an umbrella at 450am as 7 am or even later allowed us to get a nice umbrella and chairs on the adult side with a great ocean view. If you want polside seating then you need to be down before 8 am for the best seats. The bars waiters and staff were great and service excellent. Interesting note there was a nice pool and beachside food menu but no drink menu. You need to come with the cocktails you want and what is in them if there are beyond the standard frozen beach drinks. Towels have to be picked up and there could be line on the kids side early in the morning but it moves fast. One more interesting note about the beach. Most folks as did we would go down and place a towel and bag on the chairs they wanted by 8 am or so. They would then return at their leisure. One our last day we pushed our flights so we could be on the beach all morning. Again I placed our stuff in the chairs on the beach as we had every other day around 745am. When we returned around 845 we were greeted by a sign telling us the entire adult side beach would be closing 11 am to 3 pm for a private party. Now nearly all of the adult pool chairs had been taken to which we complained and were told they were sorry but they had a private party. In other words too bad for you go find what you can find. My advice is ask the front desk if there are any private beach parties scheduled so you know to get a pool chair early. ConclusionThe JW Mariot Cancun is beautiful property with an awesome beach and pool. Club 91 is 150 per night and for that kind of money we expected much better food quantity and quality. Frankly for a lifetime platinum members it should be just included for free or at least discounted to say 50 per night. Unlike the other property we visited that was all inclusive the value and service for a couple just does not seem to be there. Most likely it would be fine for a family with small kids. I would not recommend Club 91 to any couple wanting a level above concierge and no kids as the volume of families with children will create the risk of the same experience I had.", "offset": [7604, 7688], "date": "2017-04-08", "cpt": "1", "category": "pool"}, {"id": 17, "uid": "e1950de9-9a73-49f6-9cac-37b93f5d0623", "sentence": "Great pool and beach issue with view and service. Overall we love the hotel great pool great beach good food comfortable rooms. The issue we had was room type. We booked a suite I have 2 kids and wanted to have enough room and beds for everyone to be comfortable. I paid a premium to get a premium room. We got a premium SIZE room but we got a high discount kind of VIEW. We were on the 3rd floor sounds nice right. Unfortunately the 3rd4th floors of these room types face the BACK OF THE RESTAURANTI was all excited about a premium room with a great view of the beach and ocean and all I could see was the back side of a building. VERY DISAPPOINTED. This is the second time we have stayed here and this is the second time this happened to us. Last time we were a able to move after the first night to a higher room this time they would not move us not upgrade us and did not offer anything to make me happy after I spoke to 2 different people at the front desk. This is NOT the good service I was expecting. I spent a lot of money there I would have expected them to do something to make me happy about the disappointing view. We had other family staying there paid for a discount room and got a fantastic view on the 9th floor. Next time I will pick another hotel that provides a good view when you pay a premium price.", "offset": [0, 49], "date": "2017-07-09", "cpt": "1", "category": "pool"}, {"id": 18, "uid": "79d43670-cf0d-449f-9e6a-21a4dd8f4d09", "sentence": "The JW Mariot Cancun Resort Spa offers a luxurious full service experience. In keeping with the JW line of Mariot hotels the hotel rooms amenities and location make it an exceptional choice for your time in Cancun. The hotel staff members were very friendly and attentive. Nearly all staff members spoke English well so you do not need to worry about brushing up on Spanish. We have a higher tier of Mariot rewards status so we enjoyed the upgraded experience large suite with a view of the ocean extra touches at dinner in their restaurants enhanced Wi Fi snacks and access. We spent our whole time at JW Mariot Cancun Resort Spa or the Casa Magna Mariot next door they are connected. There are several very nice restaurants in the resort as well as some more casual ones. you will find a small pharmacy shopping center jeweler and convenience store on the premises. there is a nice lounge with live music nightly and the resort puts on small activities most evenings ie outdoor movie night. The suite we stayed in had a king sized bed a large bathroom with separate shower and tub two sink vanity and lots of toiletries. The AC in the room works well and cools things down fast. We had a balcony with a view of the resort pools and ocean. The pools are absolutely fantastic infinity edge overlooking the beach. Most pools are connected and offer different features ie Shallow hot tub kids pool steps etc. There are lots of wooden umbrellas and small tables. When you sit down you will get a towel and a server who will bring you anything you want to eat or drink. We went at the end of April so it was not very crowded at all and we enjoyed a lot of privacy. The pools are open late. They provide a lifeguard lots of beach lounges and cabanas. If you want to use a cabana you will have to reserve one. it is easy and they give you some extra perks and upgrades to your service. They have several restaurants in the resort and at the conjoined Mariot. We ate at most of them and were impressed buy the service and quality of food. Some even offered live music. We were very pleased with how clean and tidy everything was. The crowd varied by type elderly young couples families. There were a good number of families and children when we went. we had recommend getting a suite with an ocean viewed eating at Gustinos spending as much time as possible by the pool and eating buffet breakfast at Sedona Grill tons of great options all you can eat. They personalized our experience and made us eager to come back soon.", "offset": [1181, 1240], "date": "2018-05-02", "cpt": "1", "category": "pool"}, {"id": 19, "uid": "6f95367d-cefd-45b2-a97a-11363f70bf5d", "sentence": "This Hotel is Beautiful.
