The one bummer was that as a normal guest without any upgrades you are only allowed to use one of the pools. It was nice but with all 4 pools I would have liked to experience the variety. The food outlets the rock themed decorations and the friendly staff. it is a little ways from the Strip but there is a shuttle. Right by the UNLV campus which makes it a lot quieter and more mellow than the Strip. Maybe allowing guests in at least 2 pools rather than just one.

My wife I are in our early 40s after 20 times visiting Vegas over the last number of years we finally decided to give the Hard Rock a try.

We arrived at the hotel on July 4th around 530 pm there was no line at check in so that made for a good first impression. Check in host was great we asked about an upgrade but were told there were none available no worries we ended up in the casino tower 11th floor corner unit facing the pool. The room was perfect it was clean had lots of space was super quiet we never heard any other guests coming or going during our stay. Only a couple of pools were open during our stay but we did not have any issues finding seats when we arrived both mornings around 11 am. Drink service was great both days our servers were very friendly and easy going. Casino was very quiet during the days but had a great atmosphere in the evenings. Music was awesome tables were busy drink service was good and we did not find anywhere in the hotel casino included to be smokey.

I \u2019m told Hard Rock is soon to close down for 8 months to complete a multi million dollar renovation. It \u2019s definitely time that happened. We always stay right on the strip but wanted a little less busyness this trip to Vegas so we tried Hard Rock for the first time which is a couple blocks off the strip. We checked in on a Thursday and checked out five days later on Tuesday. The check in process was n\u2019t bad for Vegas probably 12 people in front of us taking about 5 minutes or more for each person. We were given a non smoking room on a non smoking floor remember this for later. The first thing we noticed walking through the casino to the elevators was the place was almost empty. There were very few people gambling and one entire side of the casino tables were closed. This did not change during the five days we were there regardless of the time dayor night when we walked through creating a low energy boring feel. The only crowds of people we saw were there for concerts and a Halloween ball. Once in our room at the very back of the property the first thing noticed was how dark it was due to everything being black. the furniture the carpet the bathroom the granite sinks. This coupled with very dim lights made it difficult to see when trying to get ready put makeup on etc. After unpacking our bags we decided to grab some lunch at Pink Taco a restaurant on the property. This was probably the highlight of our Hard Rock stay since the food service and value were all great. We ended up eating here again a couple days later and again had a great experience. We then headed out for the evening and did not return until 10 PMUpon entering our room all we could smell was the smell of someone smoking marijuana. We soon learned our neighbors in the next room were having a pre night out party. I called and spoke with guest services requesting to move to a different room and was transferred to the front desk where the phone rang for 45 minutes with no answer before I finally gave up and made the long walk downstairs to the front desk. Arriving at the front desk I noticed there were only three desk agents and 17 people in line waiting to check in. Realizing this would be another 45 minute wait I aborted and went back to my room. By the time I got back the neighbors next door had left for their evening of partying. The next morning we had to leave before 70 AM for an engagement and did not return until later that evening so we had no opportunity to speak with management about changing rooms before our dinner reservations at MB Steak there on the property. MB Steak was a good experience so we were in a great mood until we returned to our room later that evening only to find our neighbors next door once again smoking pot and partying. They soon left but then the entire floor including our room started smelling like cigarette smoke. We were on a non smoking floor but evidently some of the people in other rooms did not adhere to that rule forcing everyone else on the floor to deal with their cigarette smoke. The smoke smell was not only coming in the room under the door but also coming in through the vent in the bathroom. We had to put a bath towel on the floor by the entry door and keep the bathroom door closed with the fan running in order to help dissipate the smell of smoke. I called and spoke with someone at the front desk and they assured me that should housekeeping determine that anyone on the non smoking floor was smoking they would be charged a 149 cleaning fee. This did me absolutely no good because the next three nights the cigarette smoking on my floor continued. The same person informed me that marijuana was not allowed on the property and that security would address it if they knew about it. Again did me no good. The following day we left early again for the day only to return that night to find our room exactly the way we left it that morning \u2014 unmade bed and dirty towels on the floor. Housekeeping missed cleaning our room that day. A call to the front desk got us clean towels delivered to our room and the removal of the almost 40 daily resort fee for that day but only confirmed our feelings up to this point that we made a HUGE mistake staying here in the first place. Our final night we stayed in and ate at CraftComunity Bar and Grill on the property. There was only one other couple eating in the restaurant and 2 or 3 people at the bar at 80PM which initially concerned us that maybe it was not going to be good. Luckily we were wrong and it was a great meal.
