This was a very nice Sheraton. I stay in a lot of Starwods and this Sheraton was at the top level seemed more like a Westin. Trendy lobby and decorations. Staff was very nice. Especially the housekeeping staff. Conference facilities were also good as well as the conference food. My only issue was that the bartenders in the lobby seemed a little aggressive. I paid 60 cash for three drinks had about 15 coming back in change. Within 5 min the bartender took it all as their tip. I was surprised. Generally you do not see that in a place like this. I will come back again because everything else was great but I will be a little more observant of my change in the lobby bar next time.", "offset": [304, 372], "date": "2015-03-06", "cpt": "0", "category": "venue"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "e7476c6c-748e-4795-9d27-6d619901ade7", "sentence": "Clean and lovely. I was at a convention and rarely stay in a Sheraton so this was a new experience. The hotel is spotless everywhere. Loved the person who did my room every day. My only regret is that they do not provide information on hotel amenities. I was leaving when I saw their area for take out coffee tea etc. The room was lovely and really up to date.

I had an wonderful visit to Phoenix and enjoyed my stay at the downtown Sheraton Hotel. The hotel was clean and nice and just what I expected but this is not all that made my stay wonderful. It was their staff. From the restaurant waitress manager bartenders front desk valets and lounge servers that is what made the stay great. They were friendly helpful attentive and just nice. They acknowledged my needs or just asked if I needed assistance. Shared their personalities and made me feel comfortable. This is a good choice to anyone whether you are with a convention or just wanting to visit Phoenix. I highly recommend this is where you choose to stay.

I stayed here for a conference. The room was clean and comfortable. Very nice for the price. The only issue I had was with the TV constantly losing signal. The hotel sent someone promptly to work on it but he could not fix it. It made watching all but a handful of channels impossible. However it is a TV at a hotel so not a big deal in my book. I was really happy with the conference facilities here. I ate breakfast in the cafe one morning and it was really good.

Listen if you are looking for a resort style hotel to relax and vacation at this may not be the best option. The pool is very small because it is located downtown in a metro area and the only option was placing it on the rooftop. I personally thought this was great for a business convention.

Just ugly as hell for the rate of 209 per night. The manager said all Sheraton hotels are being remodeled this way so this will be my last Sheraton stay as a status Bonvoy member.
