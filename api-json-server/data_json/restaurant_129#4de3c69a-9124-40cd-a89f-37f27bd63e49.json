We were pleasantly surprised with our one night stay at the Courtyard. As a Mariot member we stay at their properties when we can and this property was well maintained and the room was nice appointed. The check in desk was nice and they gave additional information about the hotel about the use of the pool and restaurant. As a Platinum member they did not charge us the resort fee. it is very convenient to the airport about 15 minutes and close to many restaurants shops. The only downside is that while it is right on the beach the beach itself is not very usable with lots of rocks so swimming is not advised. We ate at the restaurant and it was good even at this late hour after arriving.

Fabulous hotel where they treat you like Ohana family from checkin to check out. Turn right out of the airport go 7 miles driveway on right after coconut beach shopping and Long drugs. This hotel has an amazing staff they will do anything for you. You pay a 20 resort fee but it is so worth it if you are going around the island to various beaches which you should. it covers beach chairs mat towels mini cooler etc. it is awesome So you do not have to buy stuff you can not take home. Oh did I say you get free Mai Tais at the bar included in the fee. There is a game room pool bar restaurant fitness area hammocks Adirondack chairs lounge chairs and beach and walking path The breakfast buffet is fabulous from eggs Benedict pancakes local fruit omelet station etc etc etc. Deb is a wonderful hostess and Harry a fabulous waiter. Who totally took care of my mom who he honored her with by calling her aunty. The man who played guitar and sang at the bar on Friday night was fabulous. Thank you for playing our song requests. Ashley our waitress and her helper guy were outstanding. The pupus appetizers and chocolate cake were out of this world. Leilani at the front desk at check in treated us like family from our arrival. She found out it was my moms 75th birthday and she was here for Kauai High School reunion and went out of her way to walk over to where my mom was sitting to great her and give her a lei. Way above and beyond and we are gold members of Mariot and Hilton and its the best service I have had in yearsColen at the checkout was great too. Now the bellhops. Pablo Leo and Ryan were there to help all my family with bags valet parking and questions. Theses boys were fabulous young men.

We used the bike rentals twice on our stay and loved the easy access to the oceanside bike trail which passes through old town Kapa heading northbound and then ends at Lydgate Park on the south end. The yoga class itself would cost around 20 state side in a big city and I was able to attend twice during this trip. The hotel is currently still being renovated so there was some construction noise going on which we only noticed on our last day as we were packing and getting ready to check out. Started around 9 am. We did n\u2019t spend any time during the day in our hotel since we were out and about in Kauai. But if you just wanted to lounge by the pool area the noise would probably be very annoying. The pool itself seemed nicely maintained and there were always people that looked like they were enjoying themselves but we did not use it ourselves again. why go to Kauai and just sit by the polAnyway it is located in a great spot in Kapa. Easy access to go either north towards Princevile Hanalei or south to Poipu so we never spent more than 40 minutes driving to get to our destination.
