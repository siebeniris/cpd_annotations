Stayed at this hotel for 3 weeks all I can say is amazing. The service was very nice the room was very good and clean. The location is perfect. The view sea side was amazing. many evenings and mornings spent in the balcony enjoying this view. Every morning there was a very green iguana sunbathing in the palm trees just underneath our balcony. will upload pictures later. The hotel has a spacious and modern lobby nice restaurant with excellent seafood. there is a shopping area on the property with lots of nice shops including an excellent watch store. The main attraction is the Infinity pool that gives you the feeling of swimming right out to the open ocean. It was always heated which I loved. Pool bar was very nice and the service once again very good. The only thing I might have a gripe with is the noisy and sometimes smelly casino next to the hotel. But once you are in the room you would not notice it. Just one warning do not book an indoor view room.

I stayed here at the end of August for 3 nights. We had booked a room at a competetive rate so finally I took the opportunity to stay here. Because of the low rate we were give an inside room meaning no day light. The room is connected to the big conference hall. Windows can be closed with curtains which we did 247. For those few nights it was not really an issue. Thankfully no conference took place at the time. I would not suggest staying in this kind of room for a longer time or if there was a conference going on. The room itself is spacious and has comfy beds. Nice bathroom but there were some hooks missing. it is nice to hang your clothing somewhere while showering. Pressure in the shower is not that great. The hotel has a nice infinity pool with an articifical beach. Although it does not feel that way. It also has a small pool. Definitely worth spending some hours swimming and tanning there. I love the interior of the lobby and the restaurant. All so colorful and bright. We had the Sunday brunch and that is really worthwhile trying out. It is in buffet style.

We arrived at hotel to be told or rooms were not together no apology or effort to correct this situation was offered just an attitude about the matter. Room service closes early. 11 pm. One night one member of our group had a stomach ache and room service told her to go to the bar for a Sprite because they were closed no empathy no offer to help. Rooms were not cleaned one day at all Another day it took the two hours to delivery breakfast. No apologies were offered until check out which gave me the opinion they were only doing it to avoid a bad review.

Very good is subjective here. My VERY GOOD rating is based upon a few things its very good relative to the other locations we saw on the island. It is very good as there were a few helpful and friendly staff at the front desk that after the first night welcomed us like long lost friends. It is very good as there is a decent starbucks in the middle of the hotel. It is very good as the beach towels were nice quality we always found chairs and overall this location was central and you could walk to most things quite easily. It is only GOOD as the beach is rather a fake beach with a sand bottom endless looking pool that overlooked the real beach that is a rocky unusable shoreline. Great place to watch the boats come in and out of the harbor though. The Renaissance is only good as it is like a fancy Holiday Inn which is fine but for me with this location there is room for improvement. It is BARELY Good because you must know this is the first hotel by the dock that the cruise ships dock beside. It is the hotel that has the Casino that is advertised to these cruisers. The shops along the hotel are focused on the cruise ship patrons so really no local or real shopping is by this hotel. This also makes for many people around the hotel area that are not staying at the hotel and a number of times there were cruise people on the small beach. It is barely good becasue somewhere at the hotel is supposed to be decent food and we only found mediocre one night at best and the rest was not marketed well enough for us to even seek out the restaurant. It is barely good because even though I am not a casino person I have been around my share and this is a small basic clean casino. No big deal. It is barely good because we are lifetime members of this chain of hotels and there was nothing done that made us feel that had any influence at all on our stay. There is no concierge floor or lounge no extra services. It is barely good as I am assuming there are two views at this hotel beach ocean and not much of a view. Our room that was an upgrade after we complained about our first oceanview room that basically overlooked the open air strip mall below and then the ocean and cruise ship dock to another ocean view room on 4th floor that now we overlooked the open air strip mall below to see through the palm tree tops to the manmade beach to the ocean a better view but as previous reviews have mentioned get a top floor centrally located ocean view or you will have cruise ship or roof top skimmed ocean views. We were there during their holiday season and because of the mall area below us there was never much quiet here. Be forwarned. It gets kinda quiet after 11 and is barely quiet here and there during the day. Like a constant white noise and other times loud music at the establishment below. People overall friendly and helpful. We would stay again just out of convenience and because some things were very good and we did get some time in the sun.", "offset": [759, 896], "date": "2017-01-13", "cpt": "1", "category": "room"}, {"id": 11, "uid": "8a805891-494a-481f-86fe-20a818da587d", "sentence": "Great Place to Stay and Visit. We recently returned from a weeks stay at the Renaissance. When we arrived they could not have been any nicer. The manager offered us a drink while they checked us in. We had reservations for 3 rooms which had been upgraded due to our lifetime platinum elite status but what we did not know and they were so excited to share with us is that one of our rooms was a beautiful suite on the top floor. It was perfect and we were grateful. We were able to have breakfast delivered each morning and have all of us sit and enjoy the meal together. At night we congregated and played cards or simply read a book on the balcony. Great hotel beach where you can relax have lunch and swim. We also made friends with Alvin who works at the hotel. If you ever meet him you will understand. Terrific guy. The front desk and concierge were so nice and very helpful to us. The hotel is situated near the floating bridge so we walked over and enjoyed delicious meals at Perla Del Mar Dal Toro and Scampi. s. Close to the hotel is Xquisit which is the hotels restaurant Steak and Ribs and Ristorante di Zabia all located in the fort which are steps from the hotel. Most of them were on the water and the meals were outstanding and the service was terrific. I have read reviews about the slow service but what is the rush. We were able to enjoy our family a great meal and great food. We did two excursions that I booked through Viator. Both picked us up at the hotel which was convenient. The first was with Bounty Adventure and it was Curacao Half Day Snorkel and Lunch. The crew was fantastic and the lunch too. We all had a blast. The second excursion was Best of the West Tour of Curacao through Serenity Transfers and Tours and we also used them for airport pick up and drop off. We stopped and saw flamingos went on a short hike we literally swam with the turtles at a beach we had a stop at another beach with a boxed lunch and then the last stop was a plantation house. Hety our tour guide was very informative and just loved her. We visited the Curacao Liqueur Distillery and went to the Chill Beach Bar for some drinks and lunch which is located on Mambo Beach.

We had an unfortunate experience with our very first time ever using the babysitting services via the hotel and she went above and beyond to correct the experience. The kids got icecream sent to the room and we got a beautiful fruit platter delivered as well. it was really nice.

She even surprised us with a slice of cake and cookies as advance birthday greeting eventhough my birthday is not until the end of NEXT month. but we very much enjoyed it nonetheless hahahaEverywhere you turn there is smiles and they mostly seem genuine. We had the coolest waiter twice Wawo hope I spelled it right. who made instant friends with my sons. He was a great help to me when we had the buffet dinner at nautilus and I was alone with the 2 kids. Thank youThe Chef at dinner by Nautilus is also super nice made my oldest feel very special. Really everyone was great to us there the breakfast buffet waitresses all were amazing making sure we got our coffee start of the dayThe housekeeping ladies for the evening turn down service would leave extra chocolates for the kids on their pillows needless to say they looked forward to going to the room at night to find that treasure. If we had run into them in the hallway they would also give them chocolates. Really sweet ladies. The location of this place is impeccable. you have the rif fort as your back yard shops galore steps away from Otrabanda and the connecting bridge to Punda. You really can not beat the location. Nice parking garage the pool and manmade beach are beautiful and the views while lounging in the water is amazing. Really have absolutely nothing negative to say about this gem of a hotel. Would highly recommend it. no doubtThe splash pad unfortunately was not working during the week we were there and got fixed the last day we were leaving. but that is minor. there is a public playground steps away from the hotel in Otrabanda on the plain.
