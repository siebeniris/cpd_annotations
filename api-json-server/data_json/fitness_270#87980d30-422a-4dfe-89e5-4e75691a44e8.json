The icing on the cake the Roof Top your own private roof top where you have views of the most iconic buildings in the world. And as a guest you are welcome up there when ever your heart desires.

I was pleasantly surprised from an extremely swift checkin to the way my request for a room transfer was handled The Shelburne delivered. My room was large by NY standards it had lots of storage space a spacious bathroom a fridge and also a small sitting area. Even though it faced Lexington Ave it was quiet enough for a light sleeper like me. Air condition was quiet and efficient. Contrary to what other reviewers have reported wifi was free and worked well. Cleaning housekeeping was somewhat uneven however some days impeccable other days they had forgotten to empty waste baskets and just barely wiped off surfaces. The fitness room is located on the second floor and is relatively big by hotel standards. Here is room for improvement they could easily fit more weight lifting equipment in there as it is now it is very limited. The fitness room too could do with better cleaning. I did not try the restaurant on the ground floor nor the afternoon wine hour. Checkout was as smooth and swift as checkin had been. All in all I had a very pleasant stay at the Shelburne.

I am a New Yorker that lives in London now and I have been staying at the Shelburne for almost 20 years. It was an apartment hotel when I first stayed there offering a kitchenette in many of its room. they have modernized in recent years and that is no longer available. Although some of the suites have a kitchen area with microwave small fridge kettle crockery and cutlery which is great if you are there for a long stay. The hotel is very trendy now with nice decor in the rooms. Beds are big and comfortable with choice of pillow type. All rooms have a small fridge. Bathrooms are nice and clean and prettier than they used to be. The only thing I wish they had not changed was the small toiletries they offered. They were good quality but now they have pump dispensers in the showers which are not as good. Any issues with your room are resolved asap. The employees are extremely friendly and helpful and there is pretty much nothing they would not do to make you feel at home. Some of the employees have been there for as long as I have been going there. I think that speaks volumes for the management. Room service is good. The Shelburne has a great burger restaurant called RARE on site and have an amazing outdoor bar lounge on the roof which is very popular especially with young city professionals. there is a small gym that is got most of what you need for a decent workout during your stay. Running machines stair masters bikes weights mats water towels and TV. Another criticism is that I have not been happy in the last few years that they charge for wifi daily. Movies are also expensive but I think that is the same in many of the better hotels. it is not an inexpensive hotel although you can get some pretty good deals at various times during the year. The location is Murray Hill which is a great neighborhood.

Quick read. the rooms are nice enough but the hotel fails in key ways hidden fees for worthless amenities rude front desk staff even for New York spotty wireless continual efforts to upcharge you. In full It saddens me to give the Shelburne one star. I have stayed here before and I was really looking forward to my return. What a difference a year makes. The hotel has good bones and the rooms are nice depending on what you get it is a lot of space for New York and some parts of the hotel are very quiet too. But I should have been tipped off by all the emails from Afinia asking me to select various extras for a fee. The most galling was being asked to pay 10 night to be on a higher floor. I did not. that is when it hit me this place is now like an airline. Yeah you bought the seat but that is it. Bags. Fee. Overhead space. Fee. Food. Fee. As others have mentioned there is now a 25 tax. DAILY facility fee which gets you a bunch of stuff that should have been included anyway like the fitness room or stuff you do not want like up to 10 worth of junk food in the hotels lobby. Yes they also sell bad wine and beer and water. It also pays for your opportunity to sit in the cramped lobby swilling more cheap wine at a very unhappy hour with a bunch of European alcoholics and assorted tipsy 20somethings. Total ripof. The facility fee was defensively explained at checkin and I was assured that I must already be aware of this because it is included in the rate I already signed up for. Well. no not really. I received a few receipts from Afinia and the Shelburne on booking because I changed my reservation. I went back and looked. it is mentioned in some of them but not in all of them. It can be easy to miss and judging from the many unhappy visitors I overheard during my stay a lot of people missed it. Oh and it also includes your free wireless which is not free because you are paying 25 day for it. And that wireless is not very good. it is meant for light surfing and email. Ok who does that anymore. People watch videos. They listen to music. They do these things simultaneously. Hotels need to have good wireless that does not glitch out regularly. The hotel is now sufficiently downscale that I smelled people smoking weed in their rooms and felt a little unsafe walking by certain patrons who were clearly more suited for a Days Inn. Not to be a snob but that was not what I was paying for. Finally the staff. Some of them are fine some of them are rude all are ineffectual.

My husband and I chose this hotel for our first trip to NYC together because we had both stayed here in our former lives and liked it. However that was 20 and 30 years ago and a lot can change in that time. Happily I found it was still a hotel and actually well reviewed so I booked it. The Murray Hill area in which it is located in the mid east side does not have many hotels and has a nice non touristy almost upper middle locals type feel. it is convenient to Broadway although more so for walkers as cabs do not seem to traverse east to west easily. The lobby and common areas have a nice contemporary elegence. Check in was fine room was not ready but it was before 3. We had something else to do in the area and were checked in promptly at 3 without a problem. The room was small to moderate. and my only disappointment about that was that this hotel and the others in this little chain to the best of my recollection used to offer huge suites at moderate prices. That was an obscene value however to be honest I think I may have been in a frequent guest program in those days and the current room was still large enough to easily navigate with a king size bed in it. Bathroom was similarly small medium all pretty standard for NYC to my mind. Decor was understated view was of a rooftop garden in the next building not unpleasant. Room was clean. Only negative was no towels. That was rectified about a half hour after a call. We did not eat at the restaurant there but I do like the increasing availability of munchies for purchase in hotel lobbies which this hotel has. A bit pricey for what you get but convenient. We liked the rooftop bar my only niggle about that is its being commandeered by a lot of large after work parties relegating us to a small patch near the waiting station. Perhaps they could open it an hour earlier for guests on vacation. There is also a wine happy hour in the lobby which we did not take advantage of but looked nice. Lobby also has a couple of working computers a printer and helpful concierges. Although I usually exercise on vacation for some reason I never get a workout in in NYC perhaps because there is always so much else to do. Nevertheless I briefly checked out the fitness center which seems decent with a few treadmills bikes weights and an exercise ball. Many must do as I do as there was one lone person on a bike. Staff was generally five star friendly and professional. Kudos to housekeeping my pet peeve is places where no one comes until 430 PM. Here the housekeeper seemed to be constantly on the floor in the morning and asked me as I headed to the elevator if we wanted our room made up now. I do not think I have ever experienced that in all my years of traveling. The only other challenge I would bring up is to have a few more staff in the late morning for checkout. I came to the front desk to check out and someone cut in front of me for a somewhat complicated checkout and what seemed like 10 minutes of questions. Finally someone else showed up to take care of me. We were not yet in danger of missing our train but it was a tad off putting. Value wise despite not quite the knock it out of the park experience from my distant past I still do think it is a relative bargain. an upscale feel at a moderate priceThis place almost makes it to 5 stars for me43.

My Fiance who was also in the reservation arrived early Valeted the car and left her card for incidentals. On the card statement she was charge with 2 charges for Valet Even though my Bill at check out was empty of any charges. We called several times and They still have yet to reverse the charge or even give us a courtesy call. Two charges when it was clearly a package of room and parking. They just do not care about their guests. I can say this with confidence because if you see their elevators which are not only the slowest elevators in history they are the size of a phone booth scary and create noises that are quite eerie but there is no air condition in them. So as you are taking a 15 minute ride to get from the 14 th floor down you will probably lose 5 lbs and come out drenched with sweat. What tops this off even better. The Hall ways are not air conditioned either. So skip the gym there is a sauna in the hotel. Do not fall for the extras they charge you as this hotels prides itself on deception and taking advantage of tourists. I Paid an extra 200 for a high floor. I had a lovely view of a soot stained brick wall. I am filling a dispute with my credit card as they are unwilling to care about a guest who paid for a package of parking and room which was clearly on the check out receipt and they still are charging over 700 for parking and do not have the courtesy of giving a call or attempting to find out why this happened.
