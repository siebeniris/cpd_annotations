I discovered this resort from a co worker and the fact that we love to drink wine it was worth looking into. I saw the photos on the site and immediately thought it was beautiful. I continued to research and discovered the Girls Gone Wine Package. I emailed the resort and Amanda Gordon handled all of the reservations and any issues or concerns. The package included one night stay 80 min massage lunch and a wine tour tasting. We arrived Fri Jun 12 to the beautiful Resort and were immediately greeted by 5 bellmen. They unloaded our luggage and we proceeded to check in. Corine was the front desk mgr. and she informed us that the Villa we were staying at was off property and that we would either have to drive or utilize their shuttle service. We inquired about the pool access at the Villa and she informed us we would be required to come back to the Resort this is the only pool we can utilize. We were never informed of this nor does their website provide those details. So the bellmen had to re load our luggage and were told that there would be no bellmen service at the Villa to help unload our vehicle. Once we arrived at our Villa I thought it was very nice and clean. Some of the outlets did not work but we discovered the break box and resolved it. The Villa was the perfect size for 4 women and all of our products and luggage to sleep comfortably. I contacted Corine to express our concerns due to the inconvenience of having to shuttle to the Resort for every activity we had planned and the fact that we could not utilize the Golf course pool area. She promptly apologized and provided comps to our trip for our frustrations and for not being properly informed of our stay. We graciously accepted those comps to the buffet and 2 bottles from the winery. We visited the pool Fri night and came back for dinner. Kevin the evening mgr met us at the buffet to make sure we knew he was aware of our issues and explained he was there to make sure the remaining of our stay was taken care of. He contacted us the next night and continued to make sure we were happy. He was awesome. The Spa and masseurs Lee Joseph and Monique were awesome. Our luncheon was wonderful more selection would be nice. The Wine tour tasting was very interesting and fun. We learned the proper way to sample wine and the castle was beautiful. To end the celebration on Sat night we dined at the Cafe Elan. It was nice more selection would have been great due to we are from Ms and like to eat. Neli our server ROCKED. She handled 4 women and their demands with a professional but fun manner. Kudos to herLastly Jake Jefferson and Jacob were our continued access and fun shuttle drivers. They made the stay worth it. They took photos for us and made sure we were never waiting for a RIDE. Please let them see our review. Overall the stay was short and sweet. The birthday girl was taken care of and she was happy in the end. Corine Kevin and the entire staff in my review took what could have been a negative situation and turned it into a positive one very quickly. I do recommend if you are planning to visit this Resort to stay at the Spa. I do not recommend the Resort for the younger crowd such as ourselves and do your research of the menus before booking and understand all of the rules before staying at the Villas.", "offset": [2217, 2273], "date": "2015-06-16", "cpt": "0", "category": "venue"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "bf3dad1f-108f-44e7-8caa-59ee66d6609b", "sentence": "STAY SOMEWHERE ELSE.

Nothing in the fridge the bed sheets felt crusty and just because castle is in the name DO NOT THINK YOU ARE STAYING SOMEWHERE NICE. Front desk service was HORRIBLE. The staff was very rude and uninformed about the event I was there for. The elevators will give you a panics attack. They take about 5 min to go 1 FLOOR. Food is blah not worth the price.

My family and I have been coming to the Chateau for years. We come several times a year and every Thanksgiving for the past 5 years. This year for the first time we invited extended family. Although they do n\u2019t like to travel we convinced them that the Thanksgiving buffet we always do the Thanksgiving overnight package that included the buffet was to die for and a must seUnfortunately the new owners have heralded in a new era of mediocrity at this once charming and lovely hotel. I was SO embarrassed for convincing our guests that they should come here for this incredible buffet and unique European hospitality. The only thing incredible about our entire stay was how shockingly fast this once great getaway did a complete 180 in every way from its appearance to its food to its management and everything in between. Their Thanksgiving buffet used to be the talk of the town. Worth every cent of its 80 price tag 2 tickets included per room if you stay with the Thanksgiving package. This year however there was a MARKED difference in the quality and the presentation. A select few dishes were superb the sweet potato pot de creme the Brusel sprouts au gratin the leeks with mushrooms and the whipped mashed potatoes. The crab legs were highly disappointing much smaller than in years past every dessert was either abysmal mediocre or tasteless the stuffing was dry meaty and horrendous the turkey was dry gravy was awful. The bread station was the best part. Apart from the food the ambience has gone completely downhill as well. They stuck the pianist in a back corner under the staircase where you could barely hear her. She used to be near the buffet table where all the guests could enjoy the music and could watch her play. They also did away with the lovely ice sculptures that added so much beauty to the decor. If I had never been to their Thanksgiving buffet before I would say it was good but far from great. Having been to it several times in the past I would say it was sad and disappointing. And I \u2019m not the only one. While on the buffet line I overheard several other guests lamenting the downhill turn it took and my extended family being there for the first time reported back to me that several people on the dessert line were complaining about how wonderful the dessert room used to be in both taste and looks and how mediocre it is now. The bad news did n\u2019t stop there. The breakfast at Versailles the next day was a joke. 23 for a buffet where the food is the same quality as a cafeteria. It was shameful. Later that day we had one of the worst lunches I \u2019ve ever had at Marc the restaurant at the winery. The night of Thanksgiving we had a late dinner at Paddy \u2019s Irish Pub. Nothing to write home about. As soon as we walked into the hotel we knew it would n\u2019t be the same. The new owners changed the lobby and did away with all its elegance and European charm. Now it looks like the inside of any airport hotel where you stay on a layover. The management mirrors the decline in ambience. We are actually mourning the death of the Chateau Elan that we once knew. The only reason to return would be walking around the nature trails on the property.

We enjoyed the Cherokee rose \u2019 and the velvet red. And the port is lovely.

Attention golf and wine aficionados There \u2019s a resort about 40 miles northeast of Atlanta GA that is a full production winery with 45 holes of resort style golf. With 350 acres of wine and golf it \u2019s sure to keep enthusiasts of both busy. Chateau Elan is a both a luxurious golf resort and winery the first winery of its kind in the region since Prohibition a tennis center equestrian show center conference center European style health spa and residential community. Chateau Elan was founded by Don and Nancy Panoz. The couple met while Don was attending Greenbrier Military Academy. After his tour of duty ended Don studied business at Duquesne University and operated two drug stores in Pittsburgh while Nancy stayed home and attended to the couple \u2019s 5 children. Eventually Don formed Mylan Laboratories which became an innovative leader in the field of pharmaceutical delivery. In 1969 the Panoz family packed up and moved to Ireland and created the Elan Corporation which holds more than 100 world wide patents including the nicotine patch. During visits to the Elan research lab in Gainesville GA the couple gained an affection for Muscadine wine made from the indigenous Muscadine grapes. It seemed only natural that their next endeavor would be to delve into the world of fine wines. By instilling the same discipline and standards that made them highly successful in the pharmaceutical industry Chateau Elan and its award winning vineyards have become the envy of many within the winery world. In addition to an award winning winery \u2013 with hundreds of national and international awards to its credit \u2013 it \u2019s also home to 45 holes of golf. You \u2019l experience everything Georgia golf has to offer serene valley lakes and rolling Georgia hills. The Woodlands is one of two championship 18hole layouts and is considered by many to be the most challenging and scenic of the two. As you play your way around The Woodlands you \u2019l be treated to stunning views of the north Georgia foothills. The course plays around several sparkling lakes and towering trees line the fairways of a few holes. There are plenty of elevation changes so be ready for a few blind shots and the rolling terrain makes for some interesting lies. From the back tees Woodlands plays 6725 yards with a course rating of 731 and a slope of 135. At 635 yards 711132 the Green tees provide most men all the golf they can handle while the ladies will find the Burgundy tees 4850692129 a good test of their abilities. Four sets of tees make the Woodlands course enjoyable for golfers of all abilities. One of the most memorable holes on the course is Number 8 a par 5 that plays 508 yards from the Green tees. Unles you \u2019re a monster off the tee it \u2019s a three shot hole predominantly because of the large lake that fronts the green. The preferred shot off the tee on this dogleg right is down the right side of the fairway and is really your only hope at getting on in two. It also opens up your shot to the fairway on the other side of the lake. Most players will choose to layup in front of the lake which still leaves a minimum of 150 yards slightly downhill to the green. If you \u2019re coming in from the left side as many will do beware of the two large bunkers front left. Amazingly this hole is handicapped 5th hardest. The Chateau Course wanders across 170 acres winding around a lake and two creeks. Thick Bermuda rough borders the fairways and creates the contours that can been seen from the tee. The design is more open than the Woodlands Course and not surprisingly water comes into play on several holes. Eighty seven bunkers have been strategically placed throughout the layout and can hamper what you thought was a great shot. Chateau plays 7030 yards from the back tees with a course rating of 74 and a slope of 137. Those wanting slightly less of a challenge will move up to the White tees 590692124. Ladies will find the course enjoyable from the Burgundy tees 513270120. With four sets of tees everyone can find a suitable yardage. No single hole on the Chateau Course showcases the beauty and challenge of the golf course better than the 14th a narrow dogleg right with tree lined fairways. Adding to the aesthetics is the waterfall on the pond short right of the green. The hole plays 400 yards from the white tees and slightly uphill so it takes two well struck shots to get on in regulation. The lone single bunker back right sees a lot of action from golfers avoiding the water hazard. There \u2019s also a par3 course on property. Holes range in length from 73 \u2013 153 yards for men with water hazards and sand traps in play on several holes. The greens are small so accuracy is at a premium. The 9th hole is the longest and plays almost totally over water with a sand trap in the front left. The course can be walked in less than two hours and is open to the public. Chateau Elan also boasts some pretty impressive practice facilities that are open to the public. Their full length driving range is open during daylight hours. There are plenty of targets to dial in your distances and the Wee Links Practice Facility has a multi tiered pitching station practice bunkers a Bentgras and two TifEagle Bermuda practice greens.

My husband and I are here now for a short getaway. We were looking forward to enjoying all areas of the resort following its recent renovation. We were particularly anticipating trying out Louis House of Bourbon and taking in the beautifully redone space in the evening following dinner. Unfortunately the entire bourbon bar is closed tonight for a private event. There was no mention of this on the hotels website when we booked a week ago. To have such a gorgeous fun main space closed entirely and especially right after the renovation has been celebrated is a drawback for resort guests. While there are other bar options Louis House of Bourbon provides a different kind of atmosphere. Management should rethink this in the future. We feel shortchanged as we will not get to experience. enjoy this space during our stay.", "offset": [304, 379], "date": "2020-01-19", "cpt": "1", "category": "venue"}]}
