What a joke. I have been going to the Seminole casino since it was a bingo hall and had the lotto machines. Was so excited when they got the table games. I have been playing blackjack for 30 plus years and if you would have told me there would be a full casino in Tampa and I was not there at least once a week I would have called you crazy. Hard Rock has ruined that. Overpriced table games some rude staff and now asking for paid parking. Not for me. Shame.
