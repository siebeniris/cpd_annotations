To be honest I never had a favorite. After my recent stay at the Ritz Carlton I now know my favorite. Thank you to Rosa at the front desk for finding me the best room possible for the rate class that I chose. I was blown away with the view. I also told Rosa I was seeking rest and solace and that was delivered because I had the most peaceful three nights ever in a hotel. One of the things I noticed most about the Chicago Ritz Carlton is the complete gratitude expressed by the hotel staff whenever I gave compliments or tips.

I was being scam by the Ritz. We decided to stay here because I have an association meeting near by and this is where they book me. We decided to extend our stay for our anniversary.

Somehow the add on dates was cancel and the lady told my husband that it would cost him 3 times more for one night if he still want the additional night. I call back because I am upset that it was not our fault for the price increase. then they told me that they were actually sold out that Saturday night. and it is not even possible. so they have to book our last night in another hotel. I comply because she assured me that there was absolutely no other room. I agreed. still no email confirmation call back the next day. they forgot to book our in between night but have availability on the last night. ask very nicely to have it corrected. They can correct but one of the night they still have price increase. Ok I ask them to reboked. now the lady just sent me 2 separate booking numbers with no attachments call back the next day. still they got the reservation wrong. I demand a manager since the manager was in a meeting the last time. Somehow within 5 min everything was easily fix. no sold out. no price increase.

The hotel is undergoing a complete renovation with some bizarre results. in the room the decor can best be described as minimalist bachelor pad from the 80s. The most egregious example is a massive mirrored sliding door for the bathroom that had sagged and was running into the floor so that the door could only be closed halfway. I did not report this because I would have had to change rooms the door weighs over a hundred pounds and this would not be a ten minute fix. I have always enjoyed taking a bath after a long run in the Ritzs full size bathtubs. Well the renovation has left me with a mini tub much shorter than standard and so no baths. If you install a bathtub make it full size otherwise just delete it. Finally they removed the privacy door to the toilet so if there are two in the room taking a dump has to be done in full view of the other occupant therefore only one person can use the bathroom at a time.
