I heard removal happening mid morning. This was okay by me and by then I had added to the mess maybe the place was operating short handed because of the winter storm warning in effect.

Room Service When finally in contact I decided against ordering because it would have been just impossible for anyone in a kitchen to simply improvise a bit and. top a couple scoops of vanilla ice cream with a few spoonfuls of chocolate sauce let alone toss on a sprinkle or two of any kind of nuts or even granola or any edible crunchy makeshift topping at all despite the presence of bars and restaurants on the premises serving all standard meals and many innovative snacks. So I would have paid top dollar plus a generous tip for any such frozen treat had anyone in food service found a way to flex enough to fix a silly sundae that snowy Saturday night but instead I hopped the elevator down to the convenience shop freezer and bought ice cream bars.

Check in was fast and easy we were given a corner room with a lovely view away from the elevators. After dropping our bags we headed out. I did lower the thermostat before we left as the room was quite warm which we attributed to the large windows and sunny day. Unfortunately when we returned several hours later the room was still very warm. We could not get the AC to kick in. It was after midnight we were tired really did not want to move to a different room so I called the front desk to request a fan. The phone rang a long time before someone answered but the fan was delivered promptly. It should have been cleaned off first as it was very dirty but I wiped it down with damp TP so as not to soil the hotel towels. The fan helped not a lot but enough. It was after 2 am when we finally retired but since check out was noon we thought. no problem we can sleep in a bit. Unfortunately housekeeping banged on our door at 830 am and did not stop til we opened the door. We were unable to get back to sleep after that so we ended up packing up and heading out earlier than we intended.

The bathroom had 14 short hairs from the last guest in the tub and a few more on the floor along the tubs edge. Fourteen plus the ones outside are a bit much. The bathroom light switch appeared clean but next to it the outlet was surrounded by oily fingerprints. I checked to make sure it was not something permanent came right off. There was dust all over the magnifying mirror and shelves. The room just needed one really good spring cleaning dusting and then constant upkeep year round. The shuttle was the most frustrating part of my stay. I have used many different shuttles in many different hotels across many states but this one was the most unreliable. I was told by Shawn a supervisor that when I arrived at the airport to call when I had my luggage and a shuttle would be sent. that is fairly standard. He emphasized that there was no need to reserve the shuttle in advance and after I asked if there was anything else I needed to know he said no. When my flight finally arrived after two days full of delays I had to fight with very poor reception in the airport but finally got through to the hotel only to learn that there was no shuttle available. This was just after 7 pm. They said they could not spare a driver as drivers were needed for other roles at the hotel. They told me to walk to door 7 at the airport and get one of the yellow taxis there. They assured me that they the hotel would pay for the cab and that the yellow taxis knew the procedure. I went out to that door and there were 5 vehicles taxis Lyft Uber waiting for passengers. None of them were the yellow taxis. So I waited. Luckily one of those taxi drivers gave me the rest of the information I needed. I needed to call Union Cab. This time I stood outside for the reception. It took Union a while to arrive but they did come. The hotel paid. Halfway through my almost weeklong stay I had booked a rental car for one day. This was partly why I booked this hotel for the supposed ease of getting to and from the airport via shuttle. I needed to pick up my rental car from the airport and drop it off the same day and get back to the hotel. I called the front desk the night before I needed the shuttle to see if I would have better luck this time. I needed to be to the airport by 830am. I was transferred from the front desk to the valet. I was told I had the options of 715am or a time that is after 830am. 715am was the best they can do. Yep. Other shuttles were booked for other things. But I thought we do not reserve in advance. It sounds like you can reserve in advance to depart from the hotel but not for returning to the hotel. Then I asked about my return time at 8 pm at night. I was told to call at that time and they had see if there was availability at that time. A party had booked the shuttle from 8 pm to 9 pm. He said there might be a shuttle at 745pm and then corrected himself that it was an outgoing shuttle not an incoming one. So that 745pm shuttle might be available for me the next night but since it can not be reserved for pick up who knows. At least this time I know about the taxis although they only pay for those if there is no shuttle service available. FYI. There is hot water available in the lobby. it is in the hotels market area. I was told at first that everything in the market area was for purchase ONLY even after I motioned to the coffee and hot water area. I called the front desk again tonight to be sure that was the case and specifically asked about hot water this time. Yes it is free. Where is it located. In the market area. Sigh. The hotels not all bad. The check in was very professionally handled and when my flight was delayed an entire day they were willing to let me out of my 3rd party reservation to book 1 fewer nights. The new rate was higher than my previous one but it still beat paying for a night I could not use.", "offset": [40, 151], "date": "2020-01-16", "cpt": "1", "category": "room"}]}
