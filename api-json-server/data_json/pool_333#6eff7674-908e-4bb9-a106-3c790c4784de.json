The service outside from the valets was very good and they all had great personalities. Once you walk inside there is a long hall and tall grand ceilings and doors. Lots of lounging space in the lobby and it is very nice clean and appealing to the eye. Once we checked in my husband gave the young lady at the counter his credit card and they gave us room keys and we went on our merry way. We got a call moments later that his card did not go through which puzzled us because we knew the card had money turns out it was that he had not activated his new card. That just made me wonder why they did not catch that before we got up to the 14th floor and he had to go back to the lobby. We stayed for a family reunion and took our 4 year old and I am 9 months pregnant. We enjoyed our stay the hotel was quiet we were not harassed by the housekeepers like some other hotels we have been to. The pool and gym area were available to us. The pool closes at 11 pm and we took some of the kids from the reunion down to enjoy. The pool area was not what I thought it would be. It was not as grand as the hotel at all. The hot tub was filled with young adults I am assuming not sure of their ages blasting music and they had a table full of alcohol complete with big glass bottles and everything in between to mix their drinks. Despite the sub par conditions of the pool we made the best of it. The morning that we were supposed to check out we realized that we had no water in the bathroom. We called downstairs to inform them and were told that it was out from like the 10th floor up. Stayed out for a while very inconvenient but it came back on and all was well with the world. Overall it was a nice experience very close to the water lovely view and close to the ferry and walking distance to shops and childrens museum.", "offset": [925, 968], "date": "2015-07-08", "cpt": "0", "category": "pool"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "cad9e0c1-95c2-402a-a8d6-81ba3948516c", "sentence": "Disappointed.

I was sent to Portsmouth for a 4 day conference training for work. I was to stay at the Renaissance Portsmouth Norfolk Waterfront Hotel. WELL I am extremely elated to tell you I wish I got there sooner. I was greeted by the most professional staff anyone could hope for. Even thought it was late night the clerk insured I knew where to eat within 5 minutes walk. I was on the 11th floor and she made sure I had a view. And it was a spectacular view particularly in the evening with the sunsets. 121. I took in one eater and was just as described by the clerk. Oh and she called to the room a few minutes after I got in my room to ensure all was ok I like the view and to ensure my comfort was cared for. Exceptionally clean room wonderfully appointed beds coverings. The only thing lacking would be a in room vault. The bath was oversized and I enjoyed the shampoo of Rosemary and Mint. Plenty of towels. The indoor pool and whirlpool was a great way to start the day. Wonderful deck here looking out on the ship building docks. 104F in the whirlpool and the pool was at a perfect 78 degrees for swimming laps to get in the morning exercise. There were large clean towels a on every station point. This is directly next to the work out area which was clean bright well equipped and for once ALL of the equipment was operational. The bar scene was very nice and the staff so willing to please. The Last call was not just shouted out but the lead bar tender made his way around and ensured everyone there had an opportunity to put in their last order. The bar food was excellent I did find that eating a table top to be better then at the bar. The bar is massive. I was also pleased to find that the parting garage had a height restriction of 10 feet and was well lighted and very clean. Further I found delight in the fact that the lady vacuuming the carpet made it a point to stop as I approached introduced herself to me and I her. She asked where I traveled from and how long would I be there. She was smiling warm friendly and told me that should she be able to make my staff better she would be delighted to help. If you smoke there are many well appointed areas outside for this. Just past the wonderful fire place nice to sit next to on those cool knights. When you return from you day out and about you are greeted at the front with cookies refreshing iced water lemon lime fresh fruit. What a nice way to come back from a day of toils. I will return here for fun with my wife.

The thing that jumps out for me with this hotel is the great customer service from the front desk. I made a mistake on some reservations and they helped me out and helped me avoid a cancellation fee. Check in was very efficient. I use a Mariot rewards credit card which seems to have granted me even better service. Nice clean lobby area with free newspapers desktop computers with printers and even apples at the front desk. Scenic views from the rooms of the river and ships. I would guess this is the best place to stay in Portsmouth. Internet wifi is free. Gym is adequate. Indoor pool is the typical undersized tub. I got a discounted rate of 94 night for my room because I was there for a scheduled event otherwise the rate would have been about 115. A downer is that most of the rooms I have stayed here four times seem to have interior connecting doors between the rooms which increases the noise from neighboring rooms. Avoid the bar. The service is terrible they often run out of items drink prices are high and bartenders seem unable to prepare proper high end cocktails such as martinis. There are better watering holes with 3 miles and the downtown location and neighborhood is safe. I have a separate rating for the on site restaurant. The highlight of the restaurant is the breakfast buffet. It is good but overpriced at about 140. Also you used to be able to include the buffet in your room cost at a discontinued price but this package seems to no longer be available. Another source of irritation is the forced valet parking for hotel guests. This venue would possibly raise to five stars if the bar parking noise from neighboring rooms and restaurant shortcomings were remedied.", "offset": [601, 643], "date": "2018-03-07", "cpt": "1", "category": "pool"}, {"id": 12, "uid": "40778e51-0545-4453-aa25-33cf05650a78", "sentence": "Good.

I walked into the lobby after using valet parking and admittedly I was impressed. The ground floor was beautiful. I went up to my room and the severe contrast between the lobby and room was disappointing. The room smelled very musty and the decor felt dated 80s. However we were on the 9th floor and the view overlooking the water was great. The pool was unoccupied both times we went which was a plus. The hotel was also near the ferry 4 round trip for adults to Norfolk which we used to our advantage. We also thought there were a number of decent restaurants within walking distance eg Biergarten Legend Brewing Co. We also liked the proximity of the Children \u2019s Museum of Virginia. Okay so the day after we checked in we had run out of clean towels and we had assumed housekeeping would take care of things while we were gone for most of the morning. That was n\u2019t the case as they were working on our floor around 4 pm. We asked housekeeping if they could refresh our room after 5 pm when we would be out for dinner. We also called the front desk to confirm this was okay everyone said it was fine. When we got back from dinner around 830 no housekeeping. We called the front desk to ask for some towels. They said it would n\u2019t be too long even after we volunteered to come down and get them ourselves. An hour later still no towels. We cancelled the order so that our kids would n\u2019t be awakened by a knock at the door. Okay. On day 2 of our stay we assumed housekeeping would visit and they did except they did n\u2019t replace any toiletries and left many of the dirty towels in the bathroom.
