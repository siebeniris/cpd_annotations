After a few minutes we got our stuff off the car but I was not allowed to check in as my car was blocking the driveway I was told. I went to park the car. 15 minutes later I arrive in the lobby to learn the front desk would not check my family in until I arrived. When I did arrive the front desk guy was so occupied with phone calls he could not check us in. I understand that to finish the call your on makes sense. But to take two more calls with a tired family standing in front of you for the last 20 minutes is just rude. when is he did check us in it was cold and clinical and he offered no assistance or asked if we wanted any help. We wandered a bit pushing the hotel cart looking for the elevator. We finally get to our room and we climb in bed only to hear the coming and going if more party goers. This kept going until 3AM.
