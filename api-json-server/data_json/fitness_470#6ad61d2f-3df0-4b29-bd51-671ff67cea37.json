Also Pizza court did not open till 50 pm and had to pay extra for parking which I already have parking as a Disney Pass Holder. Staff and location. Fireworks display was seen from our hotel room.

When you visit Disneyland you do not need to pay for a fancy hotel. You are not there enough. Fairfield Inn is a perfect hotel for a Disneyland stay. Heres why1 Seven minute walking distance from the park. Easy to pop back after lunch and rest up before you return late afternoon evening. it is just past McDonalds so the foot car traffic has thinned a bit by then2 We found all the staff to be extremely helpful friendly and polite. The valet parking worked well. we never waited longer than 5 mins to get our car when we requested it3 We stayed on the 8th floor looking over the pool. The windows are double glazed and the room was quiet enough. It was impeccably clean. I do not think you would want to be at the back of the hotel facing the motorway as it was much noisier and the view is of a carpark. That said if you plan to be at the parks for the whole day and you are just crawling into bed at the end then it is not a big deal. 4 This is a hotel that is quick to get in and out of and on your way. We enjoyed the open air balconies and the viewing spots for the fireworks. You can see the fireworks from anywhere on the balcony5 The room theming is just a quaint touch. How could you compete with Disneyland. Our kids are 9 and 11 and they were chuffed enough with our Nemo room. it is just a bit of fun6 Level 3 cafeteria has good breakfast and reasonable lunch picnic options to take into the park. Toasters for bread. We did not eat pizza there. The coffee was good as far as coffee in the US is7 We had been on the road 9 days. We were just thrilled to have easy access to a washing machine and dryer available levels 2 8 I think. 8 The pool is good for a refreshing dip and bigger than other hotels I have stayed in. Again if you are there for Disneyland it is just a short activity option9 They have iced citrus infused water available just inside the reception foyer. This is a nice touch when you arrive or you have just hoofed it back from the parks10 My 9 year old used the fold out bed. It was fine. The room is big enough and there is room in the fridge for storing snacks fruit milk. Extra infoWe ate at the Pizza Press on Harbour Boulevarde between the Fairfield Inn and the park for either lunch or dinner every day. it is reviewed on Trip Adviser. Fantastic pizza and salad. The best healthy and tasty food option around on that strip Disneyland is a fabulous experience but it is expensive especially when the exchange rate for AUD is so low. We felt the Fairfield Inn gave us great value and it was a really easy hotel for a family on a road trip to stay in. Our kids loved it. We had just come from Las Vegas where we had stayed in a flash 5 star and they would pick Fairfield Inn over that one any day. Fit for purpose wins the day. can not recommend it highly enough.", "offset": [1770, 1922], "date": "2015-08-26", "cpt": "1", "category": "fitness"}, {"id": 8, "uid": "a807a856-4b0b-4b67-98f3-b901b0893d02", "sentence": "Great location to Disneyland. We stayed here for our Disneyland vacation. it is very conveniently located across the street about a 5 10 minute walk. This was great for us to walk the kids back for an afternoon nap before hitting the night activities with Mickey Mouse. There are also dining options nearby for any late night cravings. There is not room service and the pizza hut has limited hours. Since we went on Halloween weekend parking was restricted to 1 car per guest. We still had problems getting out of the parking lot one day because of overflow. Valet had cars blocking the cars parked in spaces. It took awhile to get someone to help us so we had to maneuver our car to inch our way out. A little but of an annoyance but it was a busy weekend. Rooms are clean with the basic amenities.

We stayed here at Thanksgiving for a week. After our 14 hour trip from Australia we arrived to find out room was available to check in straight away. This is not obviously a guarantee. Our room was on the second floor facing Disneyland. The room was clean and tidy it is not a luxury hotel but it is very comfortable and clean. The queen size beds of which there were two were very comfortable. The pull out bed hidden in the couch was fine for our 7 year old it is narrow and I would think no more than 8 10 year olds would fit. There was heaps of room in and we had heaps of luggage. The hotel is right next door to the reasonably priced and yummy food of Mimis Cafe and a 5 8 minute walk to Disneyland and Downtown Disney. A Brea Bread restaurant is almost ready to open any time now. You walk past lots of restaurants including McDonalds. The staff at Fairfield could not have been more attentive kind or supportive. Nothing was too much to ask. We met the General Manager on Thanksgiving day Helen I think she was lovely. The bell desk staff are so friendly with a friendly hello morning and night. There is parking onsite we did not drive though. The staff recommended wonderful service pick ups who we used on a regular basis. When our daughter fell ill and we had to call a doctor they were so understanding and helpful especially when we had to move rooms on the last night. The staff went above and beyond the call of duty. The bell captain on duty was so wonderful. Moving our luggage at 930 at night. They checked on us after the doctor left to see if there was anything they could do to help us. So lovely. Onsite there is a Pizza Hut Express on level 3. Its open until 10 pm and also open for breakfast. They also sell breakfast items cereal fruit pastries and drinks Etc. The hotel has washing machines and dryers a pool and spa. The rooms all come with a safe hair dryer and free wifi in the rooms which was a reasonable speed. The sink is outside the bathroom which is useful if someone is in the bathroom. The big screen TV had a large selection of channels including the Disney channel. Drink and ice machines are on each floor. The foyer has a kids check in and colouring in sheets which our youngest filled in each day. There is also a general little shop with souvenirs washing powders drinks and snacks.

Visited Disneyland and decided to book Fairfield Inn by Mariot. it is literally across the road from Disneyland. This is a pleasant hotel the rooms and hotel lobby are modern.

Room air conditioning is great for extremely hot days. The temperature was 40 degrees Celsius for 2 days but it was always cool in the room. The hotel has a gym and pool. I liked the gym it is a good size and has the right modern equipments for a good workout. The only improvements I had suggest are Sound proof room more. there is an adjoining door to the room next door and I could hear most conversations The downside of a powerful air conditioning wall unit is that it is very noisy.

Last time we stayed here was in August 2017. I left an item in the room and was given the runaround about getting it back. When I asked about it during this trip I was advised I SHOULD HAVE been able to get it released or mailed to me but after 30 days they donate anything left behind. I was bummed because they did not even offer to comp me anything due to their mistake and could not even verify a record with me that i had attempted to get said item back.
