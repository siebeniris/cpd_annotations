This is our 3rd year flying here from Oklahoma City just to stay at this hotel. Our kids now 4 and 6 ca nt wait to come back Next October. It started off with great communication before we even got there with their Chief Concierge David who got us the perfect Casita for our family. We got to the hotel at about 9 am planning on just changing and going swimming but we were able to check into our room early. We had a late flight as well a few night later and we were able to checkout at 3 pm. These little things are extremely helpful. Food is good at Ricos or the BQ place. Polside food is ok about what you expect at a bar next to the pool. What is nice and different is for gold diamond members. isthey gave us 10x2 person a day food vouchers. Often you just get a cont breakfast or exec lounge access but this allowed us to try a different breakfasts around the hotel and then use vouchers towards dinner or lunches. One of our favorite things is to get room service or takeout Stumpys Pizza delivers and Babo Italian has takeout down the street and eat it on the Casita sundeck. There is also a Walgrens and Sprouts down the street for some beverages or some snacks. Pools are great and this year they had kids activities throughout the day like scavenger hunts and hole in one competitions which our kids looked forward to so they could win dip n dots. There is also good hiking trails at Dreamy Draw park a few miles away. It was great to wake up eat breakfast and go on a hike and then come back and go swimming. They have trails for 4 year olds or some tougher ones. Also since we had a late checkout we stopped by the front desk to ask for more towels. They had towels in our room by the time we walked form the lobby to our room. That was amazing. This resort is just nice and relaxing. While there are some areas that could updated it is still a great resort. Overall it was a great stay.

We stayed here for a week in early October. We chose this hotel for it is proximity to both Phoenix and Scotsdale as well as the many pools and water slide. Check in was fast and easy with friendly desk staff. Our room was on the second floor which was much faster to access by the outside staircases than the elevator. It had everything needed for a hotel room mini fridge fairly large bathroom bed and tv. The only thing missing would be a small microwave. The air conditioning worked well but was quite loud at night when it would turn on. Our room had a small balcony overlooking the parking lot but was a close walk to the water park area. Major negative was the fire alarm going off at 4 am for 30 minutes straight. No real fire and no explanation of why it happened. The water park pool area was really spacious. We had no issues finding the perfect spot to get some sun. We took a soft side cooler with some waters and had inconsistent results. One day we were not allowed and had to leave it at the entryway but other days we entered without issue. For being in the desert the pool water was almost too cold at times but we made it work. The water slide only operates during certain times and you have to ask for it to be turned on but it was fun. We also tried the mini golf which was a little dated. The shop in the area had unique things and friendly staff. The one hiccup we had was nearing checkout. We called the desk to ask to borrow the luggage scale to make sure we packed ok for the plane weight limits and after much bouncing around were told they do not have one. Come on Hilton how can you not have a luggage scale. Next time I will pack my own but this should be a common thing in a hotel. Overall the location was great about 15 20 mins from everything. Pool areas were nice and the room was functional.

On site restaurant Hole in The Wall became a favorite with their outdoor dining overlooking the pool area and evenings fireside to enjoy a drink or have smores 2. The Saturday hike to Squak Peak was very entertaining with Keneth and Skylar super fun and friendly hosts. 3. The lazy river is the perfect choice on a hot day and when lounging near the river staff were always stopping by asking if we needed anything drinks or food. The self serve water stations along the property were greatly appreciated too. 4. The sports pool was fun too because it provided a designated place to play we enjoyed volleyball and basketball in the water. 5. The evening Dive In movie was a nice addition too so relaxing with the pool vista lit up. 6. The staff member at the concierge was very helpful too we rented an onsite car for a day to visit Sonoma. A highly recommended side trip 2hrs to visit Slide Rock State Park and Mesa Grill at the Airport and the cute town of Sedona. 7. Loved the nearby Italian Restaurant within walking distance. Tuti Santi Ristorante a local place known for their ravioli homemade family recipe excellent service and staff there as well 8. The Spa Fitness class was a good start to the day we are scheduled for a massage later today too. Again the staff was very accommodating.

This resort hotel has a large water park area and several additional good sized pools scattered around the grounds away from the River Ranch water park. The River Ranch includes a lazy river a winding slow moving river on which one can float on a large tube a water slide that starts out slowly but then increases rapidly before dumping the swimmer out into a large pool All sliders must be a minimum height be able to swim and are not allowed to wear flotation devices such as vests or water wings. and several pools. The largest pool has a waterfall emptying into one end of it and two of the pools have water volleyball nets set up if you want to get a game going. As is the case at almost any pool in Phoenix in the summertime the deck around the pool is likely to be very hot and flip flops are advised. The River Ranch is of course very popular with families while the other pools are usually populated with adults. There is one pool which is adult only if you want to guarantee that there will not be kids in and around the pool. The rooms and suites are fairly typical for a mid level Hilton hotel. We had a squeaky interior door in our suite and a lack of hot water on the morning we left. My major gripe with almost all resorts in Phoenix and many mid to high level hotels across the country is the mandatory resort fee. If you book online and are trying to get the best price you can for your hotel the advertised price is often 2545 less than what you will actually pay and this is not because of taxes. This is the resort fee and it is mandatory. It is often justified because you get free access to high speed Wi Fi parking use of the pools and perhaps a coffee maker and a mini bar or small refrigerator in your room. Of course you get most if not all of these things at no extra charge in other hotels but they do not point that out to you. I maintain that if a fee is mandatory it should be included in the base price of the room. Until most or all resorts do this it is not in any resorts interest to do it so they all continue to advertise a low ball price but add additional mandatory fees once you get there. I am not suggesting that they do not reveal these fees in their advertising. As far as I know they do reveal them with an asterisk and much smaller print at the bottom of the screen or page. I am suggesting that if they want to rent their rooms for 200 a night they should advertise that their rooms are 200 a night. Instead they advertise that their rooms are 170 a night with a 30 a night mandatory resort fee deceitful if not illegal.", "offset": [49, 201], "date": "2017-07-01", "cpt": "0", "category": "parking"}, {"id": 8, "uid": "e7516a18-e146-4b60-a986-4f5f167ebbd9", "sentence": "Great food nice pool park.", "offset": [0, 26], "date": "2017-11-16", "cpt": "0", "category": "parking"}, {"id": 9, "uid": "11e305a0-567b-41b6-9624-3d9ad5b6e11b", "sentence": "Had a bday party for my son here.

It has become a yearly staycation tradition for my kids and I The third year I went I twisted my ankle during a workout in their gym when I stumbled on a piece of uneven flooring. At the time I was able to just walk it off however several hours later while at River Ranch the pain hit suddenly and was severe. My boyfriend had to help me out since I could not walk on that leg and I was visibly hurt and crying with my children following close behind us. I had two different employees watching me leave only one asked if I was okay. My boyfriend told her I had twisted my ankle in the gym and she simply said oh. No one offered to help. He had to leave me on the bench just outside the ranch while he ran to get the car and drive it over. Any of the employees could have called for a golf cart to get me to my room more quickly. That incident still did not stop us from coming back. I always try to give a second chance. However this past year I pre paid for my room using the military family rate when I made the reservation and then later the price dropped for the same room. I contacted Hilton through the chat feature on their website to ask if I could either be charged the lower rate according to the best price guarantee or have a room credit applied for our trip. I also asked if I was going to be charged for the resort fee separately since my original receipt when I paid for the room was not itemized and seemed low. I was told to call the front desk for this info and was told there is no resort fee at this resort. I called the front desk to ask for the new rate and was put on hold for a full 10 minutes before I had to hang up. I was never able to call back but just figured I would provide a screnshot of the price when I checked out if I was charged a resort fee with the original rate. I had to check out with someone at a different desk instead of the main area you would normally check out because there was a line. During checkout I was not offered a printed receipt and was told my receipt would be emailed but I had not gotten it by the time I left Phoenix late that afternoon. I eventually was able to get a copy of my receipt where I saw that they charged me the resort fee after the fact which was fine part of charges I get it. I emailed the above description of what happened with the screnshot attached asking to have the price adjusted to the lower rate I had found. I received an apology but no offer for the price adjustment. I responded with the following. So Hilton does not price match their own rates even for veterans. We prepaid a military family rate and I previously attached the cheaper rate I found on the Hilton website for the same room before our stay attaching again to this email for reference but your hotel will not match the published rate. Was that an oversight or is that an accurate statement. I was sent an email stating a rep would respond within three days yet never received a response. Yet AGAIN I sent an email. And I still have not heard from anyone on this. Hilton customer service has gone down the drain. it is a shame that customers whom have been loyal to the brand as well as Veterans are shown their business does not matter. I will find a new location for our yearly trip and for every other hotel stay coming up. And you guessed it. still nothing. On top of all of this during that stay we had rented a casita. We came back to our room at the end of the day and there was a party going on in the casita attached to us. The people were partying loud smoking weed and parked directly behind my car blocking me in for the night. That party went on all night with no security ever coming to stop it.
