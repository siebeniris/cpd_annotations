Had to book this hotel for a business trip. First time I stayed in this hotel and compared to other hotels I have stayed in while in Munich this one left me with such a bitter after taste. Only good thing about this hotel is the locationWhen I made my reservation at this hotel I selected the option pay upon check in. Somehow they did not understand this since my credit card was charged in full prior to checking in. And from there on it only got worse. The front desk is providing you with different information. Upon check in I was told that bottled water is provided for guests in the mini bar free of charge. This is actually very common in every hotel I have stayed in during my travels. Therefore I thought nothing special of this. Imagine my surprise when upon check out I was charged for the bottles of water and 1 apple juice. The total of the bill for this mini bar was 17 EURO. Ridiculousy overpriced bottles of water if you ask me. My manager and another colleague stayed at the same hotel for the same period. Imagine her surprise when I handed her the hotel receipt. Since she and my colleague paid the same price EURO 20 per night and she and my other colleague were not charged for the water from their mini bar. She was appalled that I was charged for bottles of water. And honestly so was IThe rate paid per night did not even include breakfast as welThe room was also not as expected. Noisy and damp. The rooms could seriously do with some isolationThe beds were very hard. I did not even get to sleep properly. And when asked to change rooms I was told that all beds are hard thus no change of room was honored. It was like sleeping on bricks. The front desk requested house keeping to put another duvet over the matras. This was OK for the first 15 minutes. I felt like the freakin princess on the pea. Would I recommend this hotel. No certainly not. If you are not careful they will even try to charge you for the air you breathe thereThey even tried to charge me for the inrom wifi but since I enrolled in the honors programme they waived this charge. The wifi was crap to say the least it was not even working during my stay there. They kept telling me there are issues with inrom wifi. You are part of a freakin chain and you are unable to offer a stable wifi connection. And then trying to charge for a non working wifi so clasyI really felt like I stayed at a 2 star dump.

There is a hair dryer in the room so no need to try to bring one that works in Europe. We were there at Easter and so each day they brought a rubber duckie to our room as a treat.

This hotel is very dated and is in the process of undergoing a complete renovation. While the renovation may be great for future guests the Hilton Munich City is a TERRIBLE place to stay right now.

The restaurant for dinner is in a hallway outside the breakfast banquet room and the bar area is on the opposite side in the hallway. The Executive Lounge is in a different old banquet room where the hors doeuvres are simply awful.

Apparently the hotel rooms and the hotel itself was renovated a short whole ago so all fixtures are modern and new. Only negative in one of the bathrooms was the sink obviously had a drainage issue as the mucky water was extremely slow to drain. Not sure why it is not rectified but it needs to be asap. The entire hotel staff are fine. However we experienced a few who were not performing at 100 and frankly had a strangeatitude. At least three of the breakfast staff were not friendly and there was one who chatted to us one day then ignored us totally afterwards. Another one seemed to be forced in assisting us in getting coffee and milk as one has to request these items. The cook at the omelette station seemed sarcastic and impatient as we do not know to speak German but was friendly to German speakers. Also when the restaurant is overwhelmed by breakfast crowds they seemed totally disorganized At least 80 of vacated tables were left with dirty dishes for indefinite petiods leaving no available tables for new diners. It took us at least 10 minutes to locate a table that was not as full with used wares so we could at least sit and wait for someone to clear it. As for housekeeping we had one staff member who was lazy. Only replaced washcloths in one of our two rooms. Did not bother to clean the soap dish and just left it full of the used soap remnants. Did not mop the bathroom floor as there was hair clumps from a previous guest on the floor for two days until a different housekeeper apparently came in and cleaned up impeccably. Left our glasses uncleaned unchanged. Thank you to that person. Overall the hotel is great and location is fine in the Haidhausen neighborhood as there are lots of choices for dining. There is a business center in the lobby. But the printer is so obscured that we did not see it and did not print our boarding passes.
