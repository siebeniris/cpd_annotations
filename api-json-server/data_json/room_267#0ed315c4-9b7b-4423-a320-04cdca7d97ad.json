My husband and I celebrated his birthday the weekend before Thanksgiving. Saturday was very busy. There were a few weddings and the winery was pretty packed. Sunday and Monday were very quiet.

I recommend staying during the week if you are looking for a quiet relaxing stay. The room was very nice and clean. There was a lot of storage space for our things. While visiting we did the wine tour and tasting it was great. I loved the wine glasses the wine and speed of service from the bartenders. Our tour guide was very knowledgeable of the wines and it was cool to see the production room. We also ate at a couple of the restaurants. Versailles brunch on Sunday was okay. I was disappointed in the selection of food quality and taste for the price. It was not worth 27 per person. My coffee was luke warm so this was disappointing as well. We ate at Paddys twice while visiting. The food was good and the service was great. We had the fish and chipssplit. because it was more than enough food for us.

I was impressed with the customer service. We asked for the fire pits to be lit by the pool and it was done in no time. The valet men and bell men were also very friendly. I was a little disappointed in the luke warm shower we took daily. My husband encouraged me not to complain about it. The only disadvantage of staying Sunday Tuesday is many of the nice restaurants were closed. We really wanted to eat at the Winery but did not realize it was closed Sunday and Monday.

I agree with all poor reviews of Chateau Elan. I was really excited to spend some time alone with my husband in the resort. The room was outdated.

The carpet has stains which you can see in the mirror pic. The plastic coffee maker and actual coffee is the cheapest type. The bed was comfortable but the bedding sounded like it had plastic in it and is very noisy and not cosy and comfortable. The robes were not even ironed and I think just replaced on hangers as they were so visually unappealing and seriously wrinkled. Wish I had taken more pics. The corduroy type chez lounge was old and looked as if it needed a steam clean too. We paid for late checkout and had a do not disturb sign up and yet housekeeping knocked twice and woke us. The view we had was of the top of a low roof and we kept the curtains closed since it was so ugly. The bathroom was lovely with a great bath and shower although no bath sheets even just normal towels and very basic soaps etc. I was very disappointed as I have stayed in far superior accommodations world wide for much less than the cost at Chateau Elan. I did purchase a sale price on their room as they had Christmas specials and am thinking that perhaps they offer their ugliest rooms to those who buy on sale.

It all started with my two colleagues and I booking an overnight stay to work and enjoy an evening with the girls. After HOURS of shooting around the property we went downstairs to have dinner at Versailles. Upon sitting we noticed there was only one other couple at the restaurant so we thought perfect our food should be out fast. Boy were we wrong. Not only did it take a long time for the waitress to even come acknowledge us she rushed us. I could totally understand a busy night but on Monday because the winery is n\u2019t open it was completely dead. Our waitress Emie was unfriendly and cold the entire time taking our order. Once we finally were able to order our food came out lukewarm. I was so confused but as I said we were tired and hungry so we ate. Plus we did n\u2019t want anyone to spit in our food. they gave off a warning vibe. We ordered a bottle of wine and would n\u2019t you know it. after tracking her down we had to ask for her to give us clean glasses and water which she reluctantly did and with an eye roll. Needless to say we ended up pouring our own drinks. We eat and asked for a to go bag. She finds one behind the hostess stand and hands me a Chinese take out plastic bag. My colleagues kind of chuckled at how embarrassed she was for the restaurant as she had just traveled from paris just weeks before coming here and definitely was n\u2019t handed a plastic bag to take her food in. After dinner we took a few pictures and headed to our room. We were in our room for roughly an hour before we hear loud banging on the door and a woman clearly drunk and in distress asking for her friend \u201c Andrea \u201d. After opening the door to assist her she assaults us in the doorway. My colleague called security atleast 6 7 times before anyone even answers. It \u2019s 1 am and here I am with two other women having to fight off this lady trying to break in our room. After an elapsed time of about 20 30 mins security finally strolls down the hall all nonchalantly and starts arguing with US. He sees the other woman in the hallway and automatically takes her side. It got worse by what ensued next. Not only did he verbally attack me by telling me to \u201c shut the fck up \u201d he also motioned towards me in a threatening manner and gets right in my face and says \u201c did n\u2019t I tell you to be quiet \u201d. I am completely baffled at how this is a 5 star 4 diamond hotel. I was treated like I was at a motel 8 at dinner then I go to my room just to be attacked by a stranger to then be threatened by security. luxury hotel where. The police should \u2019ve been called on their end and they never did until I called at around 10 am. I asked for management and for her to be put out the hotel she was escorted downstairs just for her to be brought right back to her room where she had a greats night rest right in the room next to us for the entire night. There is also a video of the attack that I am gladly posting on all social media platforms. No one deserves to be treated like they \u2019re second rate threatened or assaulted while in a supposedly luxury safe environment. I \u2019ve worked with some of the most luxurious resorts around the world and NEVER had any of this happen to me before. I am holding the hotel their lack of security and this woman responsible for the events leading up to the bruises and scratches on my arms.

The bath was lavish and included shower and garden tub and topped up with all the amenities and toiletries one would expect from a resort like the ChateauThe heart of the Resort is the intoxicating full production winery. Chateau Elan is one of the leading wineries on the East Coast heightened in stature by the people near and far who flock here to taste home grown wine.
