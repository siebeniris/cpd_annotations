Their linen company is sub par because I immediately had them change my bed because there was black stuff on everything which is something housekeeping should have caught and never put the sheets on the bed.

Well return we did in April this year so we thought it only fair to stay there again to see if things had changed. Prior to our bad experience we had nothing but praise for this hotel so the December stay was a real let down for us. I am pleased to say that our stay this time was perfect. Check in and check out was efficient and pain free. Upon check in we were upgraded to a suite which was in the renovated wing of the hotel with massive windows overlooking the KL Tower. The room was spacious and clean so far so good. All of the staff we encountered during our week long stay were gracious and welcoming. Small things at this hotel make a big difference. We left our laundry at the concierge desk a couple of times to be picked up and returned by a local dry cleaning company and the staff were happy to facilitate this for us. We also had delivero food delivered a couple of times late night when we had tired of the room service menu and again this was no trouble for them. The fitness facilities as always were outstanding. The fact that the swimming pool is kept open for guests until late into the night is fantastic. All of the palm trees surrounding the pool are wrapped in fairy lights which makes for a lovely night time swim when the weather is still very humid with the temperature in the 30s.

Newly renovated club lounge is great and the view is just spectacular with both the twin towers and KL tower. Food is great up at the lounge and for those who love booze the cocktail hour is mint. I would recommend having breakfast up here at the lounge as compared to the general breakfast buffet downstairs as it could get quite hectic. Turn down service was prompt and great. The pool is huge and so is the gym. We did try the Mandara Spa there and it turn out to be quite affordable for a hotel spa comparatively with the others in KL. We did ask for a private dining one night and the meal was curated specifically for us. The caviar i thought was superb. The lobster with seafood tortellini was great too and I think the tortellini stole the show haha. In room service for breakfast should be given a praise in my opinion cos it was Better than the general breakfast in my opinion. Parking space was plenty and it \u2019s a 10 ringgit per day multiple entry parking not the best rate seen for a hotel parking but given the good location it was justifiable. If you are sick of hotel food there \u2019s a Nasi Kandar Pelita just a few minutes walk from the hotel. It \u2019s a local food galore. Everything taste nice there. Dynasty one of their main restaurants served the best Roast Peking duck in town so do n\u2019t forget that if you ever dropped by. Their dim sums are great too.

In any case first thing to do before booking is to sign up your membership. Warm welcome and check in out with a smile. Thanks to Anita. West Wing rooms are complete renovated with views on KL Tower. East Wing rooms have views on Petronas Twin Towers but are not yet renovated. We were very lucky because we had a corner room in West Wing at the end of the corridor with views on KL Tower and Petronas Towers. Room is soundproof. Large modern comfortable room large great king bed. Free coffee tea and water. Large comfy bathroom with bath tub and separate rain shower. A lot of shampoos soaps lotions etc. Perfect airco. Location is perfect. 10 Minutes walk to Petronas Towers. Easy for the SoundLight show at the pond in the gardens in the eveningMonorail and metro just across the street. In Kuala Lumpur there is a free busnet GO KL bus with a stop just across the street. We took that bus 3 times but because of the traffic in town it takes a long time for a ride. There is a money changer in front. Included in the Club Lounge Really good breakfast at the Lounge in a restful atmosphere orBreakfast in Temptations restaurant. One of the biggest breakfast buffets I have ever seen. After noon tea at the Lounge with some sandwiches scones and some pastrys. Not very extensive.

My wife I were travelling to Malaysia for the first time and were naturally were excited about our stay at the hotel. On arrival check in seemed to be hurried and did not seem like the staff were trained in hospitality. Seemed like a business transaction rather than a welcome. My wife being in the hotel industry with a brand known for its hospitality in India this is the first thing she noticed. We were allocated a room on the 7th floor in the newly renovated west wing. The west wing and ballroom area were mostly empty throughout our stay and dimly lit. At night it seems you are entering an apartment complex rather than a hotel. It gets a bit lonely since you hardly see any staff in the common areas. The rooms are nice spacious. but I had still avoid staying here. The rooms we were put up in were roadside facing with the KL tower view were not sound proof. On the 2nd night I was awakened by police sirens motorcycles racing down the road. Not cool. On the 3rd night we woke up all sweaty since the electricity had tripped. The AC must have not been working for quite sometime. We called room service who switched the AC back on however after another 10 mins the electricity tripped again. We called again and again it was switched on. The point is if you just renovated your rooms issues like these should not happen. The maintenance guy was not able to find the root cause of the problem and suggested we ask for a room change. We were supposed to check out the following morning would it even be worth the hassle since we were already up. Another nights sleep lost. There are no bathrobes kept in the room. You need to call for them via room service. The ones that came were flimsy cotton ones not the ones you had usually see in other hotels. And honestly they smelled weird. The only good part of the hotel which other reviews also concur is the POOL. It is massive. Loved our time in the water and was refreshing in the KL heat. The breakfast at Temptations is average nothing to write rave reviews about. Indian food is limited to mostly south Indian. On one day there was something which looked like chole chick peas. did not try it though. Their sambhar was weird looking and tasting as well. Western local options are plenty for non vegetarians we stuck with eggs pancakes. The in room dining options felt limited. We called for spaghetti which had the noodles sitting in a bowl of oil olive oil I guess. No taste to the food at all. I added a whole bottle of ketchup to make it consumable. I am not sure if this is a Malaysian thing but if you are ordering pizza or pasta is not oregano andor chili flakes sauce supposed to be served along or at least be available. There was no oregano available in the hotel we had to call for chili sauce every time. Whatever we ate in the hotel did not feel up to the mark and was tasteless we ended up ordering from Grab for most of our meals. I smoke intermittently when traveling and hence do not carry a lighter. Asked the guy cleaning the rooms for a matchbox did not have one he asked me to make do with a used one with 3 4 matches inside and I will keep one in your room when I clean it. did not happen. Asked at the east wing reception they did not have one either. I mean common. I had taken taken a spa package so a 50 minute massage session was included at the Mandara Spa. The spa is located near the east wing end of the pool and you take a staircase down to what looks like the basement or the ground floor. could not figure out since except the door the spa has no windows for natural light to come in. The massage was ok but at least the staff were friendly you could have a conversation with. They lent us their bathrobes the good ones to go back to our rooms in and asked them to be returned. I readily agreed. To conclude at this price point averaging 50 RM night the level of service and hospitality in the hotel leaves much to be desired. I was contemplating between Sofitel Damansara Hotel Stripes Renaissance KL. This turned out to be a wrong choice.
