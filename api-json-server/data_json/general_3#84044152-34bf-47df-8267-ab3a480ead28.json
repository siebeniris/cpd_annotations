There was a dead bird on the ledge outside my window. There was mold growing in the ice bucket. There were stains and grime on many surfaces. The clothes hanger was positioned about 3 feet off the ground. Weird right. No reason for it there was a full closet but the the hanger rod was only have way up the closet and there was nothing above it. So you could not hang your clothes without them resting on the floor. Light bulbs were out in the desk lamp. The air conditioner is position about 6 inches from one of the beds. When it kicks on it makes a loud noise and generates a high wind inside the room. I ended up using all the pillows from one of the beds to create a baffle. This was room 414 if anyone wants to double check me on this. I have got photos of all this stuff.

I normally travel with my own luggage scale for just such occasions but I did not have it this time. I asked whether the hotel kept one handy for guests. The answer was No but let me see if I can find something somewhere that will get the job done. And that is exactly what he did. Then he spent 15 minutes or more helping figure out which items I needed to shift or remove from my suitcase so that I would not have carry more than was absolutely necessary.

Not the cleanest. Dusty. Windows filthy on the outside could not see outside clearly. Furniture falling apart in the room. Torn seats in the breakfast area. NO FREE parking. Had a terrible stay and they did nothing. Never will stay there again.

They had the pictures of the corner rooms instead of the suite rooms so that is what we were expecting. When we arrived and it turns out we were in a suite I was a bit disappointed as it was just 2 hotel rooms with the wall knocked down essentially. When I called the front desk they said they have no control over what Expedia puts on their website. should not it be 201s responsibility to make sure all info about them online is correct. The TV in room 201 was hanging off the wall looking like it was about to fall off at any moment. The 2nd shower did not get hot enough to shower with. The breakfast was confusing as it was supposed to be included with our room but we still got a bill after breakfast with zero explanation. I had to go ask an employee at the hotel why we were getting a bill. They explained that we were just supposed to write our room number down. It made little sense and I can only imagine the number of people who blindly paid for a breakfast meal without a second thought. All in all our stay was certainly NOT worth the 175 per night price tag. Also 55 a day for parking.

I will say the renovations are a huge improvement over what was wrong with this location. We usually use Hotwire to get a random hotel in the Riten House Square area. I would say this hotel does not quite fit into that location but that is another issue. Anyway they are doing a full and total renovation of all the guest floors rooms. It was much needed. The Sheraton was run down and a lot of the furniture was very warn. With the renovation it looks like they redid everything not one single piece of old furniture was leftover. The room was a solid 910. they are still in the process of renovating the hotel. So most floors do not have ice machines I believe 17 19 23 etc random stuff like that call guest services to confirm. As far as I know no floors have vending machines. There is a small coffee bar grab n go area at the bar in the lobby. The location of the hotel is mediocre. Depending on where you are going it is most likely not the most convent. It is an easy on off 676 but that is about it. In the cold windy weekend there was nothing of interest within walking distance. During the summer shopping on Chestnut Street and walking to Rittenhouse square is bareable. Depending on the price the hotel is a solid 34 stars. Since we typically pay less than 100 a night I am going to lean more towards 4 stars.", "offset": [0, 109], "date": "2020-03-02", "cpt": "3", "category": "general"}, {"id": 39, "uid": "d0bce2f3-8255-43fb-9dc0-46c577daf858", "sentence": "No Hot Water.
