For my money this is the best Omni in Texas and I have stayed at six of them. The hotel is clean staff is tip top the rooms are large and well appointed. Unlike the Omni on the katy freeway the restaurant staff is well supervised and the staff is right on top of their game. The food is very good and there is a nice laid back bar with comfortable furniture and no annoying music geared for teenagers. Indeed I could actually hear my companions why having drinks \u2026. no small thing on a business trip. Parking is elf serve or valet but the prices are not that different. Right now access is off of Post Oak as opposed to Wodway because of construction in the area. Speaking of Post Oak this is important because there are so many great attractions and restaurants nearby. Here I do not reference family stuff rather adult venues. In regards to family stuff I was pleased to note zero families at the hotel not one unattended child running around demanding attention. That is huge in my book. I would prefer a real coffee maker in the room but they do have the annoying one cup at a time versions. This offered real coffee is available in the morning around six of the clock. The hotel also provides the WSJ and local papers. The grounds are very nice but I saw no evidence of the two black swans that once were in evidence. The pool area is very nice though the hours do not align well with folks who want to swim early or late.", "offset": [100, 175], "date": "2016-01-09", "cpt": "0", "category": "room"}, {"id": 2, "uid": "ac7b5c1d-c079-4d24-a9e4-583d94664c87", "sentence": "Spacious rooms clean excellent breakfast.", "offset": [0, 41], "date": "2016-03-24", "cpt": "0", "category": "room"}, {"id": 3, "uid": "bb9245bb-a509-451d-a08b-7e842f836c58", "sentence": "My room was clean and ready when I arrived at check in time.

Overall it was a nice stay and we enjoyed ourselves. However this hotel missed the mark in several areas that are worth mentioning. The Good. The property is located in a nice area and the grounds are well kept. Pool area and the pool itself are excellent. The lobby is nice and has a good feel. The rooms are quiet and comfortable and the bed was very comfortable. The staff were all nice and the valet door guys up front were exceptionally nice and helpful. The Not So Good. We booked a king bed and received confirmation via email that our reservation was for a king bed. When we arrived in our room we discovered they put us in a room with two queens. So we had to go back downstairs and get this corrected. When the staff checks you into your room they should tell you what type of room they are putting you in to avoid this hassle. As we were leaving our room we discovered our room safe was locked and we could not access it. So we had to call and wait around for somebody to come unlock the safe so we could store our valuables and leave our room. They were able to get somebody to our room and unlock the safe at which point we discovered the prior guest had stored leftover food in the safe. Not good. We also discovered a prior guest had jammed tissue paper in the peephole of the door so we could not see through the peephole. We had the guy that repaired our room safe use a tool to remove the tissue. When we returned to our room later that night our room keys did not work. So we had to go back downstairs and have the keys fixed. The hotel employee fixed the keys promptly but never offered an apology for the inconvenience. The room key also did not work when we tried to leave the parking garage so we had to press the message button and wait for somebody to let us out. Speaking of parking they charge you over 20 to self park your car in their spacious and mostly empty parking garage. This is silly and should be included in the cost of the room. And a huge peeve of mine is being nickel and dimed when I am in a hotel. 7 for an in room bottled water and 10 for Wi Fi is extremely annoying. And if you want decent speed on your Wi Fi it is a whopping 15. Why not just charge me for cable television and the soap and shampoo. Last item was during my check in the guy referred to me as bud. Not a huge deal but sir is much more appropriate in a hotel that wants to be in the 4 5 star range. Basically if you want to stay here make sure to add another 50 to your stay per night for parking Wi Fi and water. Hopefully management will work out all the little issues we had to deal with during our stay.", "offset": [1941, 2002], "date": "2019-05-22", "cpt": "1", "category": "room"}, {"id": 15, "uid": "5b6f922f-cd89-4836-a537-61984d66e15f", "sentence": "Go Spend Your Somewhere Else. For my wedding night I looked for a hotel that was near our venue in the Galleria. I chose the Omni but what a mistake that was. My husband and I could not sleep at all. The bed was horribly uncomfortable. We had leftovers from our wedding and the room did not have an empty fridge. For the amount we were paying I did not even check to see if the room came with a fridge. I incorrectly assumed all hotels especially at this price point had this amenity. We did call the front desk and they were able to provide us with fridge thankfully. We ordered room service and again for what we paid for we should have received a 5star meal but it would have been cheaper to go to a local eatery.

I am a frequent traveler and top tier elite with IHG Spire Ambassador and Hilton Diamond but ended up at this Omni for a friends wedding weekend. I joined the loyalty program and also booked my stay through American Express Platinums Hotel Collection to see what sort of benefits I could score. Obviously your mileage may vary as this is always subject to availability and at the hotels direction but I was very pleasantly surprised with the degree to which Omnis staff went above and beyond to make our stay comfortable. We were upgraded to a Galleria Suite which is a fairly large 2rom arrangement with a living area and separate bedroom thanks to purchasing via AmEx Hotel Collection. The suites are very nicely appointed but I was surprised that the doors that separate the bedroom from the living area have windowles windows covered only by mesh curtains with no class plastic. One person can not watch TV in the living room without disturbing someone sleeping in the bedroom. But they are still phenomenal. Be warned however that the rooms ending in 19 are directly adjacent to an elevator shaft which we found to be too noisy for us. We were graciously accommodated when we asked to switch to another suite far away from the elevators. Booking through AmEx Hotel Collection also provides a 100 hotel credit good toward your incidentals which is a great way to sample some of the various on property amenities. We applied 12 of it to self parking fees and the rest to a few small orders from Birdies one of their bar cafesAs a Select Guest member even Gold which is their lowest tier. I received two drink vouchers at check in which we used for a couple wines at the bar. The pool is heated and open year round. We did not get to swim but loved having the option. Gym is very very nicely appointed including Peloton bikes. TVs in the rooms are EXCELLENT and have built in Chromecast so you can BYOD and watch whatever you want which I love. It drives me crazy when hotels lock the TVs down so you can not use the HDMI input or get your own media onto them. I did not test the HDMI here so I do not know if you could actually plug into it but it would not surprise me. I am always baffled that hotels think the presumably small amount of revenue that may come from paid TV media is worth the terribly frustrating experience customers have of trying to jack around with a TV that has had its basic functionality altered for the sole purpose of preventing us from doing what we want to do. Ugh Anyway THANK YOU Omni for being awesome in that regard. One thing that was important to us in the Galleria Suite was having enough space for our 3year old. The rolaway beds Omni provides fit albeit snugly into the bedroom side of the suite meaning the living room is available for adults to hang out in after a kid has been put to bed. Again real doors separating the rooms would be awesome but at the end of the day just having a nice upgrade was clutch. Props to Tomas for help getting the suite sorted and to Missy for helping to answer all my questions and also for the chocolate strawberries and the cheese plate after we had to change rooms. Oh someone also left us a cookie and a little carton of whole milk for our kid the night before when they brought in the rolaway bed which was a delightful touch. Overall very impressed with the Omni. These little touches go a long freaking way and I am definitely going to start looking for Omnis more on my non wedding travel now that I see the quality of the experience. Just top notch here very impressed all around and even with 6 weddings happening here this weekend somehow everything was managed without any noticeable issues.
