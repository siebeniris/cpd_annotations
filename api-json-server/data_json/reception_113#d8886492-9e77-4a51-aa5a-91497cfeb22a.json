This Hotel is beautiful great location lovely quiet bedrooms and some genuinely great staff. However I feel strongly that unles you have a bottomless pit of money they do not really want to know. We arrived late one night after almost 24 hours travelling partly due to a diverted flight. Added to that my purse had been lost stolen earlier in London. The room was pre paid for in full but because I had no credit card we were not allowed to check in. I explained that my purse was missing but the reception staff were totally inflexible and left myself and 2 teenage children sitting in the lobby. We asked about getting some tea they were totally unhelpful sent us down to bar where we did get some tea at 6 dollars a cup. After a couple of hours they gave me the option of paying cash to secure the room I only had 200 dollars on me which I offered this was rejected they wanted 1000 but would accept 500 at a push this would be returned to me when leaving. So we waited again until thankfully some of our group already in the hotel returned from an evening out and came to our aid with their credit card. I could totally understand this happening if the room was not paid for but it was paid for in full in advance. I really think that we would have spent the night sitting in the lobby had our friends not returned when they did. Can you imagine that happening in Ireland. At the very least I felt the hotel should have given us complimentary tea coffee. There were other smaller issues during our stay the room was not serviced for 3 days ringing down looking for toiletries milk resulted in at least 30 minute wait a car parking charge on our final bill when we had no car. i should say that there were some lovely helpful staff in the hotel but all the luxury and opulence in the world will make up for the cold inflexible attitude of this hotel.", "offset": [13, 105], "date": "2015-02-24", "cpt": "0", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 3, "uid": "9b08038a-076b-4a57-b3e6-709bc188954a", "sentence": "The Mondrian still has it.

The view was really nice. We were in the 11th floor and street noise was only a minor issue in the AM. If we were below the 5th floor i m sure the street noise would have woke us up earlier while facing sunset blvd. The building itself is cold. Looks kind of like an office building. The Hollywood charm that u may see from the chateau Marmont or even the sunset towers next door will not exist here. However if you are looking for a great location fun daytime pool parties and good looking people then you may have found your spot. The weekend pool parties at the sky bar are pretty awesome. Taylor and Milan who work the pool are the highlight to this staff. Treat them well and they will be sure to always check in on you. The Mondrian scene is not for children and not for the elderly. Its for the young hip sexy crowd that wants a good time does nt mind paying 16 for a drink and 10 for a bottle of water.

Upon waking up on 215 I found my bedshets had a weird stain on the edge. I raised it to the attention of the front desk and they let me know that they would notify housekeeping and address the issue while I was out. When I returned I checked in at the desk and they confirmed that it should \u2019ve been handled. When I got back to my room the room service tray from 9 pm the night before was in the hallway the room itself has not been serviced and the sheets were still on the bed. While I was gathering my stuff to once again leave housekeeping knocked on the door and asked if I needed a cleaning. I had to re explain the issue. I let the front desk know they apologized and said that they \u2019d talk to the housekeeping manager. no attempt of service recovery. On 216 before checking out I laid out a towel on the floor of the bathroom and noticed a dark stain on it. On checkout I brought it to the attention of the front desk and they apologized. Again no attempt at service recovery. I noted that for a high quality hotel stained sheets and towels is n\u2019t acceptable and expressed my surprise that the hotel had n\u2019t offered anything in terms of a real apology. The front desk agent offered to get a manager and stepped off for a few minutes only to return with information that a manager was n\u2019t available. As an anecdote it took me 10 minutes to get anyone \u2019s attention when I was trying to get a table for breakfast. The host stand was n\u2019t manned and waiters were not paying attention. I provided them with my mobile number at 750am and as of 945 I have not been contacted. Clearly there \u2019s an issue with the hotel \u2019s laundry service but staff is neither empowered to or interested in delivering service either. I gave the hotel a couple chances to be proactive here and am very disappointed going forward I wo n\u2019t be staying at the property.", "offset": [908, 939], "date": "2020-02-16", "cpt": "2", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 28, "uid": "32e366f0-c884-4aea-ba73-9dd652650495", "sentence": "Stained sheets and towels no attempt to recover.

Well where do I start. From beginning to end it was an AWFUL experience. I do nt ask for much I have simple expectations. I travel often and have never reviewed a hotel until now because I feel so compelled to warn others. To start I asked that champagne be waiting in the room to surprise my significant other upon arrival. key word surprise. Before we went up I verified with the front desk that everything was prepared. They said yes. As we were approaching the room a gentlemen who appeared to be housekeeping was in the hallway and said brought the ice bucket just in time. Okay. way to ruin the surprise. We get into the room ready to do a toast and there are no champagne glasses. I had to called twice and then had to walk to the front desk and request that the glasses be brought up. In total it took 45 min before they FINALLY brought up the glasses. But WAIT it gets worse. I go to the bathroom I can tell it has not been mopped bc there was a small piece of tissue of the floor and the tile looked a little dingy. But I was not going to make it an issue. However We go to shower to get ready for the evening and the TUB IS DIRTY. There was hair multiple small strands that anyone with decent vision would have spotted. The water faucets clearly had not been wiped. As I am typing this I wish I took photos. I call immediately for someone to clean it and you guessed it another 45 minutes and I had to call twice before someone came. Housekeeping comes to clean it she was in the bathroom for about ten minutes. My boyfriend and I were on the bed so we could not see what she was doing. I could see from the position of the bed out of my peripheral that she was mopping. She leaves we thank her then. I go to get back in the shower and it looks the EXACT SAME. I was SO PERPLEXED AND DISGUSTED. DID NO ONE COMMUNICATE THAT IT WAS THE TUB THAT NEEDED TO BE CLEANED. I FELT LIKE I WAS IN THE TWILIGHT ZONE. At this point I proceeded to take a shower because we were already running late bc of the delay. I spent the rest of the weekend cringing because the bathroom was not properly cleaned. On top of lack of cleanliness. This hotel was either short staffed or lacked a sense of urgency. EVERY SINGLE TIME I called the front desk and asked for water I was transferred to housekeeping who then transferred me to room service. or vice versa. One morning I was on the phone for five minutes just simply trying to get water brought to the room. and you can probably guess at this point how long it took. 30 45 minutes as I die of thirst I have NEVER in my life experienced this type of inconvenience at a 4 star hotel at 250 a night. Please take your hard earned money and stay some where else. What a disappointment. I would not stay here again if I were being held at gun point. Also your patio chairs are dingy.", "offset": [2220, 2356], "date": "2020-03-04", "cpt": "2", "category": "reception"}]}
