Overall it was a good stay however it is more of a very nice aparthotel than proper 5star hotel. Service can be an issue depending who you are talking to. For example when I called the front desk to request a pan they told me they do not have any but when I spoke to the room service guys they luckily provided me with one. Definitely make use of the pool and the gym area as these are top notch. Room tip we had a double room 1016 which was a lot nicer than a king room.

After a long six and difficult six months on a personal front I opted to unwind in Miami and attend a concert. The Viceroy was one of my several options in the general area. There are a lot of great things about this hotel but also some issues that makes this place truly unique and one that I would choose to go out of my way to return. First off let me state that the hotel staff are really professional cordial and welcoming. For the price I paid \u2013 this hotel in in the same price range during my stay in late June as the Epic Mandarin JW Four Seasons etc. Pros \u2013 there are many \u2013 but the staff is definitely a strength. The staff absolutely wonderful they are friendly courteous and very helpful. Amenities The Bose sound dock is a nice touch. The Ily coffee machine is just wonderful what a great offering. The pool wonderfulCleanes \u2013. The room hotel pool etc were all very clean and well presented. The room nicely appointed with its own edginess and elegance. Service \u2013 service at the pool was great prompt and the staff was more than willing to accommodate me to cram in a few hours of sun and a drink. Location close to the AA arena and downtownCons \u2013 unfortunately there are some basics that I would not expect \u2026 in no particular order Malfunctions TV not working an engineer came up to fix it. After 10 minutes or so it worked fine. Wonderful staff. Next day it stopped working again I opted to spend more time reading at the pool. Basics getting ready I realized that the room did not have an iron no issue \u2013 in all fairness perhaps the prior guest took it. A call and someone quickly came up with an iron. Again great stafTowels. wow the cheap towels I bought when I was in my 20s to save a few dollars were richer and better. The thin towels offered by the Viceroy is on par in my opinion with that of a budget hotel. The pool towels HORRIBLE ripped and ragedy. Bed Chair the 85 a night Sheraton in Cyrpres Creek has a better bed better quality sheets and better pillows. The chair really uncomfortable and the fabric seats clearly showed a stain. I found a good use for the towels. Parking Valet Location OMG. The traffic and flow to the valet is just HORIBLENoise perhaps this is a more difficult challenge that is beyond the control of the hotel \u2013 but a good FYI for others needing some sleep. Brickel is noisy and staying on the 9th floor \u2013 I ca n\u2019t get past the traffic noise. Sound insulation is not all that good I kept the music on all night to drown out the traffic. This is a cool run trendy hotel \u2013 but it is suffering from some very basic quality challenges some easily addressable. In my opinion there is a lot of style \u2013 but substance can be improved. For a more comfortable experience I found other nearby options better.

Stayed in this hotel for one night after returning from a cruise in early July. Arrived by taxi and were greeted by the porters immediately who opened the car doors and took our luggage inside. The employees at the check in desk were wonderfully friendly and amicable. We had arrived quite early so our room was not ready yet. But our luggage was taken care of and a very nice museum was recommended Philip and Patricia Frost Museum of Science really something to see with a great aquarium. Also free water bottles are provided every time you want them when you pass the desk. A nice touch for the oppressively hot weather. We were called probably around 1 or 130 pm to be told our room was ready early. The room itself was quite spectacular. We had a suite with a large balcony with view over the river and harbor. The bedroom is huge with a great bathroom with separate bath and shower and water room. The bed is large and cozy. The sitting area separated by a double door unfortunately no lock was also impressive with nice furnishings and a fold out bed that housekeeping will prepare in the evening. There is only a half bath here with only a toilet. We did only have one robe in the closet when we arrived but when I mentioned this to the porter bringing our luggage up he was back in less than 5 minutes with two more. I would say the television remote in the bedroom seemed to have a very short range so that it was not usable while lying in bed. But this may have been low batteries. Regardless I never found it important enough to mention it to the front desk. The rooftop pools on the 15th floor are quite amazing with a massive main pool and a smaller jaqcuzi pool and kids pool. I will say the jacuzi pool is very very hot. But you do get used to it although I preferred the main pool with its breathtaking views over the harbor. The seating is plentiful and comfortable with large cushioned beds to lie on. The drink service was a bit slow and sporadic but it seemed they only had a few servers for a very large area. When we entered the pool area we were given pink wristbands instead of the more common yellow which they told us was VIP although I can not tell you exactly what the difference is if there is one. We did not use the spa. We did eat at the restaurant one night. The service was fantastic. But the menu itself was a bit limited. As a vegetarian there was essentially one vegetable dish to choose. It was pleasant enough but not very memorable. I would advise eating on the patio as the night views are just as stunning. We did stay out quite late checking out the nearby canal walk and garden market along with a midnight harbor cruise. And since our flights were in the evening the next day I inquired if we could get a late checkout. Not only did they provide this but free of charge. Again the person at the desk was so friendly and accommodating. Really I have stayed in many luxury establishments around the world and I would put this up with the best of them.
