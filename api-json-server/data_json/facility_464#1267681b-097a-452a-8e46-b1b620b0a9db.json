The annual conference of Jewish Genealogy was held at the Ramada Hotel Jerusalem this year. It is a an annual conference held at different venues mainly in the USA and occasional in European cities. I was hesitant to write this review because I could not find anything good to report which made me feel very uncomfortable. On arrival I drove up to the main foyer. The security guard sat at his post and told me that I should take my bags out and leave them with him while I parked the car in the basement. He sat there watch me lug my suitcases out and never left his chair for a moment. I ask him if there was a porter and he pointed to a desk inside. I went to look and there was no one there. This guard never got off his chair to help me and watched me put everything on the pavement. I them parked my car in the basement. The smell in the basement was overwhelmingly discusting. Rotting garbage and sewerage. I went to collect the bags with a porter and then I checked in. The check in was not bad. Certainly not warm and friendly. I got to my room and the electronic key did not work and so the porter went down to change it for me. The room was on the 9th floor and near to the lift a nice plus. The rooms are fairly large and furnished about 30 to 40 years ago. old and shabby. There is a desk chair and a coffee table with one reading chair in a double room for two people. The bathroom was ok. Cheap products and a shower. The shower had a very poor shower head but all this did not both me. I ran the shower and up came the smell from the basement. Awful and discusting. There was black mould on the sealant and round the glass partition on the tiles. The electronic key only worked once. I started having to go back down stairs to get it reconected everytime I came back to the room. I got the regular key and used that for the rest of the week. Enough with all this. The food was overpriced badly prepared and generally inedible. It takes some doing to mess up a toasted cheese sandwich and chips. The bill was 60shekels with a bottle water. A complete rip off. Then came breakfast. the usual Israeli fare but pared down to the minimum and poorly prepared. The waiters were un obliging and surly and most unhelpful. I felt I was intruding on their time just by asking a question. The chaos reigned in the hotel which being a polite way of saying it was awful. Lunch was much of the same. The housekeeping was ok when the came which was late in the day which suited me. Mostly the attitude of the staff was bad. They either ignored you made you feel like they were doing you a favor and in the end I just did not bother with them. I can not name one smily face. I have no idea why the conference was held there. I suppose they got a good deal and it was cheap but nasty it was and is. Avoid this place it is awful and located far away from any restaurants laundries or or anything else tourist look forward to having on a vacation.", "offset": [1724, 1819], "date": "2015-07-09", "cpt": "0", "category": "facility"}, {"id": 5, "uid": "0734f307-f55d-4652-b65a-e29888c12741", "sentence": "Avoid the Ramada Jerusalem. it is tired out of date no parking for guests other than inadequate street parking no valet services.

I really wanted to like this hotel knowing that I was going to spend a week there for a conference. Sadly it was full of disappointments. Conference was great hotel not so much. When I checked into my room one half of the closet door was broken would not slide open. It took three hours and five phone calls to get an engineer to fix it the second engineer since the first one did not have a clue. So three hours wasted waiting to unpack. The rooms are a nice size for a hotel of this class but mostly dirty something I have rarely encountered in what is supposed to be a 4 star hotel. Hotel management must know that there is no dusting of shelves or closets rare vacuuming carpets or cleaning of mildew in the showers. Dirty tape over the holes in the wall and so on. This is standard for all the rooms so moving rooms will not help. Windows appear not to have been cleaned in years. My room was quiet bed was fine although someone else reported bed bugs and my Internet worked well although the majority of those attending the conference reported constant connectivity problems. I assume quality of Internet is due to ones location in the hotel. I was on the 7th floor. Room cleaning erratic. Some days you get a bathmat others not. No wash cloths for the 7th floor but other rooms got them. I had no drinking glass in the bathroom upon check in and for three days after just paper coffee cups until I made a special request. Clearly they are short on items OR housekeeping provides no check list for employees. Once a supervisor opened my door without knocking claiming he was checking on housekeeping. Breakfast food plentiful but almost inedible. Stale bread laid out near the toaster hard a a rock. Hard boiled eggs good but other cooked food was mostly disgusting looking and tasteless. No OJ just tang with artificial sweetener. Had to hunt down someone to pour coffee. Upstairs restaurant slow service average quality food. Public and lobby space was attractive and large however. Front desk staff varied from helpful to antagonistic. When checking a speakers registration one clerk was angrily insistent that no such reservation existed. Once he realized he had spelled the last name wrong after several minutes of back and forth no apology. The hotel is out of the town center even though close to a few Museums Knesset and archives so no feeling of neighborhood and nowhere to walk except the new mall. Unles you are religious andor want glat kosher food or are part of a conference and can live with the dirty feeling in the rooms avoid this place. As a tourist to the lovely city of Jerusalem and I have been several times in hotels large and small. this is the last place I would stay at any price. Despite the letters from management seen here saying they wished they had known about these issues surely they must know they read TripAdvisor and these complaints are standard for the past three years yet at the hotel there appears to be little interest at all in rectifying situations when they are brought to the hotels attention or to do a full cleaning of all the rooms fix holes remove dirty tape etc. Management needs vast improvement in more than writing letters to TripAdvisor about second chances and should invest some money in cleaning the rooms and working on housekeeping service and the overall demeanor of most of their staff. Any conference group booking this hotel should demand more too before not after their attendees check in.", "offset": [0, 82], "date": "2015-07-14", "cpt": "0", "category": "facility"}, {"id": 7, "uid": "7b60db46-51e4-4bb9-a251-271ea7e9a7a8", "sentence": "Worst Hotel experience ever. I was here for a genealogy conference and agree with the many negative reviews. Dissatisfying incompetent customer service. I was apparently annoying front desk and lounge staff for information and services and how about a smile PEOPLE. Very long waits for lounge food or drink orders only two or three wait staff for 100 200 guest in lounge and adjacent restaurants. Coffee service for the conference I attended was not complimentary for the first few days. You were required to pay with a ticket which required payment at front desk area where long lines for all services caused long delays. I was told there were no exchange rate or local currency cash opportunities at front desk. Front desk had no information on bus train or local rail time tables the hotel was remotely located away from most major tour sites and points of interest. No toiletries for forgotten items I would have had to buy 20 packs of razors and large tube of toothpaste at gift shop. Debie S Executive Office wants me to run over to some mall twenty minutes away at 90 pm. Lounge staff on a number of occasions would routinely shut off lights without warning at midnight while guests were still present and eating or drinking or conducting business it is a hotel. People are coming and going all the time and want some place to relax other than their rooms even after midnight. The taxis were not monitored for exorbitant charges or lack of interest in taking you to your destination. Only one small glimer of light on my last day before checking out. When it appeared I exhausted my efforts to get a taxi a staff member told me the central bus station was only a stop away from the hotel by light rail and cheaper. Thank you for the only time I felt welcomed Ms Front Desk member. Debie S Executive Office It would be nice if I even knew there was a Cinema City or Mall to go to but the staff at this hotel apparently wanted to keep it a secret and us hostage. There was no concierge what star hotel was this againNo other place to buy 7 11 style groceries. No information indicating breakfast buffet in lower level. Wifi was broken at times especially in rooms. No iron in the room for light ironing. There was an ironing room in the basement with no easy access for water for steam ironing and they were not filled with water. Touch screen kiosk near reception area thin on information for transportation ads really. Hotel provided lunches for special genealogy conference lectures which cost 35 extra consisted of tea sandwiches and salads seriouslyI guess I could have ask the guests staying for the conference for information which on occasion I did but I am paying a good shekel and expect decent service for that shekel.
