My wife and I decided to give Punta Cana one more try as this trip was our fifth to the island. We arrived in the early evening and were greeted in the lobby with a tropical beverage. We arrived and were pleasantly greeted at the reception desk. This was the first time I have never had to wait in a long line to check in. We did not like the old style keys which we received for our room but we adapted to it quite quickly. The key took a few turns to actually get the door open. We stayed on the top floor with a garden view over looking the other Riu resort. Like other reviews have said before it was quiet in the evening but a little noisy in he morning because it was next to a service road. It did not bother me because I am an early riser. If you do like to stay out late and sleep in I would suggest a pool view room. The room was VERY CLEAN and barely had any of the musty smell that most reviewers were complaining about. I have stayed in Punta Cana before and this was the best smelling room. 306 if anyone wants to request it king bed. Our room was on the top floor and sometimes after a long day the stairs going up to our room was a bit of a climb. The elevator in the mid section of that side of the hotel was not too reliable. Dining at the Riu was an experience like no other I have had in Punta Cana. The food at this resort was a step above other resorts. That is all I am going to comment about the food because everyone is different. I will recommend the Brazilian restaurant and the Steakhouse close to the beach. If you like Japanese food you will be disappointed with that theme restaurant and I did not bother going to the Italian theme because I have not heard a good thing about it. The pool area is very nice but it is lacking more pool. A resort of this size could have put a little more concentration in the pool area. The swim up bar area is awesome but like other people have said stay away from there after 2 pm it gets pretty crowded and rowdy. There is plenty of beach area and plenty of chairs but I would head down earlier in the morning to stake out a spot just in case. The area near the lunch restaurant is a bit quieter and closer to a washroom. I guarantee you will never go thirsty anywhere at this resort. There is always a bar around a server who will bring you drinks and in room fridge which is always stocked. The mixed drinks were a little stronger than usual so I stuck to beer most of the time. I do not recommend going anywhere near the so called casino. it is pretty much 8 slot machines and one black jack table. There is a lot of wasted space in the main lobby area which could easily be transformed into a world class casino. I probably would not return to this resort because I have had enough of Punta Cana. But I will try other Riu properties at other destinations. I would recommend this resort for someone who wants to travel to Punta Cana.", "offset": [794, 872], "date": "2015-01-25", "cpt": "0", "category": "general"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "fbd5b6df-7a90-4db7-8abb-5ecd38cd4005", "sentence": "This is an awesome property.

I do not even know where to start when it comes to writing this review. There were so many positive aspects to this trip. Let me just say that our stay to Hotel Riu Palace Punta Cana was nothing short of PERFECT. Our room was just amazing. HUGE and spotless. We were facing the pool palm trees and beautiful blue waters. We were a corner unit Room 2046. so our balcony was huge and wrapped around the corner of the building. We enjoyed our coffee there each morning and a night cap each evening. The frig was always stocked and there was even top shelf alcohol in the room. This hotel is all inclusive so nothing additional out of pocket. If we ran out of Presidente the island beer water soda etc. all you had to do was call and there were there rather quickly. We had a sunken tub in our room with huge columns which opened up to a HUGE bathroom. The staff was amazing. always friendly and willing to help assist. There were daily activities such as pool side games bingo ping pong water aerobics etc. They even gave out prizes. The swim up bar closes at 6 pm and that was our only hint of the time as there are no clocks. Got ta love island time. Riu Punta Cana guests have a gold band so we can enjoy all the many benefits of the other Riu hotels that are in walking distance. however they can not come to us. Made you feel important. There was nightly entertainment but we opted to enjoy our opportunity to sleep. They offer several restaurants on the property ranging from Italian to Japanese but you have to make reservations. There is one restaurant. I believe it is Miquels that does not require reservations. you go when you are ready. It was our favorite. The hosts became family. We were welcomed with hugs and the food was OUTSTANDING. We did have reservations one night at the The Steakhouse. The steak was a little to tough for me. but would NEVER stop me from going back to this hotel. Also there is a small casino on the property. do not waste your time or money. Oh and I almost forgot our ceiling leaked over our wet bar due to the air conditioning. Gave a new meaning to the Wet Bar. It obviously did not bother me much. as I almost forgot it happened. Nothing a view towels can not handle. Overall we made a ton of friends from all over the world and I am crossing my fingers that we are able to go back next year. Definitely could get use to island time beautiful blue waters amazing food love breakfast and fantastic staff.

To start with we had like to say that after reading previous posts on here we were going to hotel knowing what we can expect. We said we are keep our minds open and will not let little things spoil our holiday. And that is exactly what we did. On arrival hotel makes a great impression. Beautiful lobby. Yes there is no ac in communal areas but the fans are on 247 and when you are getting in from hothumid air outside you can easly feel the difference. Eldery people or people that can not take the heat may still find it too warm after a while. For us it was ok. Check inout was quick and easy. I do not understand why some of the people were complaining about the staff no speaking english. They understand it just fine. No problems there at all. We were given our key wi fi log on details safe key and booklet with resort map. When we got to our room 3090 3rd floor we were positively surprised. Ac was on so it was actually chilly in the room. Smell was not bad. We actually did not notice it in the first place. It took few minutes to notice but it was barerly noticible anyway. In the end it is Caribbean. it is really hothumid outside and cool in the rooms so there always will be some condensation. can not help it. Please remember ac will not work if you will open the balcony door. there is a sign under ac controller explaining that so it is funny to read some people are still surprised. Why would you want to put ac on and then open windows. Pointless. If you want to get some fresh air and keep it cool there is a big celing fan in a room so you can always turn that on. Junior suite is big enough for a couple. First impression really good but you can see wear tear when you look closer. Rooms need tlc and refurbishment but they are kept clean so it was enough for us. We managed to find out that riu properties are having major refurbishments every 10 years or so. Riu Palace meant to have one next year but as they are already booked it will be postponed till 2017. we had love to come back in few years time to see the difference. We did not bother to book for any of the restaurants. We stuck with buffet. Plenty of choices. Food quality was good. Some days better than the others. Waiters were always good and helpful. After they had start recognising you they had keep a table for you that is where the tips come handy. Drinks yes most of them are made from mixes but we have found it good especially when you are spending whole day in a sun. Stronger drinks would hit you early. If you prefer quality alcohol all you need is just ask. They have branded alcohol as part of all inclusive just say exactly what you need. Otherwise you will get local stuff. There is plenty of sun loungers by the pool and on the beach. Some in the direct sun some by the palm trees or with plenty of umbrellas. But if you want a decent spot by the pools get there early before 9 am. There will be plenty left but in the 2nd or 3rd row from the pools. Also towel guys will reserve you preferable spot but they will expect a tip. Both pools are in direct sun all day so in the afternoon water is getting warm. we have found smaller infinity pool cooler as water is constantly overflowing. Hotel stuff keep both pools clean and tidy. As some of the people do not really think about the higene getting to pools straight from sun loungers sweaty and covered in sun creams not bothering to use showers around the pools. sometimes you can see a bit of dirt here and there floating especially in the bigger pool. And yes pool area need tlc too. Some tiles missing but it does not make a lot of difference. Waiters are around the pools all day making sure you are getting your drinks. If you will choose to stick with one of them in the morning tip few dollars you can be sure you will get a great service all day. We have not spent a lot of time on the beach but it is definitely cooler as breeze is usually not getting past palm trees to pool area. Sea weed did not seem to be a big issue. It was definitely better than couple months back. We were talking to locals and they were saying they can not remember having so much sea weed before. In the end we have had a great holiday.

Reading reviews prior to my trip had me wanting to switch resorts. I am so happy I did not. The Riu Palace Punta Cana is a beautiful property with amazing staff. From check in to check out everyone was absolutely amazing. We stayed in a Suite near the pool area which had an amazing pool view and the ocean as the back drop. There was no musty smell the room was clean and was kept clean. Our housekeeper made sure to clean and turn down our room daily. We always had towels available. The property is such a beautiful property. The pool area was always a fun place to lounge and so was the beach. The drinks were great I am not much of a drinker so I can not say much about their alcohol quality. I enjoyed them. Some people mentioned having to go to the bar to get their own drinks. Not sure what the big deal is about that but I often saw bartenders walking around bringing drinks to loungers even at the beach. The only thing I can agree with the other reviewers about is the food. I was not pleased with the food BUT I was ALWAYS able to find something satisfying. There is a huge variety of foods there is no reason why one would not be able to find something to enjoy. We really really enjoyed the Italian restaurant. We also enjoyed our meal at the Fusion Restaurant Krystal. The steakhouse was okay as well. Every staff member we encountered was very pleasant and helpful. The entertainment was funny to watch and very entertaining in my opinion. I think if you are not rolling in on a high horse you will definitely enjoy your stay at the Riu Palace Punta Cana.

The hotel entrance is beautiful to say the least. Check in is the normal process you give personal information etc. We were greeted with an alcohol free fruity drink. The clerk checking us in did not really give us a rundown on need to know details ie. restaurant locations where to get updates on entertainment etc. We did get a map with letters so tiny that you needed a magnifying glass. We ended up discovering things by talking to other guests2The room. The rooms are nothing like the photos. I would say that they were underwhelming at best. Clean most definitely but dated. Electrical outlets 6. Not six doubles but six singles. You may think that is plenty but 2 are in the bathroom and 1 is also hooked to the lights over the curtain. So if you do not mind the Beacon of light while you sleep you are down to 5. Also phone chargers do not want to make connection and nothing gets charged. No problem we called for maintenance. A man shows up with a flat blade screwdriver and procedes to stick the screwdriver into a live outlet to bend the connections. It did not really work but it is what it is. Rooms are energy saving and all lights and outlets are powered by your room card placed into a slot. In theory this is great except when you depart the room you can no longer charge your electronics. The water pressure in the showers is a dream come true. Excellent showers. Toilet rarely flushed on first flush. Often the toilet would be running when we got back to the room and once it overflowed. I mean badly. Used 6 bath towels to sop up the water. Maintenance blamed it on the use of toilet paper. Something to note. do not flush TP but instead toss in garbage can. Yuck3Staf. The entire staff was excellent. Always willing to please and always smiling. 2 employees of note were Sandy Santana our head waiter at the La Isabella Buffet Style Restaurant. He and his crew Ortiz and Marcos were outstanding. Our Room maid Berky Maria Javier was detail oriented. Our Room was spotless and she always had a nice towel animal sitting on our bed. 4Fod. Overall anything meat sucked. They overcooked every piece of meat every single day. The breakfasts were definitely the best. They pretty much had anything that you could think of. The only 24hr restaurant was the Sports Bar. Never ever ever changing the buffet selection of Dried burgers mystery meat hot dogs and kraut petrified breaded chicken strips and stale nachos with cold cheese sauce. 5. The Beach pool. They were never short on pool towels. 3 pools were clean and well maintained. The Beach had plenty of lounge chairs more than enough for everyone. Tons of washed up seaweed that they did not pick up often enough causing that rotting fish smell a couple of times. The waiters on the beach and by the pools were all very gracious and attentive to your needs. Pools close early at 630PM 1830. 6. Entertainment Probably the most disappointing aspect of the resort. If there was any you had to truck on over to the lobby to look at an electronic bulletin board and the message would not tell you the location of the entertainment anyway. 7. Coffee bar This was an afternoon lifesaver for us. After swimming all day having a delicious cup of cappuccino and a delicious dessert really hit the spot8. Spa. The spa services were excellent. The massages are very relaxing9. Airport transportation It was nice after a long flight to not have to touch my bags until I reached my room. We had Amstar who transported to and from the airport. They were professional and courteous. it is worth the extra money for private transportation. The reason is you could be traveling to several hotels before you get to the airport. No use having that anxiety added to your stress. A note about the airport They have no anouncementsso go to your gate and pay attention. If your gate changes nobody tells you. If you are like us you may look forward to a room with an ocean view. Unfortunately if that is the case do not choose The Riu Palace Punta Cana. The horseshoe shaped building only affords a handful of rooms that actually face the ocean. Even if you are able to get one of these few rooms they are so far back from the beach that you are not seeing much.

Food is diverse Many restaurants we did not even visited all of them in a week as we had our favorite which we discovered on the 4th day of our stay everyone should find smth they like. Breakfasts were really good. Lunch is served in a buffet by the beach which is really convenientThe also have a great cafe by reception area there you will find yummy treats for everybody with such a delicious coffee. And last but not least so many choices of cocktails available throughout the day till late night. Loved loved loved our vacation there.

Excellent hotel with high standard service. My husband and I wanted to find a place for vacation with great service good food good hotel beautiful beach with lots of palms and turquoise water. This hotel acceded our expectations. RIU PUNTA CANA is located next other 4 RIU hotels Bamboo Macao Bavaro and Naiboa. We walked around all those hotel and it came out that we made a right choice about where to stay. Some hotels where too crowded others too empty. All staff in RIU PUNTA CANA was so friendly and provided excellent service without pressure about leaving tips. that \u2019s why you want to give the tips. The best resort I have ever stayed so far. About 4 years ago we started at Bahia Principe Punta Cana that was totally different experience was good but not nearly as good as RIU.", "offset": [68, 216], "date": "2020-03-13", "cpt": "1", "category": "general"}]}
