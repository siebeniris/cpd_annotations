This is my first review on TA. I decided before we even took this trip that from this point forward I would start doing reviews. I rely so heavily on the information I read from the reviews that I would be doing a disservice if I did not pass along my own conclusions. So bare with me here I will give you as real a take as I can. We have stayed many places mostly in the Caribbean Sandals Beaches etc. I would consider myself fairly well traveled for the most part if that helps add any validity to my reviews. it is not like this is the first resort we have ever stayed at. Overall this was a very nice resort. I dislike that TA nails you down to a 1 5 rating. I would probably side with a 35 or 375 more so than a 4 but definitely much closer to a 4 than a 3 and most definitely closer to a 5 than a 1 if that makes sense. The resort itself was very nice and clean it does seem somewhat dated but we are not really sticklers. The grounds are beautiful and well kept. The pool seemed very clean and was beautiful as well. The beach is smaller compared to other areas on Kanapali but it is beautiful nonetheless. The location is about as perfect as you can ask with the resort very close to the beach and direct access to Black Rock. We were at the resort 526 61 and it did not seem over crowded despite being sold out. The pool was very nice and has several different depths varying from 3ft8 ft throughout with waterfalls and a lazy river. There are bean bag floats that are somewhat hard to come by during peak hours. There are probably only 8 10 umbrellas around the main pool area which is somewhat cumbersome. We would go out early and place out towels on 2 of the premium chairs under an umbrella. This seemed to be what many people did. The pool staff are routinely walking around and will place a placard on any chairs left unattended for over an hour. You are given towel cards upon arrival and these are your tickets for towels. You get your cards back when you turn in the towels and vice versa. You will be charged for the towels if you do not turn in the cards at check out. It seems like many reviewers did not like this but I guess I can see the practicality in it. You can also rent cabanas by the pool for 45 day which are a nice. The beach is beautiful but can seem crowded since the beach itself is not very large. Every day that we were on the resort there was a fairly constant flow of people swimming out to and jumping off of black rock. there is a fairly constant flow of snorkeling going on in the water as well. I went scuba diving while there and saw a good variety of sea life including sea turtles off black rock. I believe the cost to rent beach chair and umbrella is 30 day I am not positive as we did not personally rent. This is a public beach which bring me to my next point. This is a public beach but It almost seems like a public resort. This is maybe my largest complaint if you call it that. The one constant that my wife and I saw while on the resort was an influx of individuals staying at nearby resorts coming to use the facilities pool beach restaurants etc. This my be common practice I am not sure but I can say definitively that there were a large number of people from other resorts around the pool and on the beach routinely. Take this for what you will 1. A testament that folks staying at other resorts spent their time on this one oppose to their own because they liked it better 2. A pain in the rear that folks form other resorts are on the one you are paying for. You can draw your own inference but as I mentioned we are kind of it is what it is type of people so whatever. The room itself was nice. Nothing special nothing unspecial. We stayed in building 6 which is on top of Black Rock. 4th floor. The view was spectacular and worth every penny that we paid for the Deluxe Oceanfront. The bathroom was large enough for 2 people and had a separate quarter for the toilet. Beds were comfortable by our standards. Balcony was large enough for 2 people and seemed fairly private. We are the type of people that understand we spend maybe 10 of our time while at the resort in the room and 9 of that time is spent in the bed so we do not base too much on the rooms aside form the views. If you are reading this and have the option to do Deluxe Oceanfront. Do it. there is a neat Hot tub that is close to the building on Black Rock We never used it but it would have been a sweet spot to hang out for an hour or two in the evenings. Being on top of Black Rock was awesome and it provided a bit more access to take pictures form that point of view. You can hop a fence and be on top oppose to climbing it from the ocean. Housekeeping was daily and seems sufficient to us. They will change towels and linens every day if you request otherwise it is every 3 days I believe. We never felt like our things were out of place or anything like that. One of the things I saw continually and repetitively when reading reviews prior to our trip was about the difficulty in traversing the grounds one I can understand. From our room on Black rock it took a minimum of 4 elevators or stairwells to get to a point to access the grounds. It was not a big deal for us and we seemed to have it down after a day or so. I can understand the frustrations of many of you though and although it was not a huge turn off for us I can say that the frustrations are not unfounded. If you have a hard time getting around staying on Black Rock would not be a great idea. I would not imagine getting to the grounds from a regular room to be near as difficult or time consuming. Parking is somewhat crowded. Black Rock has a spate parking area so I can not speak to the parking other than on Black Rock. It was typically crowded but we managed. The first day is free 20 day thereafter. I can not speak to the shuttles but I did see them around town some so they are available if you want to go that route. We rented a car I would recommend this myself if anyone is on the fence on the issue. We went with a convertible and were happy that we paid to do so. The resort is about an hour drive from the airport but it is a beautiful drive. The food on the resort was okay I would agree with overpriced but I guess that is to be expected. We ate the breakfast buffet one morning 30 p. Omelets Waffles Fresh Fruit Pasties Bacon Sausage etc. Think your common run of the mill hotel breakfast and add better fruit. The bars near the pool are okay the biggest complaint I have would be the price but we went in knowing that everything is overpriced so I am not sure that is really a relevant complaint. Drinks were good overpriced same applies. One has happy hour from 10a12p the other is from 3p5p most people time their drinking and eating around those times which I understand. Outside of Happy hour you are looking at around 6 8 beer and 10 12 cocktail. The Japanese steakhouse at the resort was very good. Sheraton members get 20 off at resort locations so that could help if you are on budget. The Luau was a good time and I would recommend if you are asking. Food was good Pork Mahi Mahi Chicken potatoes salad pasta salad etc. Open Bar. I believe our tickets were somewhere around 100 p but it was worth it. We went out and ate most of our meals at local places my recommendation as well. The other variable I constantly saw discussed and mentioned as a negative were the resort fees. Obviously there is no way around this one but it is a buzz kill. It encompasses things like Wifi Towels Pool use etc. We knew about the resort fees going into it so it was not like it was a surprise just seems tacky in my opinion. I say just include that into your overall cost but what do I know. The resort Fees and parking fees cost us an extra 300 at checkout for a 5 day stay there. Take it for what it is. The resort offers snorkeling scuba diving cruises excursions etc. Snorkeling is like 8 p for an hour or 20 p for the day not terrible. The location is great for it and I highly recommend. intro scuba was around 120 p and the actual sea time was probably around 30 40minutes. Well worth it in my opinion. Timy was an amazing guide and made the training easy to bare. I can not speak to any of the other options. There is a boardwalk along the beach which makes access to the other resorts easy or vice versa. see above on that one. Whalers village is probably only a 5 minute walk. there is a neat little slush snow cone place about the same distance Bubble Tea Milk Tea whatever that stuff is they have it too. Most reviews seem to compare The Sheraton with The Westin. We walked by The Westin They seem comparable in my opinion. The one conclusion I could draw was that The Westin seemed more crowded and had more children take that for what it is worth. There were kids at The Sheraton just not as many as it seemed at The Westin. What I can also say in confidence is that the other 4 5 resorts we walked by aside form The Westin would not hold a light to The Sheraton or Westin. Side note definitely recommend the trip to Hana. Overall it was an excellent trip. We knew what our cons were going to be coming in and that made them much more painless. In the same breath we knew what the pros were likely going to be we discovered many more pros than cons during our stay. I think that is a big deal for what it is worth. The view from our room was worth the trip in and of itself. The location is unbeatable. Often reading through these reviews I find myself amazed at how unreasonable people can be. You knew there were resort fees you knew there were parking fees you knew the food was expensive. why on earth are you giving a one star review because of those things that you already knew heading in. Again it is what it is. Would I stay here again Absolutely. Is it a value vacation. No by no means. it is far from the type of Luxury Value vacation you get with an all inclusive vacation which is what we are mostly accustomed to. it is Hawaii though and you do not really understand what you are paying for until you get there and actually see Hawaii. it is the most expensive trip we have been on to date the least of a value to date but probably the most beautiful. Take that for what it is worth. Feel free to contact me for any other questions you may have. Like I said I rely heavily on these reviews when trying to nail down plans and get the best bang for our buck that is my intent in reviewing. I would be more than happy to answer any questions or help in anyway I could. I have been the recipient of some really great advise for many of our trips and I would love to be able to help others in that same way.

I had stayed further along Kanapali Beach on a previous trip and loved the hotel and area but the hotel was fully booked and this one was nearby. On arrival following a long flight delay reception staff were very nice. I decided to upgrade our standard room to one of the rooms on the edge of the cliff. And we were not disappointed. We were taken in a small golf cart from reception up to the building where our room was located. The porter took our luggage to the room and not only showed us the room but spent 10 minutes with us looking over the map of Maui explaining the best places to go. He was an avid boarder and swimmer so was able to tell us the best areas to see the marine life and best places to swim. Although rooms were expensive the room we had was in a very quiet area away from the beach but the view was spectacular. It was dark enough to have a good view of the night sky and we could see all the way over to neighbouring islands Molokai. We were also there during the whale season and had spectacular sights of many many whales during our one week trip. We had access to the concierge club for free food and drink and various times of the day. The breakfast was good but dinner was limited. And although drink was free the club area was only open for a couple of hours. Access to the beach was quick and easy and the hotel grounds were beautifully kept. I agree with some other reviews regarding the hotel being a little tired here and there but it did not detract from the overall beauty of the grounds and surrounding scenery.

My wife and I travelled from the UK and stayed in a great Oceanfront Room 4610 for 10 nights from December 23rd the room looked directly along Kanapali Beach and over Black Rock it was modern and had 2 great Lanais it was nice to leave the door of one Lanai open at night and then fall asleep to the sound of the Pacific Ocean waves. The Black Rock restaurant offered great Menus for Breakfast Lunch and Dinner we had Breakfast included in our deal and I would recommend everyone to try and get Breakfast included. Housekeeping was excellent the room was cleaned thoroughly before 10 am everyday. The beach runs directly alongside the hotel and it was great to be able to swim and snorkel in the very warm Pacific Ocean along with the turtles and we even saw Humpback Whales breaching nearby amazing experience. The only negative issues about the hotel would be that the pool water was very cold I am sure the hotel will look to add heating to the pool in due course to make it more welcoming also all sunbeds around the pool were occupied by towels belongings by 8 am each morning the pool staff did their best to manage this situation by placing warning notices on beds that had been unoccupied for a period of time stating that the belongings on them would be removed and safely stored if the bed remained unoccupied for more than 1 hour the sister Westin Hotel has a much better pool offering and would be a preferable property to stay at if you are travelling with young children. The hotel is about a 45 minute journey from Kahului Airport if you do not have a rental car we would recommend using Spedishutle for USD750. The hotel does charge a resort fee of USD3125 per night including tax this fee covers the use of a Resort Shuttle service not Airport shuttle that operates between all SPG properties and also Lahaina Centre this resort shuttle is an excellent service the resort fee also includes wifi throughout the hotel and in the bedrooms.

We were not informed of the strikes that had been occurring for several weeks until we had to drive through the picket lines. Check in was fine and we were told they were waiving parking and resort fees. That goes without saying as there were no resort amenities to be had here due to the strike. Our room was not ready until almost 4 pm and we did not get any housekeeping while we were there due to the strike. Guests were putting towels and trash in hallways attracting bugs and leading to an unpleasant experience for you to walk the hallways especially the carpeted ones. There were no restaurants or bars and no outside food or drink is allowed at the pool. So basically if you get thirsty or hungry lose your pool spot as you are going to have to get dressed and leave the property several times a day for meals. Picketers were using airhorns bullhorns loud stereos and drums on the beach and in front of the hotel keeping any chance at relaxing to a minimum. can not enjoy your balcony or a book by the pool for all the noise. There were no cultural activities aside from the diver at night on black rock and no events luaus. Though how they managed to still hold a taste of maui event is interesting since there were no staff. Guests were not allowed near the event and so most of the guests were trapped in their rooms while that event went on. Without the striking I had give this hotel a 35 or so. it is dated the bathroom is tiny and it has a weird layout but the views from almost all rooms are great and the location on the beach is phenomenal.

I was SO looking forward to staying here the last night of our wonderful trip to Maui but this hotel was a big disappointment. When we pulled into the entrance we had to cross a noisy angry picket line. When we checked in we were informed there was no food available on site and given a list of nearby restaurants. OK not the end of the world there a many lovely places a short walk away and they had a free shuttle running in Kanapali. Then they told us that housekeeping was limited still not a big deal it is just one night we do not really need housekeeping. They upgraded our room to get us away from the noise of the picket line and they did waive the resort fee. I guess as we were standing there in the nearly empty lobby looking at the beautiful ocean none of this seemed so off putting I really just wanted to get to the beach and pool we had driven in from Hana that morning and were just glad to be out of the car. There was no one to help us with our bags and they pointed us back to the car down the driveway towards the mob into the parking garage. From the parking garage we had to take an elevator down cross a walkway to another building another elevator up and then about 100 yards to the room schleping all of our stuff. Not my favorite but still doable. Thing were starting to stack up for me about this experience and I was not too happy at this point. But it was the last night of our vacation and I was trying to make the best of it. THEN we went down to the only bar that was open to get a drink because I was excited about the lazy river. I have never been to one and it looks fun to me. The pool was filthy. It was littered with empty cups and beer cans and around the back of the bar floating on the red raft things we could not get one because they were all taken and we were told first come first served there were a bunch of 20somethings who had decided to BYOB and proudly announced they were not staying there. Their beer cans were all over the side of the river and floating in the water. Yuck. I have nothing against 20somethings I have two of themAs we spoke to other guests it was a mixed bag some had been informed about the strike others had not. I understand that maybe if you booked through a third party the hotel might not know how to reach you. But I booked through the SPG website and at check in was told that my SPG was attached to my reservation. I get email promotions almost daily from SPG they know how to reach me. I take offense to the fact that they did not tell us about this strike ahead of time but had the foresight to tell others. I understand that work stoppages happen and I respect the rights of workers to do so. But let me know so that I may make an informed decision if I want to stay in a place with very limited amenities that forced me to cross a picket line. The hotel has no right to make that decision for me. SPG Mariot has at least 3 other properties on Kanapali beach they could have redirected us and still kept our money. We could have stayed where we were had we known. There were plenty of options and better ways to handle this situation. This business practice is not right. Then they had the nerve to send me a survey and I expressed my displeasure at their bait and switch tactics and the manager responded calling this a learning experience. Shame on you Sheraton Maui.
