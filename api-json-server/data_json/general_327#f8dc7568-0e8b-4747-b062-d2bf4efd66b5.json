We stayed on a Sunday to Wednesday in January and loved being at the La Jola Travelodge. We stayed in the penthouse which is pretty unique for any motel hotel in that it has no shared walls so lots of windows and is surrounded by an expansive lanai. The room and especially the lanai have a distant ocean view that pictures just do not do justice since in a picture your eye is drawn to the clutter of roof tops but when you are actually there they just do not detract much from the enjoyment of the sun shining on the water. And in the other directions you look out over the town to a distant mesa green for us in January. so really you get 270 degrees of nice to really nice view. The back part behind the room has a snarled mess of power lines but it is not the direction you are ever looking in. I can not really believe a previous grumpy. reviewer chose to post a picture of that as representative. it is not. Pros. Clean and neat as a pin Super nice staff especially Dany and Lupita. very welcoming and helpful Convenient location with Bird Rock and Pacific Beach what a crazy youthful scene THAT place is would be great for families with teens. in one direction and La Jola proper in the other direction. Note that the Travelodge is technically in La Jola but not in the main Cove and Shores areas which personally we preferred being away from downtown. It seemed a bit hectic down in those main areas. Quiet ish. you are next to La Jola Blvd which has a fair amount of mellow but steady traffic during the day but the traffic dies back to nothing at night. We were never bothered by the traffic and we live in a very rural quiet area so would have noticed if it were obnoxious. Cool beach and bluffs one short block away. The first night we walked to the beach and along the beach and bluffs all the way to downtown. It was a very nice very beautiful walk with all kind of intriguing rock formations that were sculpted by the ocean. It was low tide would be challenging to do during high tide. Cons The only thing to keep in mind perhaps is that this is not a fancy spa hotel. If you are looking for granite and tile turned down sheets with chocolates on the pillows then keep looking. It is not the place I had want to spent an anniversary or honeymoon or whatnot. But as a home base from which you go exploring and have a really nice place to go back to it is perfect. Neutral.

We had five days at this very pleasant abode. First of all we loved Tricia who greeted us warmly at the reception desk and was always helpful warm profession and fun. A bonus is that she is German. That has to be great for the German guests. The room was comfortable and clean clean clean. Not a fancy room but very adequate with a wonderful bed. Our room number 215 looked out on some palm trees which helped set the mood for our visit. The location was exceptional being so close to a beautiful beach with surfers joggers dog walkers etc. We went down each morning and walked and sat on the benches and read. So many colorful happenings. We loved it. The morning breakfast was better than most because the pastries were exceptional. This was a beautiful find at a very reasonable price.

La Jola Beach Travelodge blew away any expectations we had of it last weekend. Being a budget hotel we did not expect much but we received a ton of value for our money. First off the location is perfect. Only a short 5 minute walk or so to the beach restaurants shopping and anything else you could want. Secondly their customer service is second to none.

The hotel staff were fantastic. They are kind happy and certainly kid friendly. Check in and out was simple. The location was close to the beach.

The continental breakfast was great. Coffee was great. The room was a nice size with a refrigerator microwave and toaster. The only thing I do not recommend is walking around the neighborhood to the La Jola Cove. it is farther than you think and I got the impression that the locals really do not like strangers walking through their neighborhoods. Other than that I would recommend the hotel and will stay here again. There is a washer and dryer located at the pool.

Went to front desk to ask if we could switch rooms and they said the people were checking out that day. Okay fine. Then called to say they asked them to check out early due to the inconvenience. They only had an hour left before they had to check out but I appreciated the gesture. Second and third mornings I discovered room 21 is right next to the cleaning ladies who scream their good morning conversations to each other right in front of our room waking us up in kind of an annoying manner with more screaming and yelling every morning. Cute place but thankfully it \u2019s our last night. If room 21 is offered do n\u2019t take the cleaning staff is in their defense and just doing their job.
