We were given absolutely great service both before and after our visit from the Concierge desk specifically Joan. Not only did she arrange for special welcome gift options but she made sure our hotel receipt promised electronically by the front desk but undelivered was promptly sent to me when I called a few days later to inquire. The staff was friendly up and down the halls no matter who they were or what their role was in the hotel. We had two breakfasts in the main dining area. The meals were excellent though the second morning for whatever reason another couple was seated 2 feet from our table when the entire dining area was available. Needless to say our conversation over breakfast was put to a halt and we left without totally being ready to leave. We utilized the self parking option because the daily cost of valet parking was very steep for our budget. We spent some time out by the pool which was very relaxing and not crowded at all. The wait staff there was attentive though we did not need their services. The golf courses look magnificent though this is not why we came on this particular trip. Perhaps in the future.

Our reservation for a 2night weekend was made directly on Omni Barton Creek Resort Spa website. A comment was made on the reservation page that we would be bringing our pet Yorkie. Upon our late night arrival on day 1 the front desk agent checked us in with an assigned room on the first level. I inquired if a high floor was available and was given \u201c No \u201d as an answer. I proceeded to ask if the hotel had assigned us this room due to having a pet. The front desk agent said \u201c the hotel is full \u201d which is unlikely due to the construction and noticeably very low foot traffic within the hotel. Not thrilled but life goes on and we accepted the blanketed answer of the hotel being full. We ordered a drink with our room service but were later called back that the drinks could not be made because they ran out of mint leaves. How do you run out of a common garnish used for various dishes and drinks \u2013 in a hospitality operationOur room was dated and the glimmer of light at the end of the tunnel is the hotel is under construction in hope that one day they can justify their high price points. The hotel is much like a maze. Two of the restaurants were located downstairs that more resembles a basement out of site and out of mind. The lobby is small and enclosed creating an uninviting environment. There are several small crevices of hallways with one off seating that you can contemplate the meaning of life or why you had spent this much money to stay here. The 27 breakfast buffet was acceptable. A self serve open juice dispensers or pitchers would be a great addition. Day 2 as we left our room around 1015AM to get breakfast in the hotel our pet Yorkie stayed behind in the room. Our beloved Yorkie barked as we left the room as he would do for a few minutes each day when we leave home for work. We came back from breakfast about an hour later and took our Yorkie for a car ride throughout the afternoon. As we were away we had received an email from the hotel operator with a subject line of \u201c ABOUT DOG IN ROOM \u201d. The email was ALL CAPS IN THE SUBJECT LINE AND BODY OF TEXT. The front desk supervisor was also copied on this email. After noticing the email we had received I called the hotel operator directly. The discussion begun with a guest next door had complained about our Yorkie barking when we had left for breakfast. The operator suggested that we did not notify the hotel of us bringing a pet. I corrected the operator and told him we had noted in the reservation that we would be bringing a pet Yorkie. Additionally I advised him that the front desk agent at check. in clearly saw our pet and did not provided any policies relating to pets. I asked if any actions are required from us or if they wanted to move us to mitigate issues going forward. The operator said \u201c Nothing needs to be done at this time \u201d and both sides ended the phone call. Let me suggest a few fundamental customer service basics. First do not use all CAPS in emails. Second do not make assumptions that something was not done prior to verifying your records. Third as a courtesy and professionalism call and leave a voice message at the hotel room and follow up with an email if the matter is that urgent for multiple follow ups. Processes and actions of employees are only effective when leadership and management adhere to high goals and standards to achieve world class service.

I must say they seem to have gotten their wheels well oiled by year end overall operations and the staff were great. This is my second time staying at the Omni Barton Creek the first time was a couple years back before the renovations were underway. I must say I am highly impressed with the transformation looks entirely different. From the tastefully designed landscaping to an interior flushed with natural tones woody earthy accents and beautiful floral themed artwork. I really can not believe I have raving reviews for an Omni brand because I have had terrible experiences with Omni in the past and have kept well away from their hotels because of that. Barton Creek may change my mind. The rooms were clean and spacious comes with a mini fridge a safe modern rainfall shower I had a west facing room great for catching the sunset. During check in I asked to be relocated to the new tower based on comments on here it is the closest to the front concierge and just steps away from the spa. The spa was the highlight of my stay a very well done facility clean relaxing and with highly skilled therapists. One thing to note is that you will be charged a mandatory service fee at 20 of your services I was a little confused if that was an applied tip or if I needed to include gratuity but the receipt did not include an option for that. The resort seemed pretty empty which I liked but I can see this quickly becoming a Texas favourite in the near future. There is typically a schedule of activities each day especially if you are into health and fitness beware that most of them come with an additional charge so ask about those charges as the cost is not listed on the sheet. They have a full guym with weights and cardio machines and serves a a health club also for non guests. There are several restaurants in the hotel most were closed I guess due to low volume of guests post holiday season. I had a little situation at the breakfast restaurant but the hostess handled it all professionally and even compd my breakfast. One complaint is that there was not a buffet breakfast I wished we were told that during checking I was really looking forward to that. Also they could do a better job with the jogging trail there is so much beauty within the grounds that a road side jogging trail just seems like an after thought and is just unsafe.

I was told that it would be 5 10 minutes before I received it. I did not see those bags for 3 hours. I called the front desk who assured me it WAS delivered and even asked to COME INTO MY ROOM to verify they were not there. I then heard staffers knocking on my neighbors doors to see if my belongings were in those rooms. I was honestly in shock. They returned about 20 minutes later bags in tow proclaiming it was delivered to a completely different floor. That was interesting but now I am literally begging the front desk to bring my materials that I shipped to the hotel in advance. I have done this for every conference attended and never had an issue retrieving my items from their storeroom. I have asked SIX TIMES not an exaggeration for my items to be brought to my table. One is a TV. It is now conference day 2. I was unable to set up my table as planned due to the luggage debacle and now I do not event have my TV that I shipped in advance. I am so incredibly disappointed in this Omni property and urge anyone thinking of using this venue for a conference to think twice. They are not equipped to manage large groups.", "offset": [1329, 1457], "date": "2020-02-25", "cpt": "2", "category": "reception"}]}
