We received a warm welcome and excellent service from the bell staff who were most accommodating especially considering that we had a very stressful day due to our travel issues.

Second while our room was perfectly adequate and comfortable in all respects I was distressed to awaken the next morning with several itchy bug bites on many locations on my body. I do not know the cause of this irritation but it was most uncomfortable. I did report the matter to the hotel staff who immediately put me in touch with Mariot corporate customer service. They listened to my complaint and took immediate action to advise the hotel to address the possible cause of the problem. I give Mariot credit for taking this matter seriously and for not denying or diminishing the veracity of my complaint. We ate only one meal breakfast in this hotel.

Best to formulate your own opinion. Sadly arrived home last night from a 6 night stay. We wanted to stay. I have been reading reviews ever since booking in June of 17 and had much worry about how this property would be after reading all of the negativity. I have learned that each person had their own experience and could not base my opinion on theirs. We had an Oceanfront Room that was amazing. Could not beat the views. The room was large and very clean. The Bathroom was on the smaller side but the second separate sink and vanity made up for it. The water pressure was great and the bathrooms were clean. My Husband and I had plenty of room to get ready for our days. The bed and pillows were so plush and comfortable it made for a wonderful place to lay your head away from home. Our Lanai was large and private and provided a wonderful place to watch the sunrise. The room had a Mini Fridge in which we utilized for drinks and snacks during our stay. We stocked up at the local Safeway Long Drugs both within walking distance to save a few dimes on the food drink around the island. We found the room to be quiet and could not hear anything but the ocean waves. During our stay we did end up renting a car to explore the island. I would recommend renting a car if you wish to explore. We drove from one end to the other and saw many beautiful areas and attractions. If you are planning to stay close to the beach and hotel a car is not necessary. You can walk to Safeway Long Drugs many restaurants Coconut Marketplace and Old Town Kapa. The hotel is very centrally located on the island. We spent many nights out at the pool area where we were allowed to bring our own drinks and relax with a borrowed cooler from the Front Desk. There were also nights when we hung out at the Hotel Bar Restaurant listening to nightly music. I felt the prices were not any higher than surrounding restaurants and actually had much better food. I think I had the Edemame and Coconut Prawns at least 3 4 times during the stay both are on happy hour might I add. They were so godI want to commend James Evely for being gracious enough to have a special treat delivered to our room and the rooms of to other couples we were traveling with as we celebrated my husbands Retirement. our friends Vow Renewal and another couples first time to Hawaii and the Officiant over the renewal. I began emailing James early on in our journey to ensure that the reviews I was reading were not true. He assured me that all would be perfect and it truly was. Now only if he could have stopped the rain it did rain EVERYDAY most of the day. as there was a storm system going through. Other than not coming home with a tan our stay was truly everything we expected and would definitely stay at this hotel again. I would also like to commend the staff of the hotel. Everyone was so friendly and helpful. The daily maid service was consistent and performed their job really well. We were always stocked with clean towels and a clean room. The staff at the bar restaurant were also very friendly. We were able to joke a bit with them and had a great time. I can not leave out the ladies at the front desk they were also very helpful in explaining the hotel services to us as well as suggest places to go and things to see. Overall our stay and our experience at this hotel proved all of the negative reviews comments wrong. It truly is based on your personal experience and outlook of situations. We could not have asked for more on such a vacation.", "offset": [1861, 1962], "date": "2018-02-28", "cpt": "1", "category": "price"}, {"id": 11, "uid": "e77b0a9b-2cd5-46e7-ac88-5a639dcb0e2d", "sentence": "Third stay was disappointing. My fianc\u00e9 and I have stayed at Courtyard Kauai Coconut Beach twice before. We had initially found it appealing due to the reasonable price and the central location of the hotel to the island. The first two times we were given a warm welcome and loved the ocean view room. The decor and physical state of the room were dated but the rooms were well taken care of and clean. We stayed for 8 days and enjoyed our Mai Tai \u2019s by the pool in the evening after exploring the island during the day. The daily resort fee always seemed a bit pricey but included 1 free Mai Tai per person per night. The pool is relaxing as is the hot tub especially since it is so close to the ocean. The only problem that we ran into the during these two trips 2015 2016 was we had a difficult time finding a dryer that worked which we needed before our flight to avoid wet swim suits in our bag. Our 2017 trip to the hotel was very disappointing in comparison. We were still greeted kindly upon arrival. We spent the bulk of our time exploring and enjoying the island but we we noticed that the beds were not as comfy as the previous trips and the room and hotel were definitely showing more wear and tear then previously. Also the daily resort fee remains the same however now only includes one free Mai Tai per person for the entire stay. We also noted that although you pay a nightly parking fee finding a place to park is almost impossible the nights they have the onsite Luau. This is unacceptable. Overall the price of the hotel continues to rise as the quality of the hotel has decreased. We will be returning to kauai this summer but will be staying at a more accommodating and updated retreat. The two most upsetting parts of our stay helped us in realizing that the hotel was not worth another visit. The hotel has a number of tables in a common area near the pool away from the restaurant. We had previously eaten dinner in the area with takeout from local restaurants. During our most recent trip a waitress approached us and asked us \u201c What are you doing at My table \u201d. She then shared that we were not allowed to have outside food at Her restaurant. Startled my fianc\u00e9 noted that this table was open and due to its \u2019 close proximity to common spaces we had assumed that it was not a part of the restaurant. In a very negative and loud voice the waitress said \u201c These are my tables and you can only sit at my tables if you are going to order from me \u201d. At this point everyone at the pool and other tables were all facing us and watching. We decided it was not worth arguing and took our dinner to our room. It should be noted that the waitress stood next to the table with her arms crossed and waited for us to leave. We found this to be upsetting and did not return to the restaurant for the remainder of our stay. The final event that turned us away from the hotel was on our third to last day of our stay. We were getting ready for bed and my fianc\u00e9 could n\u2019t find his prescription Oakley glasses. We looked everywhere for about an hour and they were no where to be found. We called guest services and let them know and they apologized and said they would check the lost and found. They were very kind and let us know that they did n\u2019t find anything but would call if they did. We called the last day just to see especially because they were expensive but were told nothing showed up. It should be noted that he never removed the glasses from the room. Our housekeeper was very sweet but perhaps the glasses were removed with bedding and the glasses were lost. The last few days at the hotel were disappointing and we left with a negative experience of the hotel. Although we have positive memories of our first stay the final trip was too upsetting to want to return to Courtyard Kauai.", "offset": [3299, 3405], "date": "2018-04-14", "cpt": "1", "category": "price"}, {"id": 12, "uid": "466ecdd5-c17c-4231-816c-015f91ae5149", "sentence": "Dated property Aloha spirit.
