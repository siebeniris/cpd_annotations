Check InOur party arrived at Raffles at 10am ish of course the room was not ready we were expecting this however we were told the rooms would not ready until after 4 even though their normal check in is 2 pm. Despite discussion with the clerk checking us in there was no offer of anywhere to freshen up before the day exploring Singapore. It was only after I asked that the offer was made for a key to let us up to the pool changing area. The clerk who was checking us in while polite was very mechanical and lacked any real warmth. We had two rooms reserved and despite asking for them to be charged to two different credit cards my amex statement is telling me that they failed to do so. We got our complimentary Singapore Sling while the check in process was completed which was tasty. The Suites We had basic courtyard suites. while yes very beautiful in a historical context they are now dated and not in a good way. Our bathroom in suite 236 was really showing its age the continuous waterfall sounds radiating from the toilet set a relaxing tone throughout the suite. The paint flaking from the ceiling provided a touch of a white christmas in the heat of Singapore. All this while a 17 inch 1990s original TEAC square television ensured entertainment was supplied in the bedroom. I also noticed that our other suite got more amenities in the bathroom than we did. The beds while comfortable were comfortable in the same way that an old day bed at your Grandmas house is comfortable its seen a lot of guests and has conformed to those different shapes and sizes but could now be happily put out for retirement without it being a great loss. The butler service One of the key elements associated with Raffles was in a word disappointing. The first time I pushed the service button Raffles do nt give any phones that have a button to call the front desk or concierge just a service button which is meant to prompt a butler to come to your room resulted in a quick phone call to the room we were told someone would come to the room when the button was pressed not that I really want that but found the call strange when we were told else. The other couple of times pressing the button took so long that I ended up cancelling the call and walked to reception for the answers. The Dining and BarsWe visited The Long Bar simply for its historical value while yes a Singapore institution it was also the biggest tourist trap ever our friends who were staying in other hotels ended up being triple charged resulting in a long argument while it was sorted out even then no apology was offered. We had breakfast included in the Tipin Room which was delightful and a highlight of our stay. We also had lunch at Ah Tengs bakery which was tasty and also not a meal that would require a second house loan compared to the other establishments onsite. The PolThe pool was a beautiful tranquil oasis and a lovely temperature despite lacking anything mind blowing in terms of design or style. Check OutWe requested late check out and got 2 pm which satisfied us to have a swim and enjoy some more time by the pool. We fell asleep by the pool which resulted in us waking up at 155 we rushed back to our room in order to shower and change however at 205 we got a call which pretty much demanded us to get out. I informed the caller that we would be 10 minutes and could they send a bell boy for the luggage. No bell boy appeared and it took a second call to get someone there delaying us to leave the room even further if they were in such a rush to take it back they should of been helping us get out. As our flight was not until much later in the evening we asked them to store our bags. I was upset to find that they just place the bags in an open to the elements patio off the main courtyard. It was not secure at all and to be frank it was not even really in eye sight of the bell boys who were caught up in taking care of the taxi lines. I actually walked into the area to place something in my bag that I had purchased when I could not get the attention of the bell boys. I informed the clerk checking us out about the issues in our room however she did not seem to care. Overall glad I have ticked it off the bucket list but I wo nt be rushing back and will be sticking to the Fairmont across the road its a lot better value.", "offset": [2881, 3019], "date": "2015-01-22", "cpt": "0", "category": "pool"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "30df0dbb-a100-4587-af99-5768cda94a93", "sentence": "Timeless.

There are plenty of other hotels and hotel rooms can be a bit of a muchness. Raffles is not. With the refurbishment I really do hope they keep the essence of the hotel as it is. The rooms are large and comfortable the bed I had was enormous. The bath was also huge and although I did not take up on the offer for the butler to run a spa bath for me perhaps I should have. The old fashioned baths need time to warm up so do not hop straight in. You need to adjust to calmer times. Raffles is a great hotel for doing nothing. Which was perfect for my trip I wanted 3 days doing nothing. I had a leisurely breakfast and the eggs Benedict are great there is fruit and heaps of pastries all fabulous. Then I stretched out by the pool which is wonderful and although you can hear the refurbishment works it is not vastly different to the sounds of the city it did not bother me. I did wander across to the Marina for the light show and had a quick look in the shops but nothing too strenuous. Supper in the grill was fine and the curry buffet was great.

Of course the floor is littered with peanut shells. It makes me wonder about the larikin ruffian travellers of years gone by that had a laugh when they stayed at Raffles. It also reminds me of a cowboy bar in San Antonio Texas which was the first place that I experienced a bar floor littered with peanut shells.

Booked afternoon tea with my family as a last treat before leaving Singapore. I travel there regularly and have been waiting for it to reopen for over a year.

Gentlemen are encouraged to wear shirt and trousers teamed with appropriate covered toes footwear. Ladies may be dressed in their casual best dresses skirts or trousers with appropriate footwear toes covered shoes or heels. No shorts open toes shoes or sandals pool attire is not permitted. As we were there on holiday and my son only had smart shorts with him I called to check that this would be OK. I was told its OK for children but a 15 year old risked being turned away. We therefore went out and bought smart chinos for the occasion at not an inconsiderable cost. I was then horrified to see the standard of dress allowed in the Grand Lobby. At least 4 adult men were wearing shorts. Many were in jeans and trainers. A few also in Birkenstock type sandals and t shirts. No one was turned away as I had been told. When I complained we were offered an apology and given extra desserts to take home. Half of these contained nuts which we could not eat due to allergies. I wish I had asked for the cost of the chinos bought that morning back instead. Really disappointing.

However three were disappointing lows which unfortunately really tarnished the overall experience primarily the room not being available to check in until 530pm despite me calling in the morning and being told it would be ready at 2 pm. When you are arriving for a 1 night special occasion and have a nice plan of how you will spend your afternoon and evening being made to wait in the courtyard and effectively lose the afternoon by the pool made it a stressful and very disappointing start. In order to still get to enjoy some time by the pool it meant I had to cancel our dinner reservations for 830pm at a fabulous Michelin star French restaurant. This was not the Raffles experience I was expecting and a free glass of champagne hardly softened the blow. The staff were all very courteous and considerate but it felt like they lacked depth of knowledge about the hotel and the operating procedures.

We were returning from Europe following a 3 month vacation and wanted to stop over in Singapore a few days to re adjust our body clocks closer to Australian time. Having previously stayed at Raffles Singapore and Dubai we expected nothing but the best. The extensive and recently completed renovations have been done thoughtfully and to be honest at least to our eyes have not changed the ambience of character of the hotel. Our room a State Room King Suite was opulent large and perfect for our stay. The smoke pollution from the Indonesian fires were at dangerous levels over the period of our stay providing even more reason to utilise all the facilities at the hotel. Room service was great with a wide choice of meals and the breakfast included in our tariff was world class standard. Our only negative comment would be the 10 service fee charged to anything everything at the hotel. An example would be the room charge at SD973 had an 10 service fee of SD9730 and then the Government tax of 7. If you ordered a coffee by the pool from the Nespreso machine. the cost was SD16 including service charges and tax making it the equal most expensive Capri Italy coffee on on trip. To be fair the booking information does state clearly plus service fees and Government charges. but as these are known and fixed there is a reasonable argument for the Hotel to state the full cost for example the State Room SD113841 per night including all charges. Over a four days the extras start to add up and if you are budgeting that extra SD16541 a day starts to count. We also stayed the week leading into the Singapore F1 event so other prices were likely inflated. The chafeur pick up was included in our tariff SD75 but to book a return trip it was SD210 we chose a taxi for SD40 which was just as fine to be honest. The Spa previously located near the pool is now situated downstairs in the Raffles Arcade. We did not use it this time and our only comment would be that he location is not as convenient as polside and within the hotel. Pros.
