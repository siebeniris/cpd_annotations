Room was clean and quiet staff friendly and always helpful. Easy walk to the beach and good restaurants. We would happily book a room here on a return to La Jola. Not a new or upscale property but a quiet neighborhood motel.", "offset": [0, 25], "date": "2015-04-07", "cpt": "0", "category": "family"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "712ba731-762c-4ee9-9b3b-4ace7c1f1860", "sentence": "Another great stay. My wife and I needed a quick getaway and this has quickly become one of our favorite spots. The staff are very cordial and friendly. Lupita greeted me on check in and even remembered me and my wife even though we only stayed there once before. Check in was painless and quick. We even asked for a late check out which they gladly accommodated. The room is more than basic and has a microwave mini fridge and safe. All items were clean and well arranged and we felt instantly at ease upon entering the room. The hotel is in a quiet area of La Jola and only about 15 blocks from the beach. After check out we took a 1 minute drive to the beach and watched the surfers ride some pretty great waves. All in all it was a very relaxing one night stay. We highly recommend this location. If you are looking for 4 star acomodations definitely look elsewhere. there is plenty of 30night hotels in the area. But if you are looking for a clean friendly hotel at an affordable price stay here. we are glad we did.

Friendly family atmosphere. The hotel staff were very nice and helpful. I had a package delivered via FEDEX to the front desk and the manager signed for it and made sure I received it.
