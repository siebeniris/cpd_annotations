I had stayed here years ago on a business seminar but came back recently with a friend who was visiting from out of state. The Vintage Inn is ideally situated within walking distance of several fine restaurants French Laundry Bistro Jeanty Bouchon etc and boutique shopping. It is also within an easy drive to the various small towns and wineries. We arrived a bit early but that was not a problem our room was ready. The room itself was very spacious with two comfortable queen size beds a table and side chairs a large over stuffed reading chair and a beautiful fireplace all ready to go. We had a closet as well as an armoire so there was plenty of room to hang our clothing. The bathroom was huge with two sinks and a large spacious tub shower. We had clean linens every day and the housekeeping staff kept our room immaculate. The gardeners are amazing and the grounds surrounding the rooms are kept in perfect condition with flowers everywhere. The rooms must be well insulated because we never heard a sound from the adjoining rooms. The breakfast is quite sumptuous with a buffet of fresh fruit various cereals pastries juices breads and spreads. Outside on the patio a chef is prepared to make hot egg dishes try the omelets they are amazing. In the afternoon there is a tea service with lemonade and ice tea along with various cookies cakes and little sandwiches. You will definitely not go hungry. The staff at the front desk are helpful friendly and efficient. They went out of their way on several occasions to answer questions and give advice. I have stayed in hotels all over the world and this was one of the most pleasant experiences I have had. We were in room 210 which was on the ground floor conveniently located near the lobby and dining area.

My sisters and I have stayed annually at the Vintage Inn for the past 27 years and travel from all over the West Coast to gather.

We missed the typical selection at breakfast. Missing were cheeses dried fruits egg salad and an alternate to the omelette bar typically breakfast burritos or hash. Once upon a time there were also wine poached pears. The afternoon tea used to include small savory sandwiches and on this stay only cookies small pastries were supplied. We could get a cup of coffee or tea any time of the day and that was not an option this year. In all previous years the wine glasses and fire log in our rooms have been replaced daily with new which did not occur this year. Our rooms had already been renovated but screws fell out of the bathroom vanity cabinet when doors were opened and the switch plates for the lights were not secured to the wall.

Like many we appreciate the wonderful food people and atmosphere that make this town a gem in the heart of the Napa valley. The Vintage Inn held a special place in our hearts as a centerpiece in our experiences here and this review is as much an epitaph for what was as it is a complaint about what is. The hotel used to be a beautiful property with a sort of French countryside feel. Fresh lavendar growing and beautiful flowers leading up to the lobby. The rooms were charming muted and tasteful. I found our renovated room to be gaudy and tastelessly decorated with cheap looking modern furniture out of place against the natural tone of the hardwood floors. The sanguine notes of Vivaldi in the lobby have been replaced with brash and out of place hip hop music at an elevated volume. Gone is the welcoming and civilized classical music and impressionist paintings on the television after turn down service. The hotel used to set out a free bottle of wine in the room and some nice espresso and cream. Now there is SERIOUSLY wait for it. Coffee Mate to go with your espresso and upcharged bottles of booze set out for consumption. Wow how luxurious and refined. Forget the subtleties of wine tasting and fine food hand me that bourbon bottle and get down to business. How about a nice shot of espresso. Ah but wait lets add some coffee mate to remind you that you never really escaped the corporate money crunchers back in the city. that here too the bean counters rule the choice of coffee condiments forcing you to choke on liquid rubber instead of sipping some honest cream or half and half. Perhaps the bourbon is profered for a fee as a sort of gargle to get rid of the taste of the chemical creamer. One may never know what evil lurkes in the shadows of corporate board rooms when such decisions are made. We were looking forward to observing the changes in decor and were sorely disappointed. Tacky is the best adjective I can conjure. Once settled in to the room we noticed the tub was stained with dirty water and the jets appeared to have mold like stains. gross. Apparently in the haste to finish all the renovation no one bothered to clean our bath tub. Priorities. Toiletries used to be lOcitane. now some brand I have never heard of flowers in the front of the property replaced with lifeless twigs almost a perfect allegory for the death of the soul of this place. A resort fee is now assessed so be prepared to pay alot more than the advertised price for the room. No omelette bar anymore. Ah no stone or egg left unturned by the bean counters. If I did not know how great this place could be in fact how great it was then these aforementioned affronts might not bother me so much but alas I was here when word of mouth meant something when business seemed built on trust and repeat business rather than bloated reputations one time visits from foreigners and mass advertising. In summary I observed nothing in my last experience that justifies the exorbitant fee to stay there compared to the days of yore. I am shaking the dust off my feet and moving on.

No bar or restaurant on premises have to go to sister property 3 blocks away or wait 30 minutes for staff to fetch. Concierge planned nice day for us in vineyards which was very much appreciated thumbs up on that. All in all fine property and experience but for 140 for 2 nights in their entry room category it \u2019s very expensive for what you get.", "offset": [0, 47], "date": "2019-07-06", "cpt": "2", "category": "general"}, {"id": 28, "uid": "0d400def-6c43-4aeb-809b-ae244969f37f", "sentence": "Quaint hotel that needs more amenities. Vintage House is a solid 35 giving 3 since I can not give 05 stars. Location is great for wine tasting. Many high end restaurants are within walking distance. St Helena and downtown Napa are short drives for more casual less expensive eateries. The hotel breakfast was good. Since it was not specified as continental we expected more hot items for breakfast. For the cost of the room complimentary water bottles in the room during our stay should be standard. Overall the room was clean but we can see dust cobwebs on high fixtures. We had to ask housekeeping to replace the sheet since there was a stain. Housekeeping also did not empty the waste basket or take away the bottles we left on the side for recycling. The bed pillows were uncomfortable. They were very soft and worn despite asking for firm for both during booking. This unfortunately resulted in restless sleep. we had go back if they get new firm beds and pillows with more amenities for the price. FYI the fitness center is not on the premise and the bar is at their sister hotel a few blocks down.", "offset": [755, 790], "date": "2019-07-27", "cpt": "2", "category": "general"}, {"id": 29, "uid": "5f626e98-a850-447f-90e7-42a030d9d6ba", "sentence": "Nice but definitely not worth the cost. This was our first stay here. Stayed at Vilagio Inn in the past. Valet staff wonderful. Front desk staff knew their job but not helpful with questions beyond check in and check out inquiries. Breakfast buffet was great. Rooms nice but cobwebs everywhere and the tub shower in our room was VERY difficult to get in and out of safely and was also very slippery. Pool area was well maintained. Have visited spa several times in the past. Good and bad experiences. Website states it has been upgraded but see little change in spa and they do n\u2019t offer some services we have enjoyed previously. Was cleaner than last time which is a plus but was pretty quiet there for a Saturday morning. Even so they were unable to accommodate our friend when THEY made a scheduling mistake. Upon arrival at 910 they told one of our friends his appointment was for 90 and he was late. We are 100 certain we made all of our appointments for 100 at the same time. They could n\u2019t reschedule him until 10 which did n\u2019t work. even though his wife had canceled her 100 am apt the night before due to illness. There should have been an availability. It \u2019s a beautiful property overall and we LOVE Yountvile but we will try another hotel and spa next time.", "offset": [630, 723], "date": "2019-09-05", "cpt": "2", "category": "general"}]}
