My boyfriend and I absolutely love this hotel. The staff was friendly and had great customer service. The room was to die for. It had a beautiful vintage nautical theme. The room was clean and spacious. It had an amazing view of the bay. I love they had a table outside with two chairs out on your patio. It was relaxing to sit outside and enjoy the view.

My partner and I planned a last minute getaway for our anniversary and the Waterfront Hotel was the right choice. The location was perfect easy drive to the Oracle Arena with beautiful views of the water. Upon our arrival we were offered a room upgrade to celebrate our anniversary and Ime was very helpful to let us know what the hotel had to offer which included a wine and cheese hour. There are plenty of restaurants in the area but we had limited time before the game so we chose to order room service. We had the Margarita pizza and the half chicken SO yummy.

We chose the Waterfront Plaza because we were going to be attending a class reunion and the location for the event was perfect. We arrived Friday 826 at 10PM and were pleasantly surprised that our room was ready. We were checked in by Ime who was very helpful even though she was the only one on the front desk and the phones were a bit hectic. Even with that she was polite cheerful and we were checked in quickly. Pablo met us in the lobby with our luggage. We gave him our room number and he said he would meet us there. The room we were assigned was very nice and quite large however it did not have a balcony. We were going to be staying 2 nights and thought a balcony would really make our stay that much more special. We called Ime and asked if there were any balcony rooms available. She said she would check and call us back. In the mean time Pablo arrived with our luggage. We told him what we were trying to do. No problem. While the 3 of us waited for Ime to call back we chatted and found out that Pablo is a very nice polite and professional young man who really seems as though he enjoys his job. I called down to Ime a second time. She was still busy but assured me she would check and call back. Pablos shift was due to end at 20 and he really wanted to get us settled before that time came. He called down to Ime and then volunteered to go down to the front desk to see what he could find. In a short time Pablo called and said that room 304 was available and had a balcony. He said he would show it to us so we could make sure it was what we wanted so we all met at room 304. The room was perfect and it had a nice large balcony overlooking the harbor and the pool. He brought our luggage to the room and got us all settled. Then I went down to the front desk to exchange keys. Now Lanika sp had joined Ime at the desk and had our room keys. She was very nice and asked if we were happy with the room. I assured her it was perfect. The rest of the weekend whenever we passed the front desk or the valet bellman area we were greeted and treated warmly. Upon departure on Sunday we were pleased to see that Ime Lanika and Pablo were all there. They all once again made sure that our stay was a good one which it was. Thanks so much for taking such good care of. See you soon.

I would be lying if i said things did not start out smoothly the certainly did. I had landed early in San Francisco around 115 in the morning and having to be somewhere for work I called the hotel to see if I could potentially check in Early. To my surprise a room was available for me I get to the hotel and check in for what was supposed to be a 12 day stay. Now I had called two or three weeks in advance and had spoken with someone from the hotel to book the reservation AND confirm what exactly the penalties for an early departure might be. I was informed that the penalty for an early checkout was One 1 additional nights stay. After the booking I called back again now 2 days away from my reservation and still before the breaking the hotels 48 hour window cancellation policy just to confirm that the reservation was still there and that the penalty was only One additional nights stay. I informed the hotel at that time that I was not sure if it was more beneficial for me to make one long reservation or if making a few short ones would be more better for me because I knew that I could potentially be checking out early. With my line of work I know very well that I may be called at any moment to leave the country. I am a Merchant Mariner that works for the United States Government regularly tasked with making sure that our Troops domestic and abroad have their equipment delivered on time and at the right destination. I was advised by hotel staff to keep the reservation for the long trip and that only a one nights stay would be my penalty for checking out early. Well on the following Monday Day 5 of my stay I was called to report to a ship that was overseas and that I would be leaving Monday night Tuesday Morning. I went to the front desk Checked out and was handed a printed receipt balance paid in full and was on my way. See Photos. A Day later After a little back and fourth Via text messaging I was informed that I would be charged for the entire length of my stay due to the Special Rate I had received. I responded that this did not seem accurate and they did not have the AUTHORIZATION to charge my card I did n\u2019t hear back from the hotel at all about this they simply decided that it was unimportant to answer my response \u2026 mind you this was ALL via text messaging \u2026 very professional. To my surprise two days later after LOCKING my card down there is a pending charge for significant dollar amount more. I called the credit card company to dispute the charge. After speaking with the claims department the person asked if I would be willing to do a conference call with the hotel to see if we could possibly orchestrate a refund I agreed was put on hold and when the claims rep came back on the line after having tried to call the hotel She explained to me that she was bounced around and put on hold numerous times and when finally linked to someone in the accounting department they picked up and hung the phone up on her. We processed the dispute right then and there. To this day I have continuously been bombarded with text messages and emails from this establishment bordering on harassment after I have tried to opt out of these messaging services. I hope that although this write up was long it sheds some light on the way that the Waterfront hotel conducts its business. They believe in handling things via text message and when confronted feel it is ok to hang up on people. This indicates to me that it is n\u2019t the first time they have done this. Maybe this is how they feel members of our military and those that help them should be treated. None the less it was all childish and could have been avoided ultimately changing my whole perspective on the place.

I opted for the sea view which encompasses not only Jack London Square it \u2019s located in the middle of it just a few feet from the sculpture of the famous author but the ocean Alameda distant San Francisco. On Friday early evening to the weekends the sea view allows you to take in the three day festivities festooned with tents shops street food American Creole Soul dancers music the energy of people. The rooms are equipped with the standard fare but there is a nice dorm room sized refrigerator hidden in the cabinet beneath the large screen TV37 \u201d or larger. Next to it is your safe large enough for laptops other items. Below the safe is a 4dreser drawer ensemble. Two bottles of Kala Springs water is delivered daily. The bed is comfortable but I lounged watching TV on the large sofa as well. A circular dining table is positioned by the windows which can be opened enough to lean out taking in the nice sea breeze the aromas of a pizzeria just across the walkway the foods being prepared enjoyed outdoors from the hotel \u2019s Lungomare Restaurant Tuscan style Scott \u2019s Seafood Kincaid \u2019s Fish Chophouse restaurants the latter two walking distance.
