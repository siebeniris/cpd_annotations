We had the opportunity to stay at this amazing resort last week during spring break April 1 April 5I am going to write this review on how on would like to see reviews written. Arrival You drive up to this resort and immediately think your in paradise. They greet you immediately and your off to the front desk in no time. The employees generally care about how comfortable you are with your stay. Check in flawless. They take the time to make sure you know exactly where you are going and do not rush you even if there is a line. Bellmen Top notch. Escort you to your room and take time to make sure you know how everything works in your room and again do not rush you. Get you ice and leave with a smile and enjoy your stay with us. Rooms. So clean. No black feet in these rooms. Beds Clean and oh so comfortable. Lots of pillows and just the right amount of blankets. Room Temperature First resort that I stayed in where the room temperature was perfect at all times. AmazingResort Words can not express how gorgeous this resort is. You have to stay here. They have left nothing untouched. They have thought of everything. You have to see it to believe it. The building blends into the beach scenery. The grounds are impeccable. So much lush vegetation and flowers put in all the right places. Seriously everyone this place is not to be missed. They have outdoor sitting in all the right places fire pits that glow all over the resort do not miss making a smore with your family in one of the several fire pits around the resort employees saying hello to you every time you pass one by just the right amount of stores everyone you can find just what you need Starbucks their own bridge that lends you to the ocean for what is one of the most amazing sunsets you will ever see ok maybe except for Hawaii but did I mention at this resort you feel like your in hawaii. the most beautiful fountains all over the resort for that one of a kind family photo the list can go on and on. Pools so clean can you say saltwater so. good. Hot tubs three of the most beautiful hot tubs set in this lush grotto with the most comfortable chairs and plenty of extra clean towels to soak up the last of the afternoon warm california sunshine or catch a early morning sunrise. Food It is so good. I never like to eat at resorts because all the food tastes the same. NOT at this resort. Let me pick out a few. The breakfast is so delicious fresh and hot. do not miss itFod by the pool is tasty fresh hot and the chips and salsa with quac is to die for. The best salsa I have ever had. My daughters hot dog was hebrew all beef and so fresh and the bun was crazy good. Now for the grand finale. YOU have to eat at the Watertable. Have to. The best food and the warm sea salt bread is the best bread I have ever tasted. The cracked pepper and sea salt fries with a secret sauce I will have dreams about until we return again next spring break. Ok ok I can go on and on. Please do not make a reservation anywhere else. Look at their website for specials. I got stay three nights get the fourth night free. Also do not be alarmed with the valet parking charge or the resort fee. You car is there before you even leave your room and the resort fee pays for the upkeep of all the amenities you get with this 10 star resort. Let me let you in on a secret. Your resort fee includes using the spa amenities including the most amazing steam room salt water jagcuzi and women a secret shower. The last shower on the left hand side. I relaxation room where those comfortable chairs you fall asleep on are outside. Not to mention the fruit water tea and healthly treats that await you. Lastly if the general manager of this resort is reading this review you have done an incredible job with hiring the most professional kind and warm employees. Well done. I would like to mention one employee that made our stay extra special and truly loved his job and took it very seriously. His name is AUSTIN and he was by the pool each day of our stay. His warm smile and his eagerness to make sure you had everyone you needed was the highlight of our stay. He remembered us by name and took time to get to know us and never left us without a fresh cold glass of water a warm greeting and even got us a ball to play catch together in the pool. I understand he is going to school for hotel management. He will be so successful and can see him running his own resort someday. It is employees like this that keep you coming back to this resort just so you can see someone like this that is so in love with job and takes it so seriously. Please pass this along to him and his manager Lucy. Great hire guys. do not let this one go. Promote him and have him train all of his peers. If all this being said words can not express how absolutely passionate I am that every family should experience a vacation at this resort and keep coming back to for more memories you will make together time and time again.

The HRHB was the perfect stay for our family. For context we stayed for a week in March 8 days and were there with 2 kids and grandparents. We did a small private wedding while there. The service is incredible. The adage that the people make the place is true here. Kyle at the concierge went above and beyond to help us. Alie at the front desk was helpful kind and enthusiastic about working with us. Austin helped us figure out the resort and sought us out. Miles in the Watertable a delight. There is something for everyone. The Bridge to the beach is perfect. it is pretty and convenient. I walked over that bridge to get married and it was just very special. My older daughter 12. and I walked ran every morning on the boardwalk and beach. We collected shells. My younger daughter and I stayed one afternoon on the beach. The hotel gives you chairs towels and sand toys. I road bikes with my family regular that we got on the resort and one on the boardwalk for a surrey bike. We roasted smores three times at night. We swam in the HEATED pools every day. We enjoyed food and cocktails by the pool as well. Perfect. The Water table did our wedding dinner. It was incredible. The food was amazing. The wine amazing. Service amazing. The thing was people seemed truly happy for us. It is real customer service. I had my hair and make up done at the SPA before the wedding by Jesica. It was a wonderful experience. The SPA itself is BEAUTIFUL do not miss it. I was very sad to leave. But we plan to return. Yes there are always things that are not perfect. someone kept ringing our doorbell to our SoCAL Suite. I had to housekeeping for more supplies almost every day when the spring break crowd came it was a little crowded and different vibe. Small things. Not a big deal. I do think some rooms may need updating. But our SoCAL suite was perfect. Nice view long patio. A door to our bedroom two bathrooms. Perfect for family with kids.

Only complaint would be the particular room we stayed in how it was advertises. We stayed in room 1353 Which may be incorrect. It was a Huntington Suite. Originally I booked a Full Ocean View room. the full ocean view was important to us. Through e mail I was marketing Upgrade Options to which I selected the Huntington Suite upgrade. Before selecting I tried to find out what type of OCEAN view the Huntington suites had because the full view was important. There was very little detail photos of the room itself and view. I thought that since our original preference was Full ocean view and the description on the website of the huntington suite was Views are Ocean and Pool grotto area. that surely it would have a Adequate nice view of the ocean. Unfortunately the view from our particular suite was nearly all grotto and BARELY a ocean sliver between a couple of trees. It was disappointing. The condition of the room could use some light upgrading but overall was clean and in good shape. Guest Service was fair. The bell hops the check in bell hops name was Ian were absolutely great. I will return to this hotel and now know to call for better detail on the room etc before booking in the future.", "offset": [937, 1034], "date": "2017-05-18", "cpt": "0", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 6, "uid": "84c1bb81-edd9-489c-a317-cfb8a6c85a3d", "sentence": "Dirty noisy and tired. We went to Hyat Huntington Beach for a convention. The hotel is in desperate need of a renovation. The first room we checked into smelled of cleaning fluid and had a nice view of a trailer park and oil refinery beyond. It was above the kidie pool so noise level was high. They showed us two more rooms before we found one we could tolerate. We went to the beach in the afternoon and had to pay for chairs and umbrella and had to carry and set them up too. The beach was wide crowded and hot. Not easy to set up umbrella ourselves. Food in restaurants was fine. Biggest relief was to discover a beautiful new mall about 14 mile to the north. Lots of nice restaurants that we could walk to. Wait until it is renovated to go to this property.", "offset": [74, 121], "date": "2017-07-14", "cpt": "0", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 7, "uid": "071afb62-b7ec-43b6-a021-9a6616afe575", "sentence": "Would not stay again. Not my cup of tea. Staying here for 8 nights still here and overall it seems to be a very family and dog friendly kind of place. Check in was easy and seamless but make sure you pull up the car to the bellman area and not where the convention space is we made that mistake and waited for a while before realizing why no one was coming out to help us. The agent that checked us in Amanda was friendly and upgraded us to an oversized room. The room is large but it does need a refresh. Not sure if it is the furniture that has a smell or the air freshener that they use smells but it is unpleasant and I keep the balcony door open to try to air it out. The balcony itself is a good size BUT it has these huge cracks on the cement pictured. Surprised that the state has not fined Hyat for not fixing this. I only go out to the balcony to put our wet bathing suits out to dry. I would not sit there. We also face the ocean which is nice but the noise from the road between the hotel and the beach is pretty loud. You would not want to sit out There anyway. There was another review on here that someone photographed all the dust and dirt in the room and around the property. I have to agree with that reviewer that the property is not as clean as it should be and this includes the pool the room and common areas. Definitely no where near a 4 star hotel property and not worth anywhere in the 40s nt. They are going to start renovating in Q4. So it probably tells you already what condition this property is in right now. While the beach itself is right across the way and chairs umbrellas and towels are provided it is a pain to lug all those things onto the beach and set it up. And when you are done you have to lug it all the way back. We have a toddler and found this to be very inconvenient. Although even if we did not I probably would not prefer this arrangement during a vacation. Our bed and pillows were comfy enough to get a good night sleep but boy are the walls between the rooms paper thin. They have a good neighbor policy that requests guests to keep tv and other noises down between the hours of 9 pm and 8 am because of guests complaining of the noise issues. You can hear people having conversations when they open dressers closets when they sneeze and cough etc. Thankfully our neighbors seem to be considerate and abide by the policy. But yikes it is bad and hopefully this is fixed during renovation. Valet parking is expensive at 37 nt. You can self park for less than half across the street. Food at the resort is OK. if you have s child and want Mac and cheese do not get it at Petes. I think they use the box stuff which is unacceptable in my book Can definitely find better eats down the way at Pacific City mall about a 10 min walkThe regency club was adequate and got us thru breakfast everyday with fruits yogurt cold cuts bagels and toast and one hot dish. They have an honor bar system for drinks 4 dollar beer and wine. Staff here are friendly and will assist you with anything you might need. Oh and the key card system needs to be replaced please. It takes us at least 3 tries most of the time to get the key to work in our room and the regency club. Overall I find this Hyat regency less than acceptable because of its condition. We met a few local families here and get the feeling that this is more of a staycation type of place to be close to the beach.", "offset": [1419, 1460], "date": "2017-07-19", "cpt": "0", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 8, "uid": "fcdc03fc-c8b2-47b4-9106-c91a3564e831", "sentence": "Gorgeous Location. Came upon this place very last minute while extending a trip out to Vegas from East Coast. We were very pleased in all. We traveled as a couple and this hotel was teeming with kids July 4th weekend but we did not mind. The architecture of the hotel is nice it is layout is fantastic especially if you do bring your kids as their is a town square feel to the are where the restaurants shops rental shop pizza shop etc are located. In addition there are tons of firepits all over where families were making Smores every night. You are basically right across Pacific Coast Highway from a beautiful broad deep beach which stretches for miles in each direction. The Hyat is the one hotel in Huntington that has its own pedestrian footbridge over the highway. For a nominal fee the hotel sets up chairs and an umbrella at the public beach for you. The water in the Pacific was surprisingly cold in JulyThe pool situation at the Hyat is pretty darn near ideal. There is a very very active kids pool where they have three pretty tame waterslides and bar grill. There is a separate grotto area where they have three hot tubs this is the secluded quiet relaxing spot but no bar grill here. Then their is the lovely main pool with a large hot tub off it and a bar grill with waiter service to your seats. One note of caution the hotel stresses that they are a no chair saving hotel. They are not kidding. We saw the overactive pool attendants move countless peoples stuff to the towel stand if they were gone from their seats for as little as 15 minutes. While the no saving policy is noble I think they need to relax the 15 back to about 45 minutes. The gym is very large and nicely equipped. The Watertable main restaurant is very high quality and runs a great reverse happy hour from 9 11 highly recommended small plates at 50 with drink specials to boot. The rooms are decently sized and all have a patio or balcony but are a little past their prime in terms of finishes and decor. The hotel is addressing that though and plans to renovate all rooms this Winter. Huntington itself is great. The huge running biking path between the beach and PCH stretches for miles in each direction paradise for runners. I would stay here again just for that reason. There is a cool brand new shopping center an easy walk past two other hotels that has great restaurants BlueGold and LSXO are two we triedIf the rooms were recently updated I would give this five stars. I hope to return someday.

We just arrived at the Hyat in Huntington Beach. So excited well we were until we got here. Entry looks grand but takes a downturn when you walk in the musty lobby. Our check in was supposed to be at four and we were really early so we decided to hang out for several hours. Every place at the hotel is simply just very old and tired. No fresh vibe whatsoever. When we got to our room it was like a flashback to the late 1990s. Tired old furniture worn and matted carpet. Bad artwork worn furniture. So disappointing. There are hundreds of people at the pool with nowhere to sit and it simply just feels like a public place. nothing special or crisp at all about it. I am truly trying to find some hope for this place but it needs a complete renovation and they need to rethink the pool area. It is like a public pool.

I was disappointed with my experience at the Hyat Regency Huntington Beach due to the consistent hype it gets. First let us talk about the good. The food and drinks are EXCELLENT. Tanner and Jacklyn at the hotels upscale bar made my stay with their genuine smiles and their authentic hospitality. Chance the bellmen is also a sharp young man who was eager to please and he went out of his way to make sure I had everything that I needed. The spa facility is also pretty awesome and my massage with Beverly was great. The property is well maintained since the housekeeping and groundskeping staff are second to none quality. HOWEVER it is very dated. For example my bath tub looked like it was falling apart and wiggled around easily which should not happen. I am pleased to hear that the property is going under a full renovation very soon as they need it. The part that upset me the most about my stay was my interactions with the front desk staff. Only two of the staff looked happy to be there and I felt like I was bothering them when I requested assistance and that they had better things to do. One of the front office hosts which I will not post the name on a public forum transferred me to housekeeping when I requested turndown service one evening. As a front desk agent myself that is a simple request the host could have put in the system without transferring me to housekeeping. The same host sounded frustrated when I asked what the hours for breakfast were as well. I would have loved to see more empathy and energy from the front office team overall. The host who checked me out was not overly friendly either and did not go out of their way to put a smile on my face. Not what Hyat is about.

Overall not a bad stay and valet staff in particularly very friendly and on top of things. Here \u2019s a few problems1. Main Pool and Spa out of Service. If I had known about this issue prior to booking and arriving I would have picked a different hotel there are two comparables ones right next door and a third comparable that does not have a pool but suddenly looking very appealing. The hotel was about 95 empty no one offered to upgrade a room or anything to compensate for this serious disappointment. In fact there was a 25 per day resort fee that the hotel only offered to remove when I complained about this upon departure. why was this on the bill in the first place given unavailable pool and spa status to be fair there is a kidie style second rate pool in the back that was open2. Maid service. The bathtub was not draining properly and had to get this fixed a good housekeeping service would keep track of these types of problems assuming they are cleaning the bathtub daily. After first night the garbage was not taken out of the room and the ice bucket was still full of icy water and no replacement plastic liner3. Rooms are okay but need renovation. Water pressure for shower is good but barely drip drip for the regular bathroom sink4. Bed is comfortable4. Very quiet even though some work was being done upstairs for at least part of our stay. On plus side1. Staff is very pleasant and helpful2. Access to beach is good even though compound is extensive. Having a land bridge to access the beach is good. Beach chairs need to be replaced. but the newer updated Tomy Bahama ones which are better and lighter and have the rails facing away from you so when trekking with them back from the beach the sand is n\u2019t directly touching your lower back rear3. No pool and spa no upgrade offer despite something like 5 occupancy rate this past week and having to for removing resort fee is unacceptable for a high end hotel that is trying to present itself as first rate hospitality. Not real \u201c fresh squeezed \u201d orange juice for a meal that taps out to 35 p for breakfast at their mainstay restaurant is also not acceptable and you feel a bit scamed.
