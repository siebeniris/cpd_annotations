Where to begin. First we booked this hotel because originally they said construction would be finished by mid May. Then they changed to the beginning of June. now it is the end of June. They really should close during the construction because things are just terrible. First they moved the front desk down to the first floor. When we checked in the front desk people did not seem very helpful. They gave us 2 Honors bags even though we had 3 rooms. Then you have to take 1 elevator up to the actual lobby of the hotel. It looked like a war zone. Breakfast was moved to one of the ballrooms more on that in a moment. Our rooms were facing downtown Cincinnati. The views were great and the suite was a nice size. We needed to print our boarding passes for our flight the next morning. I went down stairs to the front desk and asked where the business center was. They said they did not have one because of the construction. Later My Dad asked again when we got back from dinner. One clerk said yes just follow the signs and the other said no they did not have one. You work the front desk how do you not know whether or not you have a business center. Turns out they did have one. It was in the breakfast area. After we got back from dinner my sister texted me and said they had lost power to half their room including the bathroom. My 86 year old grandmother was in the bathroom at the time the power went out but thankfully she was alright. My sister called the front desk to ask when the power would be restored and they said they did not know. They claimed it went off because of the weather. Really. It was a clear day with no wind. The power finally was restored and they did not have anymore problems. Breakfast was mess because it was in the ballroom. They did not have some of the items other Embassys had on our stay. It seemed like they were trying not to do as much since it was in a makeshift room.

We have been hassling with Embassy Suites and corporate since May 22 2018 when I had a medical emergency and went to the ER in serious condition and was admitted to the hospital for five days for two surgeries. My husband had just left the day before on a 550 mile trip from California to Ohio and up into Canada that would take 18 days and which required 13 different hotel reservations. Naturally when he received my phone call about my ER and hospital admittance he had to turn around and come home returning his rental car and cancelling all of his reservations. Cancellations with 12 hotels other than this one went smoothly. His reservations for Embassy Suites in Covington KY were 3 \u00bd days out from his call to them on 52 requesting cancellation for 525 526. He was informed that his reservation was non cancelable because he had selected a pre paid rate. He had never intended to select a pre paid rate as the cost savings differential is always insignificant compared to the risk and who does n\u2019t have situations arise where cancellation is necessary. He explained to the manager that he did not intend to select that rate and had thought he clicked the button for the AAA rate he had just signed up for the Hilton Honors program specifically for this trip and was using their website for the first time so was not familiar with it. He also said if they were to look at all of his other reservations at Hilton brand hotels over the next two weeks they could see he did not select a pre paid rate for any of those reservations lending credence to his assertion that it was an innocent mistake. The manager just kept reciting the policy. She did agree to only charge him for one night instead of the two reserved. My husband indicated that was a start but he was still unhappy to be charged for the remaining night because there were several conventions going on and he knew for a fact that people attending his convention were having to book hotels over 100 miles from the event and therefore Embassy Suites would have no difficulty reboking his room especially since he was notifying them THREE A HALF DAYS IN ADVANCE. The manager just stuck to her recitation of the policy. At this point he figured he would deal with it after he got home and got me out of the hospital. Obviously the hotel made no effort to work with him to rebok the room or even honor their initial agreement to charge him for only one night since the day after he was slated to stay they sent him an invoice for the entire amount and thanking him for his stay. A stay that never occurred and never could have occurred as he was almost 20 miles away in the operating waiting room. He called the hotel again and asked to speak to another manager who said \u201c Our records indicate you checked into your room \u201d. That \u2019s crazy. This leads us to believe that someone stayed in the room that the hotel charged us for \u2013 either the staff had friends or family stay in it on our dime or the hotel did in fact rebok the room and made double the profit by charging two parties for the same room. At this point my husband took his dissatisfaction to corporate. Corporate seemed understanding especially since his cancellation was due to a medical emergency but in the end they just turned it all back to the hotel that we already were getting nowhere with. In fact the hotel reported back to corporate that they had contacted us post complaint to corporate and resolved the issue. They NEVER contacted us and another Trip Advisor Reviewer had that same experience as detailed in their review. So my husband contacted corporate again and they just sent an e mail saying that he had received a confirmation that indicated he had a pre paid rate so they felt refunding one night was already magnanimous on their part even though he is a first time customer new to the Hilton Honors program and using their reservations site for the first time. At this point after numerous attempts at several levels over two months it is clear that Embassy Suites in Covington KY and Hilton Brand corporate are more interested in sticking to their policy than encouraging future business and retaining customers. It was rather ironic that in the final e mail to us they thanked us for our loyalty and looked forward to our future business. THERE WILL BE NO FUTURE BUSINESS FROM US AT EMBASSY SUITES ANYWHERE FROM HERE ON OUT. We will also elect to stay in other brands of hotels like Best Western who have never given us a problem in decades of staying with them rather than any Hilton brand hotel. I just have no stomach for high dollar businesses that are so inflexible as to have to stick to policy rather than work with customers in extenuating circumstances and I do n\u2019t think ANY of us out there want to deal with businesses that value the to the extent that they would rather be right than be kind. I looked at Trip Advisor before I decided to post this to see if our experience would be an outlier and apparently it is not. Out of the 39 reviews I looked at from 729 back to mid May 16 were ratings of \u201c Terrible \u201d or \u201c Poor \u201d. When you include the 9 \u201c Average \u201d reviews and most people tend to rate hotels above average or excellent 25 out of 39 reviews are Average or worse. That is 64. That is a horrendous track record. And look at the titles \u201c Stay Elsewhere \u201d \u201c Never Again \u201d \u201c Embassy Suites Nightmare \u201d \u201c What Could Go Wrong Did Go Wrong \u201d. At least those people received a room for their money.

We were supposed to check in at 40pm. We could not check in until 60pm. I am pretty sure numerous people had the same issue as there were a bunch of people waiting in the lobby for hours. We had plans and were starting to panic. They were supposed to text me when the room was ready. We were getting close to our time for our planned event with the kids so I texted the number that was supposed to text me. They texted back and said the check in time was not guaranteed. So i pay a decent amount that does not guarantee me that I can check in on a decent time. 40pm is a late time for check in compared to most hotels already. They would not be happy if I stayed in the hotel 2 hours after checkout. In fact I am sure i would get charged. Also while i waiting there were a bunch of gnats flying around my area. I do not remember seeing gnats this early in the spring time. that is not a good sign. The front desk did give us a key to let the kids in the pool while we were waiting for our room to finally be ready. I did appreciate that. The only problem was that the pool did not have any towels. I went to the front desk to ask and a woman named Sarah said she had already been notified and she was taking care of it. It was not. We had to take clothes from our kids bag to dry off with. We finally got a room. It was clean and just like all the past rooms I have had at this hotel. We usually enjoy the breakfast in the morning. We did not this time. the bacon and sausage were awful.
