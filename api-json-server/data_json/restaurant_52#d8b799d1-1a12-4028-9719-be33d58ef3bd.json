My husband and I stayed at Hotel Rouge in Washington DC for 2 nights while visiting the city. The location is near Dupont Circle as well as close to the monuments. The hotel is a bit hard to find our GPS guided us to the wrong place so maybe use the hotels directions instead. If you drive a red car you get one night of free parking. Check in was a breeze and they upgraded our room for free. We had over 450 square feet of space in Washington DC. that is usually unheard of. The bed was extremely comfortable and we had plenty of room to spread out. There was a cute little alcove that had a comfy sofa on one end of the room and the other end of the room was covered in windows and there were two chairs that we found to be very comfortable. Our view was of the Australian embassy and the Christmas lights up and down the street were beautiful. If you are a Kimpton Karma Rewards member you automatically get 10 off the in room bar or the bar downstairs Bar Rouge you also get free WiFi. The drinks in the bar are creative and interesting. One night we pigged out on hot wings and fries with truffle oil. Yum. Every night at the hotel between 5 and 6 pm there is a wine hour with complimentary wine and nibbles. A great way to start off the evening before going out to dinner. The neighborhood was very safe and valet parking was easy just give them some time to get your car for you so call the front desk ahead of time before checking out. The great thing about this hotel is that they honor requests. We asked for a very quiet room and we got it. Sleep quality was great and the staff was incredibly professional and welcoming thanks Kiah. We had a great time and have a new favorite hotel in Washington DC. We will return.", "offset": [1257, 1321], "date": "2015-12-27", "cpt": "0", "category": "restaurant"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "54f8a7d7-a40a-4dc1-ad8e-33bade95ddfc", "sentence": "there is a red for everyone.

Our room was wonderfully large well designed and comfortable. The furnishings were all in great condition and the staff attentive.

The hotel did try to charge us 20 day for coffee and internet without even verifying that we used either so be aware at check out. Politely ask them to remove the charge and they should.

We arrived on Tuesday afternoon to a more then welcoming staff and wine hour 5 6 and well needed. The staff on the checkout Mariene sorry if i spelt it wrong and the other lady on reception at the time sorry did not get your name were very welcoming and attentive and swiftly had us checked in and up to our room 907. Once checked in went for a walk and some food and arrived to a gift a really great start to our honeymoon. The room was spacious and welcoming lit mainly by lamps the king bed was firm and comfortable and accommodated us well especially as I am 63 and my feet were not out of the end. Our room was cleaned each day and always felt fresh when you walked in. Our stay there was great friendly staff everywhere always willing to help. Ask for the metro card great for Arlington cemetery the pentagon tour and then the north of the Jefferson memorial all on the blue line if you plan on using it as they may have credit on or not but means you do not have to pay for the card and then just return them when you are done. A really nice touch. It is close to a bike share left out of the hotel and around the corner from the Australian embassy. Using the big bus tour map available at reception we planned out all out where the bike stops were as you have 30 mins free then the charges kick in. 8 for 24 hour access and if planned properly that is the only cost. Throughout our stay we felt very welcome and loved every minute in the hotel. Nothing was too much getting us a kettle to have tea a sowing kit or anything else including take out menus. If you are sight seeing it is a great place to stay as it is a straight walk down to the White House and the national monument from there you can see the Lincoln memorial and the capital building. It is all walkable but we suggest maybe using the bikes as well just to save your fetThere is restaurants bars and shops all within walking distance either on 17th or going he other way to 15th and 14th so the location is great. With Farragut north and west metros no more then a 10 minute walk away. A truly great start to our honeymoon in a fantastic hotel and amazing city. We will be back one day as we still need to go to the White House.

When I got back to my room this afternoon it was making the noise. I called again and asked for help and the guy came and said I needed to keep the fan on medium or high \u2014 that it only made the noise when the fan was on low. That worked about 2 hours but horrible noise has started up again. Also I had to call for help to get the TV to work due to some jicky issue with the remote.
