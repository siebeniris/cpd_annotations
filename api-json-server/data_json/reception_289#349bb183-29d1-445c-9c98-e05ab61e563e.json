We decided to take a cruise on a very special ship QM 2 in order to celebrate an important birthday. We chose a short one in order to have a taster and see if we enjoyed it. To start with the check in at Southampton was good with very pleasant helpful people. Once we got on the boat it was chaos. There were so many people arriving at the same time and the staff were totally overwhelmed. We ended up wondering around the ship looking for our cabin. We were constantly mistaken for Germans which the staff seemed to find most amusing. This was not surprising as apparently there were 20 of then on board and 92 British although we only met 3. These numbers are not verified probably exaggerated and there is a lot of gossip on board ship about things like this. As this was the end of a longer cruise and Hamburg was our destination I appreciate that this is inevitable. Our cabin was lovely we had upgraded fortunately and the balcony was super with comfortable sunbeds. Thank goodness the weather was good so we were able to use them. There was a welcome bottle of champagne which was a nice touch. We then went in search of lunch and ended up in Kings Court Britania as part of a huge scrum of people filling their faces with food as if they had never eaten before. The Kings Grill had finished serving. We tried to use Kings Grill but on two occasions it had finished serving 830 for breakfast which seems a little early for holidays. Breakfast in Kings Court was terrible. We finally managed o get a table shared with two very unhappy English people. The buffet was nothing special and the coffee tea facilities truly awful. Very dull coffee and one of the machines was broken so a huge queue formed. I asked for hot milk and it eventually came in a cup which proved difficult to pour from. At lunchtime we decided to try Kings Grill but it was closed for some reason. Fortunately in the evening we had two dinners there and it was very good ditto breakfast the next day. Thank goodness for the upgrade. At one point we were desperate for a decent coffee and found one in the Kings Grill lounge. We had a drink there in the evening and noticed later that both items had a 15 service charge added on automatically. Our final bill seemed exorbitant for just two drinks and two coffees. We gathered that noro virus had been on the previous cruise and reports varied from 3 300 sufferers. The staff sprayed our hands rather haphazardly as we went in to eat. The Cunard PR team must be good as we would not have wanted to go if there were 300 people with it the previous week. The boat was tired as it was the last cruise before a re fit. This was not a good enough excuse for those of us who had paid to be on this particular departure. The entertainment programme was awful. The acts and band was totally unknown and obscure frankly boring. We were better off in our room enjoying the view. The Spa was nice although the staff were unsettled due to the fact that they were not sure what they were going to do for the next 3 12 weeks during the re fit. This adds an air of uncertainty. The shops were good but on the whole very pricey. They need a bog standard chemist for paracetamol plaster sun tan cream etc. If there is one there it is not immediately obvious. We thoroughly enjoyed out visit to the Bridge. Arrangements for departure were awful due to overcrowding. We had to line up to speak to one of 3 may have been 4 pursers who informed us that we had to have our luggage packed and outside our room by 9 pm. This is utterly ridiculous when you are on a short cruise and expected to dress decently in the evening. Fortunately the evening was an informal one. We elected to carry our own bags but still had to gather at a certain point different colours for different areas in order to disembark. I am sure this works in theory but in practise people totally disregarded this and chaos reigned. We ended up on the Quay for over an hour waiting for the buses. What seemed like thousands of builders presumably all due to work on the ship during the upgrade were streaming onto the boat as thousands of other members of staff were leaving. Having been through customs I decided to go outside the terminal to take some photos. I was allowed out and then virtually arrested as I tried to re enter to sit quite innocently with my husband. The officials attitude was horrible. Not Cunards fault. My own organisation was poor. I should have booked our own flights and chosen a later flight. Perhaps the travel agent could have mentioned this point to allow us even a few hours in Hamburg. Cunard need to communicate more with their passengers. It takes a while to get to know the way around the ship and we ended up asking waiters and porters for directions and would have appreciated a clearly written information sheet with a decent map of the ship and clear instructions as to the opening hours of all the restaurants. Heaven help passengers sharing a boat with 60 other people. In conclusion whatever the excuses re the refurbishment this was not an experience we will ever repeat even if it was to a more exotic location.", "offset": [2928, 3088], "date": "2016-06-03", "cpt": "1", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 14, "uid": "cfcc6ed8-83f2-4297-9160-fc603cccba1d", "sentence": "One Night Only.

One thing to watch is learn where the operating elevators are they have kept all of the non operational ones and sign posted them but can be confusing if you do not figure out the layout of your deck.

Especially at night. There are several restaurants and gift stores aboard as well as ice and vending. But note there is a stiff cost for parking and there has not been anything like shops alongside the docking area for 25 years or so. The closest shopping then is downtown. there is actually free bus service to the ship from downtown Long Beach.

We stayed at the Queen Mary for 2 nights. It was unique experience like taking a step back in time. Surrounded by the deep history of this ship unlike any other hotel that we might have stayed at. The staff was incredible and a big shout out to Benjamin our waiter at Sir Winston \u2019s. A restaurant on the QM That we would highly recommend.", "offset": [220, 306], "date": "2020-01-24", "cpt": "2", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 29, "uid": "87073d46-1a27-46ad-8e99-54d46c03afc8", "sentence": "Beautiful treasure. We loved our stay on the Queen it \u2019s like staying in a floating museum. So many details are preserved and the paranormal tour was very informative though somewhat limited we would have liked to go into the swimming pool area for instance. Sir Winston \u2019s food and service were excellent as was the Observatory bar. Though we were told that the rooms were filled to capacity the Promenade restaurant was not open. Our room was smaller than last time with a narrow hallway to the porthole. All staff were helpful and very friendly.", "offset": [507, 548], "date": "2020-03-03", "cpt": "2", "category": "reception"}]}
