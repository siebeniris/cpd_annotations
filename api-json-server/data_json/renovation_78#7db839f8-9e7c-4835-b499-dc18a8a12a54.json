The friendliness of everyone we met the accommodations beach lagoon view suite and the food were all terrific. It was the first time that we felt the butler concept worked for us. In part because we felt taken care not just in our room but by the fact that the butlers would find us throughout the resort and confirm appointments and check in throughout the day. It really felt more like a concierge service than just a butler service. Also the butler service was easy going and not overly formal or excessively intrusive. Thanks to Johana and DJ. I hesitate to make any suggestions because I am fighting the instinct to keep RM from being too well known. However here goes. I think RM could benefit from a bit of a promotional visual overhaul. A frequent comment of ours and others was that the website just did not do the property justice. For example the various rooms are not well profiled. Good to have florplans but more pictures are needed. Also the grounds at both day and night are really more beautiful and perfectly tailored than the website shows. Also I understand now why the resort is built the way that it is in part due the geographical limitations. I wish I had been told why the RM has two parts in land and the beach based on the limestone and structure of the land. People want to know about nature and land preservation and it should be a selling point. Our trip was a part of a long story related to the failure of Baha Mar and the experience of Rosewood Mayakoba have made us true believers again in the Rosewood brand. We will return and now we have to convince you guys to start a return guest discountIt was a great stay. Thank you so very much.

The only issue I had with our experience at the hotel was the big groups that were obviously given discounts to help fill rooms in the low seasons. I understand it is important for business but there is a price. For example the Forescout group was not the caliber of guest that you would normally attract. Their behavior level of drunkenness and disregard would give me pause about booking Rosewood Mayakoba again. I certainly would not do so without asking about any groups that would be in house while we are there. The AXA group was an example of a group who knows their manners and respects the other guests.

We just returned from our 6th stay since 2015. The resort keeps getting better with each trip. The most noticeable improvement this trip was the massive beach expansion. This the product of an ongoing enviro friendly beach rejuvenation project that has been in the works for several years and was rolled out in June. The new beach is huge and has been completely transformed. For those who have previously visited and encountered a small beach or those who heard that the beach was n\u2019t that great everything has changed. The brilliant white sand is soft and comfortable. There are virtually no rocks in the water so that you can walk right in comfortably. It \u2019s unbelievable. Notwithstanding the amazing beach the standout at this resort is the outstanding service at all levels. This resort operates as a well oiled machine. Staff in every department is warm genuine professional and attentive. You will want for nothing. Staff anticipates things before you think you even need them. Service at the beach pools and in all restaurants is outstanding. There is very little turnover among the staff. We have seen the same faces each trip for the past 3 years which is testament to how much these associates love working at the resort and its outstanding management team led by Daniel Scott and Lutz Arnold. The rooms are just incredible. We \u2019ve stayed in several different room categories over the years and each is magnificent in its own way. You can not go wrong no matter what room category you choose. We like to stay off the beach on the lagoons so we can watch all the wildlife around the lagoons and rivers that meander throughout. The wildlife includes birds turtles fish and sometimes crocodiles and monkeys. If you prefer a beachfront room you wo n\u2019t be disappointed particularly with the incredible beach renovation project now complete. The property is big but each suite is equipped with well maintained bicycles which are easy and comfortable to ride to get around in short order. The bellmen will also transport you around in golf carts. Golf cart transportation is ultra efficient. A call to front desk or a text on the Rosewood ap usually results in a golf cart appearing at your doorstep in 60 seconds or less. Incredibly the Associates seem to know every guests \u2019 name and usually address each guest by name. The experience is so personal. I \u2019m told there are 570 associates at Rosewood Mayakoba and as a result the staff to guest ratio is like 3 or 4 to 1 or something like that. It shows too because the service is phenomenal. You \u2019l be blown away by it. We love the food at this resort. The executive chef Juan Pablo and his team do a marvelous job. In past trips we had gone off property and dined at some of the other restaurants at the other hotels that are part of the Mayakoba complex but we stopped doing that because the dining experiences at Rosewood are so exceptional and superior as compared to other places. One night they had a wonderful beach barbeque under the stars and it was incredible. Great entertainment wonderful food and amazing atmosphere. Another night we dined at Le Ceiba which is an incredibly intimate farm to table experience with dishes heavily influenced by ancient Mayan traditions. The setting and flavors at Le Ceiba were amazing. No review would be complete without mentioning the spa. It is the finest spa we have ever seen. A trip to the spa is transformative. The amenities the attendants the therapists and the setting are spectacular. My group went to the spa almost every day because it was so addicting. The grounds are immaculately maintained. There are beautiful flowers and bushes everywhere. Just walking the grounds and enjoying the scenery is an activity unto itself. The management team is largely responsible for the magic of Rosewood Mayakoba. Executive Director Daniel Scott Resort Manager Lutz Arnold Director of Rooms Monica Ortiz and Guest Experience Manager. Jose Maria Lizaraga all deserve special mention because they are true professionals. It is obvious that the associates \u2019 enthusiasm is a reflection of the outstanding management and leadership skills that these management professionals exhibit. The management presence is unbelievable. They are seemingly everywhere all the time making sure that every guest is truly satisfied and pampered. Like I said the personalization is incredible. The resort was 95 full while we were there but the staff make it seem like you are their only focus. Plus there is so much room it never feels crowded \u2013 no saving chairs or clamoring for reservations. Butler service is outstanding. We had two wonderful butlers Edgardo and Karen who were there for everything we needed. They unpacked our suitcases and when we returned to the room on our first day it looked like a showroom in a fancy department store all color coordinated and organized beautifully. They checked on us from time to time and took care of anything we needed. The butlers here are superbly trained and qualified. In summary this is easily the finest resort on the Mayan Riviera and in all of Mexico. It is so easy to get to from the US. As soon as you arrive on the property the pampering begins and never stops. If you \u2019re looking for a short or long getaway in which you can completely turn off and recharge this is the place. There \u2019s have a huge percentage of repeat guests here and you \u2019l quickly understand why.

Five years after our first visit to the Rosewood Mayakoba on the Riviera Maya 30 minutes south and a world of difference from the high rise hotel strip of Cancun my wife and I returned last week to this truly remarkable resort. I \u2019m inspired to write again about our experience in detail because many people found my previous Trip Advisor review January 27 2014 to be helpful and since then there have been changes all improvements. at the resort. I hope this review will give those who are trying to decide among destinations and properties a sense of what to expect. My wife and I have been to some great resorts and hotels around the world but our experience at Rosewood Mayacoba this past week stands out among the very best. For your reference we \u2019re 55 in age excessively educated dual professionals wine collectors consumers and foodies if any of that helps to place this review in context. The hospitality facilities and service are phenomenal. But the experience again began with the reception at the Cancun Airport. After the hectic and very slow customs and immigration at the airport we emerged to find two members of the Rosewood Mayakoba RM staff welcoming us by name. They took our luggage confirmed the ingredients in the drinks that would welcome us at the resort and took us to our transport \u2013 an immaculate beige Cadilac SUV. We settled into the back seat relaxing in the cool of the air conditioning and our driver offered us refreshing chilled towels and bottled water. We were out of the Cancun Airport in minutes avoided the hotel strip in Cancun and turned south towards Playa del Carmen for the 40minute ride to the RMThe quality of service continued \u2013 and was enhanced \u2013 with reception at the resort. As our car pulled up to the entrance we were again greeted by name our luggage whisked away and we were escorted to the reception area in the lobby which is beautiful and understated two frozen drinks awaited us \u2013. I do n\u2019t remember the ingredients but they were delicious and a taste of things to come. Registration was quick and the director of guest services came up again greeting us by name \u2013 but by now we were becoming accustomed to that told us about the resort and solicited our questions. We had few since this was our second visit to this paradise. We were escorted us down to the dock where we were taken in one of the RM \u2019s private launches to our accommodations. Perhaps it \u2019s unnecessary to say at this point that the launch was beautiful and in perfect condition with its mahogany woodwork and as we sat down we were offered cool towels and a plate of chilled fruit for the relatively brief ride to our accommodations. Our accommodation a Deluxe Overwater Lagoon Suite was again in a very private area of the resort where we looked out only on nature no buildings or structures were in sight. We had requested this in advance. Take a look at the resort property map. We were in 417 five years ago and I was relieved and delighted on this trip to learn that our request for the same accommodations we had enjoyed the first time had been met \u2013. Deluxe Overwater Lagoon Suite 417 which features a perfect fully natural view in all directions no structures or development of any kind can be seen \u2013 just the lagoon the mangrove forest birds fish etcWhen we pulled up to the private dock of our Suite we could see our butler Alberto waiting for us. He \u2019s a young man dressed in Bermuda shorts and straw hat. He made it clear that ANYTHING we wanted to make our stay more enjoyable he wanted to do. We subsequently took him up on this as well as with our other butler when Alberto was enjoying his day off. We were never disappointed. Alberto took us inside the suite and showed us around. This suite had been beautifully remodeled just a few months ago and it felt perfectly new and they had decorated beautifully the dining room table and chandelier for my wife \u2019s birthday \u2013 a wonderful welcome indeed. Then Alberto prepared a couple of really superb Mezcalita de Pina for us using the complimentary bottle of excellent Mezcal that comes with the suite along with fresh fruit drinking water ice coffee etc. replenished dailyThe suite is so large and with so many features that this orientation took nearly 30 minutes the living room and dining area face the lagoon with nothing that is not natural in the view chaise lounge for two outside plus a couch and coffee table and the large and wonderfully warm plunge pool are all on our deck just above our dock. The living room is very large with couches dining table desk great fast wifi flat screen tv one here and one in the bedroom but we never turned either on and a bar with coffee service. That leads to the front hallway the ground entrance to the Suite and beyond that is the bedroom with king size bed the other large flat screen tv and more windows onto the natural surroundings including the tropical fish we could see swimming in the water under us with a huge walk in closet with separate areas of shelves and hanging space for two. Next there \u2019s a dressing room with table chair and large make up mirror. I used this for my laptop since there is no longer a desk in the living room which turned out not to be a problem. By the way the Wifi is fast and perfectly reliableAnd the bathroom \u2013 a suite itself and the size of some New York City apartments with separated double sinks separate WC room very deep soaking tub separate large indoor rain shower and then outside another very natural shower in a lovely setting surrounded by beautiful flora. In the suite \u2019s living room one feels outdoors because the glass walls of the living room slide back to make it completely one with the outdoor deck and plunge pool and so the tropical scents and sounds become part of the accommodations. We made good use every day of the plunge pool the indoor soaking tub and the indoor and outdoor showers. In the evening with the turndown service the staff always lights the dozen candles on the deck and around the plunge pool. Moving around the common areas of the resort is a treat. The staff \u2013 who greatly outnumber the guest population even when the resort is at full capacity \u2013 always say hello typically by name. The lobby area includes the reception area indoor outdoor like everything else a bar and cigar bar and Casa del Lago the most formal of the three restaurants more about this below. Here there are two infinity pools waterfalls and gorgeous flora. A short distance away is the spa \u201c Sense \u201d which is unbelievably beautiful \u2013 inside and out and also remodeled recently. It is truly beautiful beyond description with waterfalls paths through the woods to hidden lagoons for swimming and quiet areas just for contemplating the serene environment. All of the sitting areas are lovely let alone the usual array of facilities and treatment areas. My wife made regular use of the Spa classes each morning. These sessions of various kinds turned out to be essentially private since she was the only customerThere \u2019s also a beautiful new area where the RM grows much of the fruit vegetables and herbs used by the kitchen. Another excellent recent improvement is \u201c Aqui me quedo \u201d a beautiful new are on the beach that is reserved for adults only and includes an indoor outdoor living room with a library three warm swimming pools a restaurant bar and abundant beach area. There are perhaps five to ten times as many lounge chairs on the beach as are ever needed. And while we relaxed in the perfect temperature exceptionally low humidity and pleasant sea breeze on the beach the staff regularly brought \u201c amenities \u201d \u2013 snacks and drinks cleaning for eye glasses iPads and iPhones and \u2013 my wife \u2019s favorite \u2013 Tatinger Saturday featuring complimentary Champagne on the beachThe flora and fauna of the resort are one of its most special features. RM correctly bills itself as a \u201c luxury ecotourism destination \u201d. That refers to the fact that the setting has been kept natural in most areas such as the lagoons and to the fact that there is a remarkable amount of wildlife everywhere. Waterfowl ranging from Great Blue Heron to small ducks are in abundance and constantly flying by our deck. Likewise there are a variety of very colorful land birds around the property. There are iguanas \u2013 some very large a few feet long \u2013 and a range of smaller lizards some less than a half inch long. And just off our deck we can sometimes see fish swimming in the lagoon not to mention a constant abundance of turtles and waterfowl. Most of all superlatives must come into play when describing the service at Rosewood Mayakoba. What can I say. It rivals the service at Twin Farms in Vermont and Jumby Bay in Antigua and that really says something. Everyone greets us by name and those staff members \u2013 such as the ubiquitous gardeners working on the lush perfectly maintained grounds who do n\u2019t know our names when we \u2019re walking on paths or riding on the bikes they provide from our suite to the lobby or the beach nevertheless make sure to greet us. What is striking is that everyone on the staff clearly wants to make one feel personally welcome here. They want to know what more they can do. We asked for several things and they soon appeared. One might anticipate that the cuisine at the restaurants inside a destination resort would be second rate but even for confirmed foodies the cuisine is a pleasant surprise. Casa del Lago the most formal restaurant is Italian and unlike so many restaurants in resorts around the world it is a serious establishment with excellent cuisine and excellent wines although the markup over US retail prices averages at least 400 and sometimes as great as 70 instead of the typical 100 wine price markup in restaurants in the USA. I requested that a copy of the long wine list be sent to me before we departed the USA and I as able to identify three excellent bottles that were also low outliers in terms of the price markup. I also considered bringing some bottles from our cellar at home and paying the 60 corkage fee but decided not to mainly because we did not want to have to check baggage on our flights. One final comment about wine. We enjoy red wines at cellar temperature say 57 58 F and I \u2019m pleased to say that the RM staff were delighted each night to chill our selections to that temperature. Because we arranged for the meal plan which includes breakfast and dinner the meals seemed reasonably priced. We had requested terrace outdoor seating at dinner on the guest preference form months before and we were never disappointed. We also ate dinner at Agave Azul which features a tequila library and sushi bar plus wok and grill dishes. Given the pricing of the meal plan this is a great deal for dinner because on the meal plan you order whatever you want as many courses as you want. Punta Bonita is the beachside restaurant featuring regional Mexican cuisine but on this visit we did not eat there. On Friday night there was a very enjoyable cocktail party before dinner outdoors of course and with a live band great drinks appetizers and \u2013 most important \u2013 the exceptionally friendly staff. My one complaint is that the recorded music during dinner at Casa del Lago and even more so at Agave Azul was inappropriate and too loud for the setting popular rock music whereas subtle Spanish guitar or classical music would be more in keeping with the setting and the environment. On our first visit which was 7 nights we left the property on one day for an excursion arranged by the RM with a luxury private tour company to the ruins of Tulum plus snorkeling in a lagoon north of Tulum. It was pricey but excellent. But this time on our 4night visit never left the resort. Not to be missed are the free excursions within the Mayakoba property including a boat ride on the launch that travels among the three resorts of Mayakoba \u2013 the Rosewood Mayakoba the Banyan Tree Resort the Fairmont and a new resort Andaz Mayakoba a Hyat property. The RM is clearly the best of the best. The ranking seems to be Rosewood Banyan Tree Fairmont and Andaz. We went on the eco tour cruise one morning but the RM \u2019s resident nature guide biologist was not on board so it was not as interesting as the one we took on our previous trip. All of these Mayakoba boats are electric and so there are no sounds to disturb the mood no smell of exhaust and no oil polluting the water. At the end of our four night stay our return trip to the airport from the RM in one of their beige Cadilac SUVs was sad but pleasant. Our driver offered chilled water and beer. We accepted the former. And then at the Cancun Airport we were greeted by another RM staff member who took us and our luggage as far as he could \u2013 to the security line \u2013. and then we re entered the real worldMy bottom line is that five years after our first visit to the Rosewood Mayakoba which we had loved we were not in the least bit disappointed and indeed some aspects seemed even better. I \u2019m delighted to say that I can continue to recommend the Rosewood Mayakoba on the Riviera Maya. Even for these two jaded travelers it provided a wonderful albeit brief mid winter vacation.", "offset": [6499, 6619], "date": "2019-01-21 00:00:00", "cpt": "1", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 14, "uid": "699959a5-a0aa-4ad7-b4e0-5c2556784717", "sentence": "Jose Maria Lizaraga Chicuate was so amazing to us during our stay.

It explains why we continue to return. We visited last Thanksgiving and decided to make a Spring time trip as well. We were not disappointed. Our room was once again ready when we arrived at 930am. A feat unto itself if you travel much. The minute we arrived on property we were greeted at the car door by the Guest Relations Manager Jose Maria. He is AMAZING. This was not the first time we have had the pleasure of his assistance. As soon as I stepped out he was there with a hug and a loud Mrs xxx I did not expect to see you again so soon. Welcome home. I could live here truly. We had requested our favorite villa style which is surprisingly the lower costing non over water villa. But we were happily upgraded as returning guests to one of the recently renovated over water villas. They wanted to get our opinion of the new room. The renovated outdoor living area is awesome and very comfortable. It used to be a little on the small side which is why we prefer the regular room with the upper private sun deck for more outdoor space. All the updates were beautiful tasteful and local. The wet areas remain amazing and luxurious. We chose to have a lunch and a breakfast at our big dining table for the ease. And the room service delivery took less then 20 minutes. AmazingThe housekeeping attendant managed to get in and out almost every time without us even knowing she was around. Our butler was helpful and even arranged for an extended checkout time without our having to request it. We planned to but he beat us to it. The beach has been enlarged in the last year and continues to be soft and white. If you have traveled to a beach destination in the last 18 months then you are aware of the seaweed issue that is plaguing all our beaches. This beach is no different. They make huge efforts to keep it clear but as in most areas it is a loosing battle. BUT they continue to fight it. The water is Mexico greens and browns. Not clear or blue go to he Bahamas for this. The sound of the surf is lovely and the service is un reachable by any other property. Even the neighboring Banyon Tree which is lovely and we did stay there once. But Rosewood is superior on all fronts. At Thanksgiving the new adult area was not quite finished and we were looking forward to seeing and using the area. It is beautiful as I would expect nothing less. There are three small pools large covered living areas tons of variety for seating styles and places. The wait staff is absolutely superior to anything you will find anywhere else. The food and drinks easy delicious and abundant. Saturday at 1 pm is a great time to be on this beach as it is champagne o clock. Who does not love free champagne. We once again did the small outdoor family style La Ceiba dinner. It is only a couple times a week so reserve your spot at least once. It is in the gorgeous herb garden under a giant lit tree. We did this dinner last time and because of that almost did not do it this time. It is very expensive about 25 per person. But the food is unique plentiful and top quality as are the drink choices. Everything is well planned and a few upper level staff join in and dine with you. Jose Maria is a favorite attendee of many returning guests. You get to speak with the head chef who also loves to pour cocktails. This hotel is ridiculously expensive and saving money once you get on property can not be one of your concerns. The best way to make full use of it is use all the amenities and services. Use your butler accept all the offerings on the beach fruit ice cream cocktails sun glass cleanings head rubs. I was bragging to Jose Maria that I felt that I could ask for anything and they would find a way to manage the request. I joked that I might ask to have dinner with a flamingo one time.
