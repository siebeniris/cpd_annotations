This unfortunately was not one of those experiences. The hotel property was in decent shape.

My wife had driven in to surprise me and visit Orlando since I was working on my birthday. Since I had a rental car for business we used that vehicle during our stay and left our car sitting in the parking lot during our stay. Upon returning home my wife noticed while unloading the car back at home that there was paint all along the side of our our new car. Its is only 1yr old. My wife immediately called the hotel to discuss this incident and left messages with Tony GM to call her back to discuss this problem. She immediately went up to the local Hyundai dealership to have them look at the paint over spray and assess the damage. They took pictures and documented all of the paint non skid on our vehicle. Roughly 120 in damage to the paint. My wife immediately sent in all the documentation to the hotel and Tony the GMAfter multiple calls to Tony he conveyed that he would pass this along to the owners of the hotel to be submitted to the insurance company to file a claim.

After multiple calls to the hotel GM Tony we find out he has no idea whom his insurance company is but he has a name to a representative.
