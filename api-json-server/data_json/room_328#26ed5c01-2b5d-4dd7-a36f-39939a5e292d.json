We stayed at the Sheraton about 2 years ago and absolutely loved the property and the service so we were greatly disappointed when we returned last week. Upon arrival we received a less than warm welcome and when enquiring if all feather linen and bedding had been removed from our room as per the request we made at time of booking I was advised it had not yet been done we arrived at 830pm and not so much as an apology was offered. As I am highly allergic I said we would wait at the bar whilst this was sorted out. They advised this would take 10 15 minutes. 30 minutes later it still was not ready and I had to go down to reception to follow it up again not a single apology for the inconvenience. The Room itself was still well decorated and clean but a lot smaller than our previous room it had also only been set up for one occupant no complimentary water or wifi was offered nor slippers which is usually a standard for a Hotel of this calibre. Our Room was meant to be a city view room instead we looked directly onto a dirty wall. The Shower pressure was very bad and the singular robe although we were two guests had what appeared to be make up marks around the neck area. The none feather pillows were so hard and thin that we landed up sleeping without them. I usually do not shy away from placing a direct complaint at the hotel if something is not in order but after the service we received upon check in I thought it would be a waste of our time and we were utterly exhausted by the time we got back to our room later that night. We were really sad that our experience was so awful as we were so fond of the property the first time round. perhaps management has changed since then but I am quite certain we will not be back.", "offset": [992, 1079], "date": "2015-02-09", "cpt": "0", "category": "room"}, {"id": 3, "uid": "8acc5653-b8b8-4236-8a0c-e01af79254ce", "sentence": "Everything costs extra do not book with children.

The best the manager did was offer us the fold away bed for 50 per night. We had to accept as had already paid up front for the room. On top of 55 a day for parking too which apparently is an extra not included in our booking it turned out very expensive so beware extra charges.

I am unsure why all of the reviews are good on this hotel. The hotel lobby and suites are updated and nice but the actual rooms are NOT 5 star at all.

It would be fine if the price was lower but if you are truly wanting a 4 5 star experience then pay the small amount more and go with ANY of the others. I also requested a king bed and this hotel gave me two singles with a tv that turned off every 2 minutes and a view of an alley. I asked for an upgrade and had to pay 150 for it.

This was the first time I had stayed at this hotel for quite a few years. I have had to look for alternatives to my normal hotel as their prices have become ridiculous.

At the Sheraton I stayed in a king room city view and was surprised by the large size of the room. The bathroom in particular was great large marble well equipped and a separate shower with excellent water flow. The bed was comfortable but the pillows not and the air conditioning effective. Check in was efficient although I did feel a little pressure to upgrade for an extra 60 I did not. The room had no view but that did not matter to me.

Hit and miss. Mixed feelings each time I stay here as per other reviews. Its normally about the cheapest of the 5 stars in the area and has a great location but then so do the others. Rooms are a bit dated. Our park view room did actually have a view of the park this time be careful some of the park view rooms are misleading and essentially have a view of a tree. However we were allocated an end of corridor room which was smaller than most and had a smaller bathroom. This was luck of the draw I guess but removed one of the main benefits of the hotel larger rooms and bathrooms as its an older dated property when they made rooms bigger. I understand they are renovating soon its needed too. Hope they replace beds too as they are getting old and our twin beds moved around so much. Feast restaurant staff breakfast mainly were as bad as on every single previous visit. Hard to attract attention no care and you had wait for ages to get anything. Having mentioned this several times over the last year or more I guess its just how it is others have the same complaint when talking to other guests. Its a shame as food is great. I sat in the downstairs restaurant for 25 mins before anyone asked if I had like to order and only then because I called them over. Room service was fine but every order they missed or forgot something forgot cutlery sauces. Of 3 orders none actually arrived with everything they should have. In summary FB service needs work and that s been my experience on each and every visit so its not a one off. Nice gym pool spa area. All in all its a OK option if you can get a good deal but if the price is the same as say the Hilton Swisotel QT which are all close by then I had probably choose one of the others. There is nothing that sets it apart. Its all just OK. If you do not stay in 5 star hotels regularly you may not notice any of this but I suspect seasoned leisure and business travellers choose other options which may be why its one of the lower priced 5 stars in the area despite the Sheraton brand and excellent location.

The hotel enjoys a nice location facing Hyde Park and a couple of meters away from the Elizabeth st exit of St James train station. It is only one stop away from Circular Quay and a few stops direct from Sydney airport. Upon arrival I was quickly greeted by an eager bellman who lugged my bag and lead me to check in. There was no queue at check in and it was prompt. Whilst my suite was n\u2019t ready I was quickly provided a card to freshen up in the health club showers and the club lounge. The Deluxe Terrace Suite was as advertised. 3 balconies with furniture dramatic views a dining area for 5 work desk huge sofa and bed with a view. The dramatic marble bathroom and shower features Herm\u00e8s toiletries which are a favourite. The bed was supremely comfy while the walk in wardrobe had a strange armoire which seems like an after thought. No complaints over the quality of room or renovations. A guest power room was also off the entrance. The Sheraton Club lounge is certainly one of the most impressive hotel executive club lounges I have ever been to. Dramatic windows and views and the evening cocktail hour should not be missed. The prawns and oysters sushi spread and other cooked food was constantly refilled and my glass was never dry. In addition to 3 reds 3 whites and a sparkling wine there was an assortment of other liquor and beers. Service was also prompt and ever so eager to please. I had breakfast at Feast the hotel \u2019s main restaurant. Service levels seem to vary daily as most of the staff seem to change. It ranged from disinterested grumpy to super nice and efficient. On the first day the host seemed to be in dreamland and actually appeared grogyThe spread includes a nice self service juicer avocado and other repeating items. It got boring by day 2. Some offerings did not make sense on day 3 there was no congee yet most of the toppings beside it was meant for congee. whoever has miso soup with ground nuts and meat flosThere was also some missed opportunities to make the stay extra special in many full service Mariots and Starwod hotels the hotel manager would normally send a short welcome note or welcome appreciation reaching out to Titanium members but this was absent.
