I have stayed at this property several times over the months I am a Diamond Hilton member so I stay at quite a few Hilton brand hotels in the area for work. I have to say there are definitely opportunities for this property to really be one of the best hotels in the area but it really is not there yet. Business CenterMy first stay here I had a super frustrating experience with the Business Center where my presentation was printed on dirty paper it had someones boarding pass on the other side seriously and the printer was missing ink. I also had to pay to use the business center and the computers did not have updated software it literally used such an old form of Internet Explorer that I could only access Gmail in HTML mode. Thankfully the most recent experience was significantly better there was a working printer with all of the ink available and clean paper. The computers are still using an old form of Internet Explorer it is 2015. Update your software already but I was prepared for that so my blood pressure did not go up as it did the first time around. Printing a presentation for my meetings would be free at every other Hilton property in the area but I had to pay 7 for it here. Whatever it is what it is. Hotel GymThis has one of the better hotel gyms in the area. I am a huge fan of the updated treadmills. But none of the personal tvs work which is odd. HousekepingI keep my tooth brush in a cup whenever I am staying at a hotel. Housekeeping dumped out my toothbrush onto the bathroom counter when they were cleaning so that they could return the cup to the top of the fridge. That was ODD. And the chaise in the room was noticeably stained which did not make me comfortable to sit there. RomI highly suggest the executive floor with the lounge they offer breakfast and bottled sodas and waters throughout the day. I do not know why it would not be open at night but it closes at 10 pm. The TVs in the rooms also have really spotty cable so to access HGTV or the Travel channel is a struggle.

Only a 1 night stay at this hotel but enough to write a review. When I pulled in i had to pull off the road to allow the local firefighters to get ahead of me. As I pulled into the parking lot the second engine arrived and then the third. Not too unusual yet. But pulling in to check in when the people were streaming out was a little disconcerting. But I have been around so I do not rattle easily. Turns out that a guy taking a REALLY hot steamy shower tripped the smoke detector as I was told by the fire guys. Still okay with that. There was a big church event so they had to stop the concert and all leave the building. Okay I get it. But when the fire guys say it happens often that is not acceptable. They were used to going to the hotel and dealing with this issue. Hilton folks you got ta fix this sensitive alarm. Unfair to guests to have to drop everything and leave. Then after the evacuation the people had to return to their rooms but the line for the 3 elevators was backed up. I had just checked in. And realized I would have to wait for at least 30 minutes to drop my bags and try to get food. It was about 8PM2 tour buses had also just arrived with a full complement of Asian tourists. Unfortunately the only restaurant open was the bar and lounge. Hm. I wondered about that. Then I found out that 1 elevator was not working. HmThe room was big and the accommodations were nice. There is a nice pool and workout room is okay as well. The hotel is big enough but I think it needs a process refresh. Although the room layout was good and the features of the room were also better than other hotels in the area I found a few too many remnants of the last guest under the covers.

Mr Ryan Philips is wonderful and understands customer service with 5 gold stars. Rooms are update date with lovely walk in showers and space to move about. That is all the positives I have. I arrived to this hotel during an area heat wave. The local weather was 90 plus degrees with 85 plus humidity. Horribly oppressive weather. My room AC was set to 60 degrees however it was far warmer than that. Thanks to an ap on my phone I knew it was 84 degrees. I called the front desk requested maintenance. Thirty minutes later no maintenance. I called the front desk again. After an hour I called again now I have been waiting for one hour. The front desk manager was condescending and rude young with no understanding how customer service works. Maintenance finally arrives and I am essentially informed sorry nothing we can do. Annoyed I left for dinner. I stopped by the lobby and spoke to Mr Philips who was wonderful and fully understood my position. Upon returning from dinner my room was wait for it even hotter. I called the front desk again and was again told maintenance was on their way. Twenty five minutes later no maintenance. I would say I am shocked here however I was not. The maintenance employee came into my room removed the HVAC cover plate and I was disgusted to see 1 2 of black and grey dust. At this point the employee began to blow the dust into my room to clean it. I stopped him as this was not acceptable. Then with my bed one foot from the HVAC unit he began to spray a chemical. When I asked him what it was he said I do not know its a chemical. At this point I stopped him as I was done with this hotel. I called around and 6 hotels later I was able to get a room at another Hilton 25 mins away. So at 1030pm I left this terrible room and headed to my new hotel.

Food was being refreshed every few minutes and it provided several teenagers with all different preferences and options that satisfied everyone. After returning from our night out in Boston the teens took to the pool which was very clean and not too Chlorine drenched as some hotels do. They felt comfortable with their surroundings and enjoyed taking in a quick night swim. I am pleasantly pleased with the insulation of each room. Having several teenage girls I was leery of their noise level and bothering other around us. I am pleasantly pleased that I did not hear their voices or their music in my room that adjoined theirs.

Hope they give the rooms an update.", "offset": [1361, 1396], "date": "2019-12-09", "cpt": "2", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 29, "uid": "4921515b-b035-4aa7-831c-d7f3c7f7b025", "sentence": "The getaway. Location on the hotel is in a perfect spot being very close to the highways and just North of Boston service was impeccable the rooms could use some updating especially the bathrooms where the tiles on the floors need to be fixed.", "offset": [13, 243], "date": "2019-12-09", "cpt": "2", "category": "renovation"}]}
