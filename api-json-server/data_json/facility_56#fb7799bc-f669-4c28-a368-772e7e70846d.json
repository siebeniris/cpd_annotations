I said we booked specifically for the pool. She said it closed in November. I said there \u2019s a picture online. She got rude and said I looked at another site. I showed her it on their site on my browser. She replied \u201c Well it \u2019s not on the desktop page. Call customer service \u201d. Customer service said contact Expedia. The Expedia agent said their website was updated and did n\u2019t show a pool. I said it was there when I booked. I spoke to a supervisor who told me twice the site no longer showed a pool. I told her the same thing I told the previous agent. I was put told to talk to the hotel. I said they told me to contact Expedia. She called the hotel and then said to go downstairs to see Kim. I went downstairs and the rude worker asked if I needed something. I told her I was to talk to Kim. That changed her attitude and she rushed off.

Currently staying at the Westin for a conference. The location is a short walk to the convention center. For background I am a loyal customer of the Westin chain and have stayed at several of their properties across the US. In a nutshell the New Orleans facility is far below par. My experience has prompted me to do something that I \u2019ve not done before actually write a review before my stay is complete. I \u2019l explain below. I arrived for check in at 2 pm and was promptly informed that they had no rooms available at the time. They were kind enough to hold my luggage. I confirmed that they had my loyalty program details which they did. No acknowledgement of my business or gold elite status was offered. Thought that they were saving it for the actual check in. After a long day at the conference returned to find an unattended reception desk. Another guest who was clearly irate for his own reasons had to yell to get attention. At this point the staff had their second opportunity to rectify the aforementioned issues. I explained that I was checking in. The receptionist rather casually printed off two keys without providing any further details of my room directions to said room or any of the amenities. No instructions provided by staff or in room to access WiFi I \u2019m literally using my cellular data to upload this. I presumed that based on my prior discussion I would get an upgraded room. But boy was I wrongThe first clue was that I was not put on a preferred guest floor. The moment I walked in I was struck by the musty smell of old carpet. The theme continued in the form of really old furniture tired and stained bedding and the unusual absence of any USB terminals. The bathroom vanity old and cracked. The grout is horendously discolored suggesting a lack of cleaning andor insidious mold. Sensing a mistake I called the front desk and was rather promptly informed that there were no upgrades or alternate rooms. Had I not been traveling solo I would have asked to speak to a manager. However given the general apathy and ineptitude of the staff I shudder to think of interacting with their leadership. Also I am too exhausted to care at this point. For 80 for 2 nights I think anyone who reserves a room here deserves much better. To reiterate my previous assertion this facility is not fit to bear the Westin name for either service or room standards. Would not stay here unles major changes are made. Hope that Westin is aware of these problems and is working to fix them.
