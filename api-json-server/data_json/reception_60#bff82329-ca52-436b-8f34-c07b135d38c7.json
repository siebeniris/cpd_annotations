Elegant and relaxing. Overview. We have spent time at a number of resorts in the Caribbean and Little Dix Bay is our favorite. We tend toward smaller secluded resorts with lots of space. While Little Dix Bay is n\u2019t small 105 rooms. it certainly feels that way. Even when the resort is full the beaches and restaurants are never crowded. This is because the resort is spread out and the rooms are well spaced. There were times we felt like we were at our own private resort. If you are the type that likes total privacy the resort will drop you off whenever you would like at a secluded beach with snorkel equipment lunch towels and an umbrella. The water is blue warm and since there is a protective reef just off shore the water is calm even when the ocean is not. While each feature of Little Dix Bay is n\u2019t perfect none are less than very good. Overall Little Dix Bay offers the most of everything we look for in a Caribbean resort. To sum it up in a single word Little Dix Bay is Elegant. Outstanding features of Little Dix Bay are the staff best we have experienced the food the accommodations water and consistency. They provide the same exceptional experience year in and year out. Less than outstanding feature the connections and travel getting there. Getting there There are many ways to travel to Little Dix Bay but none of them are direct. We flew to San Juan then took a small plane to Tortola. Little Dix Bay has a water taxi very close to the airport that takes you to the resort in about 20 minutes. If there is a delay in your flight it can be a long day of traveling. Our rating for getting there is 3The property The property is beautiful and very well maintained. While the staff will pick you up in a golf cart and take you wherever you would like to go sometimes it is just nice to walk and enjoy the scenery. Our rating for the property is 5The rooms We were in room 80 which was upstairs and at the very end of the resort. This means there is n\u2019t a lot of traffic. We enjoyed the privacy but our room was the furthest from the grill restaurant and spa which some may not like. Our room was large with a king sized bed large bathroom a walk in closet and plenty of drawer space. We also had a balcony that overlooked the ocean. The balcony was furnished with a futon table and chairs. The room was very well appointed and the staff kept the room spotless all during our stay. The rooms vary in size but all are close to the beach and the ocean. We suggest looking a map of the property when booking to ensure your room meets your needs. Our rating for the rooms is 5The Food We found the overall quality of the food to be very good to excellent. The breakfast is a buffet at the pavilion and lunch and dinner was a la carte at 2 different locations and a buffet at the Pavilion. They also serve afternoon tea at 430PM. The breakfast buffet was as you would expect at a resort the usual offerings with an egg station. We thought the quality of the buffet was very good. The menus for lunch and dinner were quite varied and the quality of the food was always excellent. We ate a la cart at the Sugar Mill each night. They did not over cook the entrees which is the case with some other resorts in the Caribbean. Both the fish and meat entrees were excellent. Lunch prices were reasonable and dinner entrees were on the high side ranging from 35 to 75. Our rating for food quality is 5. Our rating for value for the money is 3Staf Simply put Little Dix Bay has one of the finest if not the finest staff in the Caribbean. Everyone was extremely friendly professional and helpful. They could not have been more accommodating. Of special mention was Tito who was very attentive and thoughtful. The housekeeping staff was amazing and kept our room spotless. Our rating for the staff is 5The Beach and the water The beach is quite long and narrow in spots. The beach chairs are in a single row and well spaced. As a result the beach never appears crowded even when the resort is full. The sand is fine with little seaweed. The only issue with the beach is that it could be policed better in the AM. Walking on the beach in the morning you see floating mats everywhere sometimes in the water or under the dock. Also the chairs are not taken in or moved back at night so the bottom of the chairs can be buried in the sand or in disarray due to the tide. The water is blue calm warm and shallow. This is one of the best features of the resort. Because of a protective reef the water can be quite calm when the ocean is not. Spending time in the water is one of the many reasons to come to Little Dix Bay. The only negative regarding the water is that the snorkeling is not that great around the resort. That said if you want better snorkeling the resort will take you out to different beaches free of charge. Our rating of the beach is 4 and water is 5. The Spa. The spa Sense is a world class spa. It is relaxing and the staff attends to every detail. We had 2 treatments while there and both were excellent. Our rating of the spa is 5The gym The resort has a very nice and fairly large gym with an assortment of cardio and weight equipment. Our rating of the gym is 4Other activities There are activities like kayaking sailing paddle boarding snorkeling and assorted beach games that are free of charge. The resort offers many other activities like diving or a boat cruise at an extra cost. Our rating of the activities is 5Things to know before you go Insects \u2013 compared to other Islands and resorts in the Caribbean Little Dix Bay has fewer flies and insects but they are still present. While the resort supplies bug repellant we suggest bringing your own. An itch relieving lotion is also helpful. Rooms. The resort is not large but is spread out. If you have special needs or want to be closer to restaurant spa or pool you should request those rooms ahead of time. We suggest looking at a map of the property before booking. While all the rooms are quite nice location does make a difference if you have children do n\u2019t want stairs or want a little more privacy. That said the golf cart service is very easy and efficient.", "offset": [3749, 3811], "date": "2015-02-18 00:00:00", "cpt": "0", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 6, "uid": "cc25bfaf-1479-4a3a-ac8d-8e871ee89591", "sentence": "can not beat the beach.

This facility by a very thin hair is a close 2nd to Canel Bay Resort. We stayed at Saba Rock for 6 days and rented a villa for 2 weeks on St John visiting both resorts. Obviously we were not residing at either but rented vehicles or taxis on both islands. We dropped in here one day while exploring The Valley of Virgin Gorda and while making a reservation for dinner took in the facilities during the off season. Both have immaculate facilities with a Frank Lloyd Wright look to the architecture with beautifully kept grounds and beaches. The service food and scenery are one of a kind at both and exemplary. The difference being Canel Bay Resort has much larger grounds with several private beaches plus the added benefit of exploring Cruz Bay Coral Bay and several other National Park beaches on the island. Whereas Little Dix Bay Resort has one beach but there is also The Baths The North Sound Gorda Peak and a few other beaches to see. Some very tough choices here. In hindsight it would have been easier staying at Little Dix versus Saba Rock which is built on an island in the North Sound. Accessible by boat or helicopter. timing transportation and logistics are a little tougher from Saba. Either Rockefeller resort would make for an excellent choice for a vacation destination. Or do yourself a favor and stay at both see the sites.

The setting alone is the reason to return. This is a very relaxing place. Since it was our first visit we did not quite understand how everything worked but figured it out within a day or two. The transport from Beef Island after our fight was good the cocktail offered on the boat was much appreciated after a long day. The meet and greet on the dock with transport to our room was great. nice that they were waiting for us. We stayed in 58 and while not the largest we may have had one of the best views. We truly felt like this was a great choice to spend our 30th anniversary. We spent most of our days on the property with one day at The Baths. We hiked both trails and enjoyed that. We did the complimentary water activities on the beach. Breakfast was in The Pavilion and we ordered off the menu. Several employees in The Pavilion were quite engaging although a few seemed a bit lackadaisical with us. We enjoyed the daily newspaper. We lunched on the beach and ordered drinks daily which were very refreshing. One or two dinners were at The Pavilion my husband had a buffet once and then otherwise we ordered off the menu. We had a beach dinner for our anniversary the setting was quite special the service good. The Creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e and Caesar salad were memorable but my husbands surf and turf disappointing my lamb was good enough. Otherwise we ate outside of the resort. While I am sure you would agree leaving the property is a good way to enjoy the culture the food was better off property and a better value. We particularly enjoyed Coco Maya and ate dinner there twice. A beautiful setting creative food with a good value and excellent service. Housekeeping in our room was a bit hit and miss. with the first day almost not done somehow they forgot about us. Daily water delivery was missed a few days. When housekeeping did come the room was done very well. Rosewood will have to do a better job with their food with the challenge of not necessarily charging more money. The food at Little Dix is already expensive. it just needs to be more creative. the setting is there. We hope to returnPS. The gift shop was great.

Where to start. When we first arrived we admired the grounds and the landscaping. The chickens free roaming added some charm to the experience. I particularly loved that the front desk was not in an overly grand and pretentious lobby. We adored everyone we met from the moment we got there. Our butlers were wonderful and extremely helpful. I can not say enough about how they went out of their way to make sure we had the best experience possible. Every single person who helped us on the beach was kind and seemed genuinely happy to be there. Everyone who was in the restaurant was very attentive and always made sure to accommodate our requests. I looked forward to meals every day because it meant we could see our new friends and chat about the day. No one ever made me feel like I was in their way. Our housekeepers were incredibly sweet and always came at times that would be least obstructive for us. they are sneaky. The wonderful men who run the vegetable garden are the most kindhearted people anyone could ever meet. I loved to come visit them and I was never made to feel as if I were disrupting anything. Sure a previous reviewer said the garden was not completely ready to sustain a complete farm to table experience but in their defense the garden is a very young garden and the gardeners had to make do with what they had to get it going. After all this is an island recovering from a hurricane without many of the luxuries we might have stateside ie local growers and suppliers. Yes the website does imply that one might be able to enjoy a farm to table meal at the Sugar Mill. I do not take off any points for this. The spa was exactly how a spa should be. the staff was incredibly welcoming and the views are breathtakingThe rooms were absolutely perfect. We had a TV in the living room that could stream from our own devices no live TV service but we did not need it. I might have used it once to watch something on Netflix and then never touched it again. We spent the rest of our time at the beach. The beds were comfortable and the linens were divine. Maybe I might have enjoyed something on our back porch so I could wash the sand off my feet before going back inside but the suites are tastefully outfitted and decorated. We stayed in a one bedroom suite and were mere steps from the beach and the restaurant too. In the interest of full disclosure there were a couple of things the resort was still working on during our stay. We were not aware not everything was fully functioning although none of these things detracted from our experience I would advise everyone to keep an open mind and understand that the resort just reopened. The dive center was not functional yet. Our butler informed us that they would be happy to arrange a dive trip for us while the dive center is still being outfitted. We decided not to dive. We loved our snorkel trips with Captain Avery enough that we did not feel like we were missing out on anything. We were also not aware that not all of the dining facilities were ready yet. Again it did NOT negatively impact our stay but might be worth noting for future travelers. The beach menu was the best in my opinion. Breakfast at The Pavilion was wonderful. The buffet breakfast was excellent. We only ordered a la carte two times during our one week stay for breakfast. While we were there lunch could only be had on the beach in room or at The Sugar Mill. Dinner could only be had at The Pavilion. I enjoyed the dinners we had at The Pavilion however I would note that there might not be enough familiarity if you are looking for more classic European or American fare. that is just my observation. Not a negative thing. Apologies for the long review and lack of eloquent writing. I just really wanted to leave the resort a five star review and see them get back on their feet after a long rebuild as we truly did enjoy our stay and would recommend Rosewood for anyone interested in a truly pampered experience.", "offset": [1795, 1907], "date": "2020-02-15 00:00:00", "cpt": "1", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 13, "uid": "227430ee-bac6-4a4a-96be-888d09b99a19", "sentence": "Too expensive for a resort just re opening and clearly struggling with staffing.

This was the second week of Little Dix being fully operational after two months of a soft opening and we found that there were still many issues to be worked out.

For example one evening it took over half an hour for cocktails we had ordered before our dinner to be served. When they were delivered they were undrinkable and had to be sent back to be remade. Another morning they lost our order and it took multiple requests for the food to arrive. We also eventually started keeping track of how many different people and different times at each meal we were asked for our room number because it actually became funny but the average was at least three times at each meal. Overall the food quality at the Pavilion was weak and the lack of chardonnay anywhere on property seemed quite odd and disappointing. The food quality on the tapas menu at the sugar Mill however was actually quite good. The rooms have all been refurbished but we were very disappointed with both the design and quality. The mattress was very uncomfortable. We travel all over the world and sleep in hotels more than 100 nights a year. This is the first time that we have encountered a mattress we would consider worth complaining about. The HVAC system was also incredibly loud and was not well calibrated. Finally the design and decor of the room was disappointing. There was virtually no closet or drawer space which seems poor planning since many customers would stay for several nights or a week. There was more space dedicated to a mini bar station than to closet space. The decor was extremely generic and could be found in any hotel anywhere. We miss the way the rooms were previously designed with an eye towards a west indian vibe. Also missing were any kind of outside footbaths or system for rinsing sandy feet. The previous version of the rooms had this and it seems to be a major oversight in a high end beach resort room. The butler program which is intended to be a luxurious amenity was actually so poorly executed that it made our visit worse rather than better. The butlers did not give us an adequate introduction to the property room services etc. upon arrival and had we not been there before we would have been totally lost. Then when we did seek to use their services we had trouble finding them and getting any sort of timely response. However we kept being channeled through the butler whenever we wanted to book anything but we could find him and then we we did he never came back to confirm one way or the other whether he was able to arrange for what we had asked so we would have to track him down again for the follow up. In any event our butler experience was totally unacceptable. While not unavoidable it was also frustrating to have all the water out on the property one evening right before dinner so that we were not able to shower. In fact i was fully soaped up and shampooed in the shower when all the water stopped and i had to rinse off in the ocean.", "offset": [157, 389], "date": "2020-02-22 22:34:58", "cpt": "1", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 15, "uid": "0107e7a8-8f99-4ab5-a693-abcf39be4689", "sentence": "We have visited Little Dix at least a half dozen times over the course of 30 years and this was our first poor experience.

This is a difficult review to write as we wanted our experience to be truly outstanding. In some respects it was but in too many areas it was not yet up to Rosewood standards. Part of the problem is that the hotel opened up only two months before we arrived after a multi year renovation and much of the staff was still learning their roles. While I am only giving the hotel an average rating we will likely come back if we see that the ratings on TA improve. Positive aspects. the grounds and the beach are truly beautiful. The beach staff was fantastic and delivered first class service. The ocean view suite we had was spacious. I did not like the furniture as. it was low to the ground and not comfortable for a person like me who is 64. I felt like I was in munchkin land. Negative aspects Room service was spotty. We had breakfast in our room each day and during our 8 day trip 3 of the breakfasts were not right. They had either the wrong or incomplete order. Very frustrating to get coffee but they forget to bring coffee cups. Restaurants. The hotel has three restaurants. Our favorite was the Reef which is at the end of the pier where the boat docks. We had a few meals at the Pavilion but we did not find the food as good as the Reef. Another problem with the Pavilion is that most of the dining chairs are too low to the ground. Again not comfortable for a person of my size. Butler service. This is something new to me where literally everything you do in terms of meal reservations special requests breakfast orders go through this one indivdual. Personally I did not like it. Much prefer the old way where you have a concierge desk. etc. Also in our case we were going back to the USA on a private jet from the Tortola airport and I asked our butler where the private jets leave from. He told me to go to the main terminal and our pilots would find us. Fortunately on the way over we checked with our van driver who took us from the LDB boat to the airport and he took us to the FBO which was before the main terminal. Had I not checked with the van driver we would have been let off in the wrong place. Last point. We had an ocean view suite but did not realize at the time of booking that this would be on the second floor of a two story building. My wife who is physically challenged had a very difficult time getting up and down the stairs especially since there were no hand rails. In the future we will insist on a ground floor room. I truly hope LDB gets their act together as we would like to return.", "offset": [212, 377], "date": "2020-03-17 00:00:00", "cpt": "1", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 19, "uid": "8aa85db0-667e-40c5-a8bd-f1def0c8b653", "sentence": "The beach setting and landscaping are beautiful as ever. Heres our takeaway 1. Restaurant issues. Service in the pavilion and sugar mill was absolutely atrocious. This was a common discussion amongst the guests. Lovely people but absolutely NO service training. Servers routinely all but ignored a seated table finally meandered over had to ask for water numerous times and absolutely NO familiarity with the menus. Food was delivered partially eg. eggs arrived with toast coming way after bagels with no butter or jelly etc. Burgers with no ketchup despite asking several times. Like pulling teeth to place a simple order. At lunch while ordering something directly from the menu the server looked as if we were ordering something from the moon. And a salad at lunch salad with added shrimp. 46. Really. 2. Rooms were very nice except for closet space was crazy small for two people. Fire extinguisher and ironing board took much of the space and only room to hang a few items. 3 Fitness center why does not the tennis fitness director organize some group activities. That used to be the gem of LDB. He could send out notice for group picklebal round robin tennis etc. He only seemed interested in teaching lessons. 4 Concierge a nice service but WAY overdone. Really do not see the need for a dedicated concierge. And using What s Ap to connect. Many guests DO NOT use What s Ap. That is such an awkward way to connect. Text or email so much easier.", "offset": [1217, 1261], "date": "2020-03-20 02:34:08", "cpt": "1", "category": "reception"}]}
