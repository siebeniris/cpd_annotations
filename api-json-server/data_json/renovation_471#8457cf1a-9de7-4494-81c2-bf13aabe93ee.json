During the stay key cards did not work properly and had to be changed several times which was a massive loss of time due to the room being located far away from reception. As mentioned in other reviews and quite surprisingly for an hotel of that level calls to service desk are sometimes not answered or not answered promptly.

Dear Mr Klauser My fianc\u00e9 and I have stayed with the hotel for close to 60 days approximately SGD35 K spent. Overall experience was a mixture of great and not so great occasions. Definitely many inconsistency among the services and hospitality provided by different employees. Gratitude and well deserved compliments to the following employees for their great efforts and awesome attitudes that made them great role models of the hotel1. Waterfall Sandy Vickies Jermane and a few others ie chef sous chef at breakfast. Their diligence and proactivenes in serving the diners at breakfast were remarkable. Sandy and Vickies were always attentive listened and remembered our preferences. Their consistency impressed me. Well done2 Room service Farah who is always attentive listened and ensure our orders are correct. Well done. The Caesar salad was one of the very few best Caesar salad I had thus far. Lettuces were crisp and fresh3. Garden wings. Michele and Chloe were nice and accommodating in general. Sihan on the other hand was attentive listened and took the additional effort and care every now and then following up to ensure things were ok and our needs were met. She impressed me. Well done Sihan. 4. Pool great pool and one two very attentive pool attendant Martin is one of them. Unfortunately there were quite a number of unpleasant occasions and inconsistent services which I had encountered and found them quite unbelievable 1. The Line 1st morning breakfast on 4 June which was shocking. Nobody was manning the counter which left me and my fianc\u00e9 unattended for close to 5 mins. We walked in ourselves and informed one of the waiter of our room no. Many of the waitresses seem to be very busy but gave no warmth and attention. I had my detailed story separately and specially posted on The Line. Very bad impression for a start of my stay2. Room service There are other instances which food were delayed to be served noodles were dry due to being in the warmer for quite some time order being placed for two dishes but only one was brought up to the room and the other was forgotten and sent close to the first dish was about to finish. that is the inconsistency I am relating to. Hainanese Chicken Rice was disappointing and the crockery used to serve the chicken was impractical crampeddificult to dish and eat3. Waterfall 5 June 2nd day of breakfast was yet again not a very good impression which my detailed story was posted separately on Waterfall. Patronage the outlet for an early dinner one day and the carbonara was very salty that my fianc\u00e9 only had a few bites. He did not bother to request for fresh one to be cooked as it left a bad taste to him4. Maintenance one fine morning when my fianc\u00e9 and I were still in our sleep and the privacy light was on there was one ring at the door bell followed by somebody attempt to open and walk into our room. Fortunate enough that we put on the safety latch me in my sleepwear jumped up in shock to have to rush to the door yelling to stop them while they were half way forcing pushing the door open. I have to put half of my hand out yelling and pointing at the privacy light that was on for them to realise their unbelievable mistake. Horrible inded5. Housekeeping inconsistency on and off every different day where some items ie water floor mat face towel etc. were not replenished. Minibar items simply being charged without consuming without even bother checking clarifying with us eg items consumed by previous stay guest billed to us due to change move of room during Arsenal group check in6. A copy of my fully settled bill it was beyond my imagination for me to get a soft copy of my bill correctly after my check out. Numerous errors and mistakes made by several different staff continuously that taken almost 2 days for me to finally get the correct soft copy of the bill. Challenging indeed when the employees were lack of courteous and consistency to check and ensure the document is correct before sending over to me. Shangr Lla is a well known brand however if every employee of the hotel does not take pride and live up in providing consistent services throughout this will most definitely disappoint and shatter the expectation of the guests who have chosen the hotel to spend money for their stay.", "offset": [2725, 2924], "date": "2015-08-04", "cpt": "0", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 4, "uid": "0d3e2283-8635-40ad-81e0-35bfbbda2b19", "sentence": "Very old shady place.

Our stay here was disappointing having stayed previously I know it could have been better. We booked a garden wing room with breakfast to be taken at the Waterfall. I received an email saying we had been upgraded to the Valley Wing initial excitement ceased when I realised it was just the room to take advantage of the facilities we would need to pay extra. Breakfast was to be taken at the Line. On arrival we were told that although we had stated a non smoking room a smoking room had been refreshed would we look at it. We were taken to the room as soon as th door was opened there was an overwhelming smell of smoke. So totally unsuitable. We returned to reception after a lengthy search we we told there was another room but it would be a good hour before ready. We were offered breakfast. Finishing breakfast it still was not ready we said where we would wait and expected to be told when the room was ready. We were not. Eventually I returned to reception and was handed a key and told our baggage would be sent up. It was not. We then had to ask for it to be brought. Whilst the food choice at breakfast in the Line was good it was not a relaxing experience having to queue when you wanted food and it certainly was not peaceful as we had expected in the Waterfall. Pool service was pretty non existent. Checking out we asked twice for our bags to be collected it took 35 minutes we were the only people checking out at that time. So whilst the room was large and well equipped the view was grim overall our stay did not match expectation. We have stayed in many Shangri La hotels and this is the first poor review I have made.

You can even enjoy foot reflexology whilst lazing by the pool. It was interesting to see a hotel having an outlet that sold cakes and pastries as well as some cooking condiments that could be bought as souvenirs to bring home.

Having been to this hotel for decades and having been a regular whilst living in Singapore we decided to return to this hotel for a recent vacation. Arrived to a foyer in chaotic state and to slow service at the reception. Had booked 6 nights in Horizon Club and was eventually checked in there. We are Golden Circle Members and Platinum Amex and booked under Amex Fine Hotels and Resorts program which includes a room upgrade on arrival. Which we initially did not get although rooms were available. We were also disappointed with the changes in Horizon Club with a huge number of families with small children with several children not under the control of their parents running around two nearly running into me from the same family. Add the downgrading Of Champagne to the cheaper Proseco a casual and unenforced dress code during happy hour and an ambience more suitable to the local watering hole with too many guzzling down booze like they were going to get their worth no matter what at the now help yourself bar during cocktail hour and we were rather disappointed with this first impression. The move away from personalised table service and a reduction is staff was evident. This is not the Shangri La calm we knew and loved and expected. This is not us. We discussed the changes with Melissa in Horizon Club she was empathetic and calm and listened to both the positives noted further down and negatives. she did get the room upgrade we requested and arranged for a lovely tower room with Valley Wing privileges and were later moved over into a Valley Wing Room 3 days later due to a delagation taking up rooms in VW. Both rooms were exceptional but entirely different but Melissa in Horizon Club and her colleague Rachel really did provide exceptional service. Needless to say so did Valley Wing employees these staff restored our faith in the Shangri La whilst we initially regretted staying here we left feeling glad we did and had a wonderful stay. A note to management we were sad to see Blu gone and an obvious change from attracting the business clientele to more families we could not help but notice staff were doing their best to please everyone during this transitional phase and more staff are needed. The now help yourself bar in Horizon Club is a worry and the quality has dropped for a quantity solution not good In our opinion. The food at Horizon Club was a substantial offering. The renovations to the lounge makes it too large but it is tasteful renovation with good seating. The renovation to the foyer was needed and overall good the new staff uniform makes it hard for guests to notice them for help on arrival they are too subtle and. blend in with guests too much. The tower rooms were modernised to an excellent standard are comfortable very clean and frankly hard to fault. The rooms we had were exceptionally quiet. We hope the Tower rooms stand the test of time and the added wear and tear of so many families. The Valley Wing rooms are comfortable and still very classy but showing their age in places although being very well maintained. Please keep this place classy when you renovate. Breakfast at VW was a joy as was cocktail hour. Canap\u00e9s are lovely. Beverage quality high. Please consider the music the harpist is truely lovely and provides a graceful atmosphere but after 6 nights of the same 10 songs it is a little too much of the same thing. Whilst we understand the move to attract families this does not go well with the Shangri La that was peaceful and graceful. The foyer is loud the Horizon Club sometimes is a playpen the pool is saturated in left belongings as lounge chairs are being reserved by guests who do not appear by the pool for hours on most days or they roll up for 2 min juggle a few items around and stroll of to breakfast to return when it suits them. Particularly the lounges near the pool and in the shade. The pool particularly has and a reduction in staff and with less staff it creates a difficult environment for both them and the guests. The gym locker area and hot tub does look dated and uninviting. Without exception we can not fault any staff member in the Shangri La particularly Melissa the pool attendant that has been there well over 20 plus years the Waterfall Restaunt staffer who replaced my meal because I messed up and the Manager that was also very interactive and too Housekeeping that kept our rooms immaculate amongst others. I also met several of your Singapore finance delegate guests by accident in the elevator which were friendly and engaging and apologetic for blocking my door and these people and your staff reminded me off what is good about Singapore its people.
