Manager does not Respond. I love staying at Mariot Hotels and normally have good or great experiences. However this stay unfortunately ended very unprofesionaly. It began when I checked out of the room on the Friday morning before the start of the Memorial Day weekend. That morning I was involved in a vehicle accident and was very flustered. After checking out I had driven about three hours from the hotel when I realized that I had forgotten something in my room. I checked out at aprox. 1030 am and it was now aprox. 130 pm. I immediately called the hotel and informed them that I left a very important item in my room and I informed them exactly where the item was in the room. It was very visible and difficult to miss in the front room as soon as you opened the door. I was told that housekeeping was still cleaning the room and would locate my item and bring it to lost and found. I would then get a phone call about how and where my item could be mailed to me. Well that phone call NEVER came. I called back the hotel later that evening and was told that I had to call back in the morning. When I called in the morning I spoke with a manager named Michael and informed him how important this item was to me. He assured me that he would look into my lost item with housekeeping and the current guest in the room and get back to me. HE NEVER DID. Over the next few days I spoke with several employees and still no one was able to help me. Now I have worked at a Mariot and know that check in time is 30 pm. If I called at 130 pm when no one was in the room why could not someone just retrieve my item. I also know that if housekeeping finds something they are required to turn it in. So since my item was very easily seen in the front room where is it Springhil. I called the hotel aprox. eight times from Friday to Monday and left several messages for the Manager Michael. I was informed that two different guests had checked in and out of the same hotel room since Friday making it impossible to locate my missing item. I was very upset and frustrated because if my request and problem was addressed properly from my first call I know that my item would have been recovered. This is not the service or run around that I expect from any Mariot. Thanks Springhil Suites. To date Michael has still not called me back. I have now contacted corporate and was given a case number.", "offset": [283, 356], "date": "2019-05-29", "cpt": "1", "category": "parking"}, {"id": 13, "uid": "06634a28-fd39-47d0-a4ef-286de799f534", "sentence": "Poorly Maintained. There was construction at the main entrance to the hotel which was distracting and disruptive. It did not allow for a pleasant environment during the stay. This also affected the parking requiring longer walks transit through a busy parking lot with small children.
