Arriving very late it had a few snack choices sorbets and beverages. In the morning there was a typical continental breakfast with boiled eggs pastries breads cereals etc. Pretty much what Mariot promises elites. You can take it back to your suite or down to the atrium tables. The gym is quite nice with a range of pulley machines dumb bells aerobic equipment and enough room to do a body weight workout. This gym is much better than typical. Overall I had a great stay and would return. The architecture is similar to a lot of the atrium style Embassy Suites locations.

Hm where should I begin. Lets start by saying that the over night check in guy is a bit awkward. It took him over 30 minutes just to check me in. Finaly after giving me my key I went to my room. Before I did I stopped at the pantry on the 7th floor and it was trashed. Crumbs all over the place not to mention mms all over and empty bottles of soda and water. When I did make it to my room it I turned on My light only to see my bed not made but the bathroom toilet had a floater in it. I did not bother calling down to the lobby as I was sure they did not have any over nite pl. So I slept in my chair. I was awoken by the sound if the highway traffic in the early am. So I took a shower grabbed my bag and went back down to the pantry. Well that was well worth it. Not. There was a girl in there who was taking selfies of herself with who I think was one of the cooks there. When I asked a question they both looked at one another and spoke something Spanish and giggled. So I opted out of there and headed downstairs to the bar restaurant. Waited 10mins just to get a coffee and menu. Well the food just was not edible. Potatos were soggy and eggs were over cooked. No time to complain because by now I needed to get to my conference. When I got back from my meeting I was bummed to see the bar not open it was 2 pm. So I went back to the pantry to get an water or 2 only to have some big guy in a black coat and jeans tell me I was only to take one water at a time. So I put back the one water and grabbed a couple of cookies again the guy said that could only take one. Really. Really. I dropped both cookies and left the water went to my room. Grabbed the rest of my stuff left my room and headed to the elevator only to see the same guy in the jacket and jeans with 2 cookies in his hand eating one and drinking a bottle of Gatorade when I said what made him so special he could have more then 1 cookie he said he was the head chef. Never in my life I was sohapy to check out. I ended up leaving and not saying a word to anybody at the desk. I just had to leave. The next few days I was in town I ended up staying at the Hilton up the road. I even told my bosses that we shouldseriously not send our staff to the.
