We were lucky enough to get a free room from the Horseshoe while in town to see Alice in Chains. We arrived right at rush hour on a Thursday afternoon so we called ahead to see if the valet was available. We had just enough room to park in front of the property and unload our stuff. The valet staff and the check in process was smooth everyone was courteous and we were in our room in less than 10 minutes. The queen room was very nice and clean the bathroom and shower were spacious and despite having a room overlooking the atrium the noise level was not bad at all. We asked many questions about the property transportation and sampled the bar and restaurant. We ordered a steak from the bar just before close and it was very good much larger than the advertised size. We enjoyed chatting with the bartender Boz who gave us a little history about downtown. The wine list was good and there are plenty of spirits available for all budgets. In the morning we had breakfast and coffee on a Friday around 1030am. We were the only ones there and it did not seem like the staff was ready. The food was very good and the service was ok they forgot an order of potatoes and took awhile on the coffee. Overall we were very happy with our stay and spent what we would have on our room on a bottle of wine and two meals. One odd thing is that a staff member was complaining about scheduling to another staff member at the Palace while were eating our meal. We felt that this lacked class.

At about midnight we needed a screwdriver for my sons Thomas train toy and we went to the desk and they were very helpful and found us one. The room was gorgeous. Very different than modern hotels. Had a very nice old time feel which we loved. The bathroom was unreal. Heated floors. Which we have never felt or even knew existed. So amazing to walk in there barefoot and to warm right up. The jacuzi tub was amazing and had lights that changed colors which was just so cool. And the shower. HUGE. And rain shower I think it is called with the shower heads on the ceiling. just amazing.
