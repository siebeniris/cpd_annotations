This Four Seasons is probably not one of the most charming of the chain. Starts with the attitude of the front desk which is far from the normal ultra friendly customer oriented attention that characterizes Four Seasons. In this one we found staff doing you a favor as a client rather than understanding who pays their salary. The rooms that face the bay are facing the construction of the street and of the building in front of it so there is a lot of noise and traffic. Not the hotels fault but it adds to the disappointment. In general this hotel can be classified as a business hotel but not as a luxury one. The breakfast was the highlight of the experience. It was well catered had many options and the request for prepared food were served promptly. Also the concierge did an excellent job recommending and finding a reservation at Aria restaurant.
