We booked the Rouge Suite for my sisters bachelorette party over the weekend because we wanted a nice room for the girls to get ready together in and then for a couple of us to sleep in after dancing in DC. My sister is getting married at another Kimpton hotel so I wanted to keep it in the Kimpton family. I could not be happier that we chose Rouge they provided a perfect experience for my sister and our guests. From start to finish everything was flawless. I mentioned on the reservation our reason for being there and while I was checking in they congratulated my sister and mentioned to me that there were some goodies in the room. We also were lucky enough to arrive during the wine hour so all the ladies were greeted with complimentary wine during check in. In the room they had left a complimentary bottle of champagne desserts fruit flowers and even a wedding magazine. The hotel managers even took the time to hand write a card for my sister. It really made her smile and kicked the evening off to a great start. The room was spacious and clean. The bathroom was impeccable and the staff made sure we had everything we needed. They delivered anything we called for promptly. All of our interactions were completely professional and they were very helpful with organizing taxis and making sure we got to our dinners and appointments on time. The wifi was fast you do need to sign up for the rewards program for free access but it is free so I recommend doing so before your stay. We did not get a chance to try the restaurant so I can not comment there. The location was perfect walking distance to DuPont Circle and lots of hot spots. All in all we had a great stay my sister loved it and I would definitely stay there again.", "offset": [37, 243], "date": "2015-04-20", "cpt": "0", "category": "room"}, {"id": 2, "uid": "d87b949b-714e-48ca-b002-8f14da9a0a23", "sentence": "Spacious rooms in a great location.

I loved my room which was directly across from the Aussie Embassy. Easy walking distance to the sights White House Smithsonian The Mall etc and convenient to Du Pont 14th St and good bars and nightlife. Not directly in the center of DC life but not far away.

However about an hour after we checked in someone used a keycard to walk into our room claiming that they had been checked into the same room by the staff downstairs. We were able to stop them from making it completely into the room which was fortunate because we were not in any state to have company at the time. When we reached the staff downstairs they informed us that it was not possible for someone else to have been assigned the room. Then the other couple made it to the lobby to complain. The staff realized their mistake and called to apologize and walked a reprogramed set of keys to the room. They also promised to grant us 100 IHG points. Two months later I am still waiting for those points despite three emails and three calls to the hotel manager.
