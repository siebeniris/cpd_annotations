Checked in at 010 but to sign up for their rewards for casino chips closes at 10 pm. Got up early the next day and spent the day in town and took in a show. Back to the hotel after 10 pm so still can not receive rewards. This is Las Vegas. What casino closes its membership registration at 10 pm. We also left a personal item in the room when we checked out. Went back a few hours later only to find that there was no trace of it. Leads to question the integrity of the hotel cleaning staff. Follow up with the hotel lost and found was bad. Did not feel they really took the time to locate the item. Its close to the tram.

We enjoy the hotel portion although the rooms are small they are super clean. My concern though is there is no top sheet just the duvet style quilt does it get cleaned after every visitor leaves. Today we had a new twist I really do not understand. Only one wash cloth was in the room with two people in the room tonight a maid happened to be doing a late cleaning and I asked for a wash cloth as only one had been left. she tells me that is all they leave one per room. please tell me this is not so cause she is doing as instructed. Also now they leave just one bottle of water for 2 people. Restaurants are decent but pricey Cafe service always questionable. If you are a slot player go to another casino these machines here are so tight it is frightning. table game limits too high and tables sit empty. Pool area is beautiful.
