If you have ever stayed in an Embassy Suites hotel you know that you can expect a comfortable room nice amenities free parking a hot breakfast cooked to order and a happy hour with free drinks for 2 hours every night. There are two self service laundries in the hotel in case you need to refresh your clothes during an extended trip. Internet is free only if you are an honors member but ask at the front desk for a temporary card. This hotel is a short 5 minute drive from the airport in an area filled with too many hotels and chain restaurants to mention. The breakfast is served in the central atrium which provides a nice white noise to fill the huge interior volume. You will see many families with children either going to or coming back from a theme park. We had surprisingly good food in the Kitty Hawk restaurant in the atrium which is conveniently open late if you are either jet lagged or had a late arriving flight. This is not a gourmet restaurant but they do a great job on the things they offer. One caution if you are getting gasoline in this area near the airport please be sure to double check the pump prices before you buy. There are two gas stations on the main highway which have little or no signage and outrageous prices. more than 2x higher than just a mile down the road.", "offset": [621, 734], "date": "2015-02-19", "cpt": "0", "category": "general"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "0df33225-540a-4321-95f2-28bd330749a8", "sentence": "Convenient to airport.

We were gone from that morning till the evening we got to the room was told everything was fixed. The room smelled real musty and the carpet was wet stil. They moved us again. We got to the other room everything was working well. Until the next morning when our keys would not work they fixed that and after that the trip was good. There were two people that worked there that had great customer service the guy that checked us in I do not know his name. There was also a woman there name Aby from New York.

Overall a really good experience in terms of the property and the super friendly and efficient team. However from an environmental perspective the hotel should look at some of its practices. It \u2019s all very well sticking up signs at breakfast to say your bagels are sourced locally when at the same time you are providing single use plastic bowls for your porridge oatmeal. The amount of plate waste from the buffet was shocking too. I did not check in until close to 8 pm but when I arrived in my room the ac unit was running. I am assuming that had been the case since it had been cleaned for arrival earlier that day. And the room did not even need it. First thing I did was switch it off. Such a terrible waste of energy. Rooms were spacious and clean and quiet. Staff were super helpful in the bar restaurant reception and house keeping. Refurb was not disruptive. Within 10 minute walk there is a mini complex with shopping dining and cinema if you have time to kill between checkout and flight times. Clarity around the airport shuttle times booking.

Room service and located really close to the airport as well as many food places. it is not right off a direct street so the quite was kind of nice too. Pool closes at 10 which I felt was early considering they did not have any inside and it is a vacation spot. Elevators were being worked on so that was a pain because the only one they had working was extremely slow and it might take you 25 minutes to get down we were only on the 4th floor also.
