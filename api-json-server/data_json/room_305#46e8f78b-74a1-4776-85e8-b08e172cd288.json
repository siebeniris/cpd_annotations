The kids had a great time on the ferry across to Pier 39 close to Fishermans Wharf and Alcatraz Pier. Plenty of varied eating in Jack London nice restruants but as a family we chose Plank which is like a beer garden and had great service and food. The hotel room Very nice place to stay and we appreciated the extra room family of 4. We were given a disabled suite which had 2 tvs and a seperate lounge area. fabulous as we have been travelling for 4 weeks. The service was friendly room was quiet clean and well appointed. Valet Parking. This was my negative. For two nights we paid more than 500 and then got slugged an extra 50 for parking. When I booked there was no mention of valet parking. it was parking available. Not happy about this especially considering our car was moved 20 metres and there it stayed until we checked out. Sorry but this left a bad taste in what was supposed to be the highlight acomodation of our trip. We did not encounter this even in Las Vegas at the Hilton free undercover parking.

The hotel staff was very pleasant and the room was very spacious. Its located in the heart of Jack London Square so there are plenty of restaurant choices and places to walk. BUT it is right where the train stops. We heard the train and the whistle blowing every 20 minutes or thereabouts up until 10pm then started up again at around 50 AM. The earplugs they supply for you does not block out the noise of the train nor the loud humming noise in the room 247. There was also the very loud noise coming from the air unit on top of all the other noises such as other guests were having some sort of party and there was pounding and loud tvs. Bottom line did not get a whole lot of sleep. For the price we paid I also expected a better view at least not one that overlooks the parking lot. There was not a mini refrigerator or microwave in our room even though they say they are standard in every room. I still rate it an overall 3 star because of the staff cleanliness spaciousness and location. location Jack London Square has many restaurants game room with bowling the ferry is right there that can take you directly to a Giants game or to the city.", "offset": [1030, 1186], "date": "2016-04-27", "cpt": "0", "category": "room"}, {"id": 2, "uid": "cfe02b9e-3e16-48af-b852-e3bf5f636140", "sentence": "Excellent Customer Service.

It was something I wanted to visit for many years had to wait till I retired. The Waterfront Hotel is a seafaring themed hotel hesitate to say nautical themed. Each room or suite is quite large as large as a medium sized studio. I opted for the sea view which encompasses not only Jack London Square it \u2019s located in the middle of it just a few feet from the sculpture of the famous author but the ocean Alameda distant San Francisco. On Friday early evening to the weekends the sea view allows you to take in the three day festivities festooned with tents shops street food American Creole Soul dancers music the energy of people. The rooms are equipped with the standard fare but there is a nice dorm room sized refrigerator hidden in the cabinet beneath the large screen TV37 \u201d or larger. Next to it is your safe large enough for laptops other items. Below the safe is a 4dreser drawer ensemble. Two bottles of Kala Springs water is delivered daily. The bed is comfortable but I lounged watching TV on the large sofa as well.

I gave it 4stars only because 15blocks away a rail line shared by Amtrak Caltrain freight shares rumbles around.
