About 30 minutes north of Atlanta it is the perfect weekend getaway. The salmon at the Irish restaurant was delicious as was the breakfast buffet at the Versailles restaurant. We took a romantic stroll through a couple of their trails. They were picturesque well manicured and meandered through the woods streams golf course and mansions. On Friday night they had a DJ and free pool in the lounge. The king sized bed was large and comfortable. The glass shower and roomy tub made we want to have one in my own place. We visited the winery and brought home a bottle of their signature sweet wine. Highly recommended for a weekend getaway. The food was delicious. The trails were picturesque and serene. There was DJ and free pool on Friday night. We slept well in the comfortable bed. The resort is about 30 minutes north of Atlanta.

We absolutely loved our stay for three nights. We arrived on a Sunday and stayed til Wednesday so the resort was not crowded at all. In talking to staff members the resort gets really crowded beginning on Thursdays due to its proximity to Atlanta. We were given a huge beautiful corner room in the main building complete with sectional sofa reading chairs and a writing desk. Dressing area is completely separate from the large beautifully appointed bathroom. I am usually glad when I get home to sleep in our own bed. Not this time the bed was wonderful. Someone had mentioned no safe and no microwave we had a safe in our closet. And no microwave. Why on earth would I go to someplace like this and need a microwave. Our first night we ate at Paddys Irish pub. Casual restaurant friendly wait staff great beer selection and of course wine. I had the Bangers and Mash fabulous but with three sausages I could not eat it all. We had shared a large Bacon and Apple salad before the meal which was perfect. One whole day was spent at the Spa. my husband and I had the couples massage. The spa has everything you could want. We enjoyed the gazebo outdoors the lounge the steam bath and the saunas his and hers the whirlpool the lounge. We had lunch at Fleur de Lis at the Spa. We all literally everyone men and women dined in our robes. Do not miss the scallops. Perfectly seared. Our massage was incredible then we were able to just relax in the quiet room afterwards. On another day we loved the Wine Tour which was included in our 3night package Omar was our very informative and helpful guide. From Peru he speaks 5 languages. He loves his job at Chateau Elan and it shows. Dinner at Cafe Elan is a must. Our waitress Joana was very knowledgable about the selections and helped guide our choices. She was very attentive yet never hovered. She was precious. Dinner was a nice long event no rushing. We appreciated that on our anniversary. She surprised us with a a platter with Happy 25th Anniversary written in chocolate complete with strawberries. The manager printed a menu for us with the same well wishes at the top. The LAuberge Lounge is a large bar with pool tables that my husband enjoyed. A classy bar mind you. Chateau Elan was a perfect choice for us to relax and enjoy our anniversary. I forgot about the pool. big beautiful wonderful chaise lounges big umbrellas to stay out of the sun great pool bar cafe.", "offset": [1140, 1250], "date": "2015-06-21", "cpt": "0", "category": "general"}, {"id": 2, "uid": "297ac2fd-2202-4d59-b18c-eede283b32c5", "sentence": "Amazing.

The grounds are georgeous and a walk or bicycle ride is highly suggested to see all of the beauty beyond the inn facility. We enjoyed all 5 restaurants on site. The fish chips at Paddys is the best we have ever had. The burgers at the pool side grill are a must. The rooms are spacious and the large garden tub was a nice touch. The whole facility is beautifully decorated and extremely clean. The Spa was a wonderful experience of pampering and relaxation. We thoroughly enjoyed the winery tour. The guide and wine stewarts were very informative and the tour was educational. Every moment spent at the chateau was a wonderful experience.

They offer turn down service and come to your room but do not actually do turn down. They leave the dirty towels on the bathroom floor leave your garbage and pull your sheet down. They bring chocolate sometimes and sometimes not. On one evening three people came to do turn down and the results were as stated above. When I complained to a manager he said he should teach his staff better. When I asked for dinner recommendations from guest relations the person said she did not know of any places in the area and did not even recommend the restaurants in the hotel.

We enjoyed our time during the day and evening on the property however our sleeping environment and follow up customer service was terrible. My husband and I were awakened by some nearby neighbors having a very loud argumentative conversation. My husband and I are both heavy sleepers so the fact that we both woke up to this tells you something. The argument contained terribly foul language and obscenities and was very loud through seemingly paper thin walls. This began around 215 am and lasted through the 40 hour. My husband called the front desk twice within the two hours and security came to knock on their door both times. However soon after security knocked on the door the fussing continued. For the amount of money we paid I expected a relaxing night at Chateau Elan. Instead it turned into a sleepless night of cringing at an uncomfortable conversation. While I know the couple \u2019s conversation is not representative of Chateau Elan the way this situation was handled was not good enough for us or the other guests who had to share walls with this unhappy couple. In addition to this situation I had like to share that the customer service following this event is completely unacceptable. After being asked to share our thoughts via email about the quality of our stay I responded and received no response. I forwarded the email to another manager and still received no response.
