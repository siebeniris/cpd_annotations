Fabulous Staff. We stayed a week in an ocean front cottage room and loved EVERY minute of it. I have read a few of the recent very detailed reviews and many of them are helpful while some of them are just too damn picky. This is a resort on a small island with beautiful surroundings incredible manicured grounds a fantastic beach and the most incredible spa location I have seen in the world and I have seen quite a few. This is a five star resort in a remote location so it is going to be expensive. If you are going to nitpick over the cost of a breakfast brunch just do not go. The people that work here are just fabulous and genuinely try their best to make sure you enjoy yourself. The location is superb so relaxing and feels like a private community with park like grounds. The grounds are manicured and kept quite immaculate. There are trade winds in the BVIs and as a consequence some things blow around a bit. We loved the grounds we felt absolutely safe all of the time note that you can lock your room when you are in it as some reviews have noted that you do not lock the doors actually there is no need to during the day as the grounds are secure and patrolled by security day and night. It feels pretty much like a large private park with the buildings all well spaced out and lots of greenery everywhere. The beach is excellent. It is not a huge wide beach like South Beach in Miami. It is a very nice and pleasant private beach. There are chairs and cabanas located throughout the property. Even with a lot of people there it felt so uncrowded. If you are adventurous the resort boat will take you to a deserted beach elsewhere on the island. The room was just excellent. The bed was fantastic and everything in the room is in neutral earth tones to fit in with the surroundings so relaxing. I never heard a tv there are not any in the rooms or a cell phone so niceThe spa is just fantastic. Get a couples massage and ask them to open the door and turn off the AC. The surf pounds on the beach below the spa and it is so relaxing. The spa attendants were excellent. The food was just wonderful. It was not perfect but everyone tried their best to make it that way. We were asked our opinion of the food and the service on each occasion that we sat down for dinner. We enjoyed it immensely and found the menu variety wonderful. The servers are very professional yet a lot of fun. Great peopleFor nearby dining we highly recommend Coco Maya absolutely superb food. A nice blend of Asian largely Japanese influence with latin. Their location is also unbelievable. The service throughout was just superb. Every person we came in contact with was extremely pleasant. This is one of those resorts where all the staff say hi to you and come to know your name very quickly in a genuine sort of way not phony. There were people of all ages at the resort but we never heard an unruly child and there were quite a few kids thereThe resort shuttle boat is amazingly smooth in the water. It is a catamaran that cuts through the waves and chop like nothing I have seen before. We flew direct to Virgin Gorda from San Juan but tok the resort shuttle to Tortola when we were departing very convenient. We loved it and will definitely go back. This was our first visit. This is one of those resorts that leaves you with a good feeling as it was just a superb visit and everyone there tried very hard and were very friendly.", "offset": [948, 1229], "date": "2015-03-12 00:00:00", "cpt": "0", "category": "room"}, {"id": 4, "uid": "f1481edb-4283-41c3-9ae5-c45fb9a1e4e7", "sentence": "Laid back Island Paradise. This is the 2nd trip for my wife and myself to Little Dix Bay LDB. We convinced some relatives to visit LDB several years ago. They liked it so much that they arranged for a larger group to make the journey this year 2015. We were a party of 17 in 7 different rooms along the beachfront. Our travel agent the New York City sales staff and the local management made it a memorable visit. LDB remains the most relaxing vacation spot we have ever visited. When we sit at home and say We need a vacation we need to get away we automatically think of LDB on Virgin Gorda. It has its own long sandy beach in a protected cove. There is a long coral reef not far from shore. We saw a dozen or more sea turtles when we kayaked paddle boarded sailed lounged on rafts snorkeled and swam in front of the hotel. The highlight was seeing an octopus. There is a relaxing well staffed spa with an infinity pool and gorgeous views at one end of the property. There are tennis courts and a fitness center. There are 3 restaurants on property. Spanish Town is not far away bars restaurants and a grocery store. You can fly directly to Virgin Gorda eg via Cape Air flights or fly into Beef Island Tortola and take a boat ride to the boat dock on property. You can arrange for free drop offs at nearby beaches with a beach umbrella and optional lunch. You can arrange for a fee fishing trips sunset cruises and trips to nearby British and US Virgin Islands. The one thing that prevented me from giving an overall Excellent rating for LDB was the restaurants. When we first arrived the only place open for lunch was the Beach Grill. If you arrived in the middle of lunchtime you could expect to wait at least an hour to be served your food. Our group had a 2hour lunch one day. The Property Manager recognized this problem and opened the Sugar Mill restaurant for lunch to alleviate the wait. However the Beach Grill just does not have the infrastructure to serve everyone in a timely manner for lunch. The wait staff remains calm cheerful and helpful but they are in a not so good situation. A few times the fish was overcooked at the Sugar Mill Restaurant and Pavilion Dining Room the other restaurants on property. Generally the food was very good. There was a good variety on the menu and especially at the buffets. You could order a bottle of wine at dinner good selection not as expensive as I would have thought. If you did n\u2019t finish the bottle the staff would save it for you for another dinner meal. The breakfast buffet at the Pavilion Dining Room had an extensive selection. You could get an omelet made to order along with pancakes and French toast. There was a table with local foods that I visited every morning. One of the staff made fruit smoothies to order. My wife and I splurged and got the Couples Retreat treatment at the Sense Spa. It was a very very sensual experience applying a special mud treatment to your partners body get a couples massage in a room with a view and relaxing afterwards on a private patio with fruit and water a shower and hot tub. Be sure to come early and relax in the infinity pool 2 levels that overlooks Drakes Passage or the outdoor hot tub. You can climb the hill at the spa pass by the large platform for yoga and descend a short distance to a lookout point with 2 chairs. it is the perfect place to go in late afternoon with a bottle of champagne and see the boats go back and forth between the nearby islands and then watch the sunset. Very romanticWe had a ground floor ocean cottage room. The beach was 40 50 feet out the back door. We had a table chairs and lounge chairs just outside the room. The room was spacious with a large walk in closet. The bathroom was spacious as well with double sinks a shower and a tub. The bed was comfortable. There is an overhead fan. The room was serviced twice a day. Wherever you walked on the property you were greeted with a smile and friendly hello by the hotel staff. You could call and arrange for a golf cart to pick you up outside your room and take you to the dining area or to the spa. You can even arrange to be taken to the edge of the property and walk 5 10 minutes to get to Spanish Town. Once a week LDB held a BQ picnic celebration at nearby Spring Bay. The winner or their parents of the limbo contest won a bottle of champagne at the picnic. There is a weekly managers reception with hors doeuvres and drinks at the swimming pool area it is a chance to mingle with fellow guests and hotel staff. There are other organized activities such as hikes and snorkel tours. For some variety consider going into Spanish Town for dinner one night. There are several nice restaurants some right on the beach. The taxi fare is 4 US per person each way. You can be as busy or as relaxed as you want at LDB. There are lots of options. The sun is warm. The water is inviting. you are on island time. Enjoy and relish the memories because you \u2019l want to come back.", "offset": [2860, 3082], "date": "2015-04-12 00:00:00", "cpt": "0", "category": "room"}, {"id": 5, "uid": "93929375-af12-4d74-9673-d1945b5e57c3", "sentence": "Trip of a Lifetime. We visited Rosewood at Little Dix Bay during the last week of June 2015 celebrating our 20 year anniversary. In short it was the best vacation either of us have ever had and we have been a lot of places. For the last year leading up to our anniversary my wife and I had been mulling over options of where we had like to spend our 20th. We knew we wanted tropical white sand blue water etc. we have been to Hawaii which is easy for us to get to from CA but did not want to do that again. I had been around Virgin Gorda as a kid when my dad chartered a sailboat and we sailed the Virgin Islands for a week back in the 80s. I remembered a place with giant boulders leading into the ocean The Baths and thought that might be a fun place to go. A little research and soon we booked seven nights at the Rosewood hotel at Little Dix Bay. Doing my research I heard the following comments regularly about Rosewood. Staff was incredible absolutely true. Everyone bends over backwards to help be friendly say hi etc. did not have one bad experience with service the entire trip. Quiet and peaceful absolutely true. We would often times walk from our cottage 121 awesome by the way over to breakfast and not see another person until we arrived at the restaurant. Beach was tranquil absolutely true. We are accustomed to going on vacation and having to wake up at the crack of dawn to get a couple of lounge chairs. Not here. In fact we joked more than a few times that our most stressful decision of the day was which of the 40 or so lounges we should choose on any given morning. Talk about first world problemsThe resort and actually the whole island is very quiet. So if nightlife is what you are after you will want to pick a different island. We were looking for quiet and relaxing and Rosewood was perfect for that. They did have some kind of music at the main restaurant most evenings which was just enough entertainment for us. We ended up doing just about everything we wanted to. I had gotten my scuba certification the week prior to our visit and ended up doing three dives. Absolutely awesome. Not only was the scenery incredible highly recommend diving the HMS Rhone a 300 foot steamship that sunk in a hurricane in 1867 but the staff at BVI which is on property were awesome. True professionals. While I was diving my wife went to the spa on property and had some treatments massages. She loved it. They have a great infinity pool and she spent the afternoons reading and looking out over the bay. Not sure which of us had a better timeWe also rented a jeep one day and covered the island. Went to The Baths an absolutely MUST. Recommend going early even before it opens around 8 am I think to beat the crowds. Do NOT go on Wednesday. That is cruise ship day and they end up shuttling 100s over to the island to visit the Baths. Continued the drive to the abandoned copper mine. Interesting but no more than 15 minutes worth. We then drove to the other side of the island and ended up eating at Hog Heaven. Another must. Great view cool breeze friendly folks working there and some of the best pork ribs I have ever had the owner has his own farm that supplies them. Plus a heck of a lot cheaper than at the resort but I will get to that. Drove back on the other side of the island back to Spanish Town and had a beer down at Yacht Harbor. Spanish Town sounds more interesting than it was. Very sparse a couple of restaurants only a few of which I would consider eating at. Not really a place you want to spend any time in. On to food. We ate at three different restaurants off property while on the island. Already mentioned Hog Heaven so I will skip that one went back for dinner by the way it was that good. Trehouse a restaurant literally nestled among the treetops. Felt like Robinson Crusoe eating on a deck with the most incredible view. We got there at 6 pm and were the only ones up there for maybe 45 minutes. Was truly amazing. Food was very good but the view is worth the trip alone. Next restaurant was Coco Maya. Amazing. Right on the beach great ambiance and really great food. More of a tapas type of restaurant with smaller plates they had some entrees too but small plates seemed like the way to go. Wonderful food and actually relatively inexpensive. Based on all the great reviews I was prepared to pay a lot but it actually was pretty reasonable. We went there last night but wish we would have gone earlier as we surely would have gone back a second time. Now on to eating on property at the Rosewood. If I look back on the vacation this might be the only thing I would rate as anything less than excellent. Everything is SO expensive. In most cases the quality was very good to excellent and at a resort like this I expect to pay a bit for good dining but I guess I did not think it would be as high as it was. They have three restaurants and we ate at each of them. Had breakfast each morning and a couple of dinners at the Pavilion which is their main restaurant. Breakfast was great each morning staff was very cheery and attentive. They had a station where you could get eggs to order or fresh pancakes or waffles. Also had a huge spread of fresh fruit very high quality. Also had a smoothy station which was great. For that however you pay 35 per person plus 18 service charge which is added to all food and drinks. We were fortunate to have booked with a travel agency that was part of a network where they got certain benefits at Rosewood and so our breakfast was free. That was a very nice perk. Dinners at Pavilion were very good but not out of this world great. They had a few nights with buffets but we always ended up ordering off the menu. On the Saturday night we were there they were having Lobsterfest which was a lobster themed buffet. I think it was 95 per person but I figured for lobster that was not too off the charts. Then I saw the menu and noticed that it was a lot of different items that incorporated lobster but you were not getting lobster tails. For that you had to pay 145 per person. Thanks but no thanks we ordered off the menu. That particular dinner I was somewhat disappointed with. I ordered the surf and turf for around 58 a lot cheaper than Lobsterfest. The half lobster tail was good maybe a tad overcooked. The steak was not great reminded me of something you had get at Sizler for those not familiar with Sizler it is not good. That was my only so so experience with food quality. Ordered lunch a few times on the beach and that came from the Beach Grill which is down by the pier. Had a couple of salads which were also very good and had the benefit of being served to you by one of the staff that walks up and down the beach asking if you needed anything. About 18 23 per salad I think. We then ate at the Sugar Mill on our anniversary. Had a wonderful dinner and here you eat right down near the beach. Very romantic and we had a table right next to the beach and lighted trees that grew in front of the restaurant. Great service highly attentive and just a great experience overall. With a bottle of wine think we finished at close to 300. But it was our anniversary and we were very satisfied with the experience. What else. Snorkeling in the bay was fun although it gets a little dicey when the tide is low as the reef becomes so shallow you can not really snorkel over it and you end up trying to carve a path around it so you do not accidentally beach yourself on the corral reef ouch. On the last day my wife and I were snorkeling and saw a couple of rays and then saw a large turtle swim right towards and them past us. My wife is a huge turtle fan and we were hoping we would see one up close. While laying on the beach you will often times see their fins pop up out of the water as they eat the sea grass. Highly recommend the beach drops too. We did two. The first was awesome to an island called Great Dog. Had an entire beach to ourselves with only the occasional passing boat in the distance. They packed us lunch and we just laid there enjoying the peace and quiet occasionally diving. Second drop was to Long Bay. Nice also but there were a few boats anchored there so not as private. Still a great time. Played some croquet on their course that was fun. They have a great gym and tennis courts we did not use either. Had the best of intentions but something about laying around on a quiet beach seemed to be the better decision most days. Went on their evening cocktail cruise once which was a lot of fun. 65 per person for about a two hour cruise down to a place called Saba Island on the other side of the island. All you can drink and eat small appetizers plus a twenty minute or so stop on Saba Island to walk around drink more if you want before the return back. The catamaran they take you on is designed to break the choppiness of the ocean so it does not rock at all. My wife can get pretty seasick and she was fine the entire cruise. Good chance to talk with some of the other quests you are all pretty close on the boat and great view of the island and sunset. All in all a wonderful trip and highly recommend.", "offset": [641, 759], "date": "2015-07-07 00:00:00", "cpt": "0", "category": "room"}, {"id": 6, "uid": "3de26aa4-0bad-4eef-abd3-ec8461a18e00", "sentence": "BVI Paradise. We traveled to Virgin Gorda not knowing anything about it other than everyone we knew who had been there loved it. So after figuring out how to get there a direct flight from DFW to San Juan and then a Cape Air puddle jumper to Virgin Gorda our trip was booked. Our first impression of Little Dix Bay was before we even arrived at Virgin Gorda our flight from San Juan to Virgin Gorda was canceled so were being rerouted to Tortola where we would then take a ferry to Virgin Gorda. I called Little Dix Bay to inform them of the itinerary changes and they were very accommodating arranging the transfer to the ferry as well as the ferry which delivered us directly to the resort. We were met with their signature rum punch which was amazing and then driven to our hill top villa. The villa was beautiful. Spacious with fabulous views out every window. The property was perfection. The daily breakfast buffet offered something for everyone and we had everyone in our group. from carnivores to vegans. The extensive beach was beautiful offering groupings of four lounge chairs an ocean chair and two pool floats per each umbrella. The beach waiters came by periodically offering refreshing frozen grapes ice water and Evian face spritzes. There were also numerous kayaks catamarans paddle boards etc. available to use as well.

Staff very nice. I got scraped up at the Baths and the guy at the activity center was nice enough to administer some first aid. He just volunteered. The guests and the staff everyone was very friendly. Actually the friendliest place I have ever been. Guess everyone is happy. Gym very nice as are the tennis courts. Food was good to excellent. Room service was a nice perk with the meal plan. It was very nice to be able to relax in our own room and eat breakfast. A lot of guests were repeats. Can see why. We were there a week and still not sure we did everything. We did dive with Dive BVI. It was great too. Super people. We flew in with Fly BVI. Our pilot was awesome. He helped us with our forms and bags. Very polite and helpful. The views and the plane ride on the Piper Aztec were incredible.

We just returned from Little Dix and I started not to do a review as the property as previously stated by other reviewers. is about to close for a year for renovations but thought I would throw in a quick review. First the property grounds and beach are lovely. One of my favorite things is the way the rooms suites are spaced so that everything feels private. I hate feeling like everyone is on top of each other. The beach and grounds are laid out so that there is a feeling of space and privacy. The beach is so restful and beautiful and long so that you can get in a nice walk. The property is just 5 minutes from the small airport so it is easy logistics which is also nice. The flowers and grounds are well tended. The service was very good and the people were so very friendly. I almost felt like I was at camp because of the family feel you get from the employees. We were in a junior suite which was very spacious and beautiful. Although I guess that does not matter since they are about to renovate. It really looked almost new though. Very clean. I also appreciated the thorough servicing of the room in the morning and at turn down. They really provide excellent service. My only negative is that we were downstairs 2 stories. and we could hear every footstep and chair scrape from the occupants above. We were awakened nightly and every morning by our neighbors above. I hope that in the new construction the rooms are more soundproof. So we did not have a restful experience as far as trying to sleep. If booking I would advise you to make sure you are on the top floor. We were very appreciative of the car driver for 15 minute trips provided complimentary. That was a nice touch.

I sent an email upon our return home and inasmuch as I have not received a response I have decided to post here. The email began Please forward this to Mr Pade and Mr Arora in the event I have incorrect emails. Dear Mr Pade I am writing to make you aware of our experience at Rosewood Little Dix Bay. I chose to contact you directly rather than placing a review on Trip Advisor. We chose to visit Virgin Gorda not only for the beauty of the island but the exclusivity of Rosewood Little Dix Bay. The description on Google was \u201c high end beachfront lodging offering 3 restaurants an infinity pool plus a posh spa and a gym \u201d. According to your website there was a promise of \u201c dedicated butler service \u201d which was enticing as well. Although the hotel is quite beautiful the lack of service we experienced impacted our stay. We were spending 4 days with our very close friends the Bienstocks and were looking forward to relaxing and being pampered as we all have stressful lifestyles. In the interest of time I will list those items we found extremely disapointing1. There were 2 restaurants not 3. The farm to table restaurant is not ready. We ate at the Sugar Mill on Wednesday night our first night there. The service was beyond terrible. Anything we asked for from water to bread to cocktails never arrived until one of our friends got angry. At that point Marcus stepped in and tried to make everything right. He should be commended for his skills as well as his long hours and eforts2. We arranged with our butler to have housekeeping to arrive at 9. I realized the first day that I should change it to 12 noon so we would be out of the room and showered for the day ahead. Although I made the request the housekeeper came between 9 and 10 am. It was inconvenient to have them there when I was trying to shower after working out at the gym. We also realized that our butler is not \u201c dedicated \u201d to us. She has 14 other rooms to assist which it made it very difficult to get the attention we were expecting. 3. My husband and I wanted to purchase a bathing suit and a sweater from the shop. The women although very nice were unfamiliar with the process and it took at least 20 minutes before we could leave with our items4. The pools are tiny and the spas are not fully staffed. My husband wanted a massage either Thursday or Friday but there was no availability. 5. We ordered lunch on the beach. After an hour and a half we were informed that there was a problem in the kitchen. At that point the rain started and we went back to our room. Although we canceled the order we were charged anyway. There are attendants walking the beach but my husband had to move his own chaise and the towels were pretty much thrown on the edge of the chair instead of being properly set up. I would appreciate a response. Thank you in advance. I did not receive any response.", "offset": [1782, 1878], "date": "2020-02-28 00:00:00", "cpt": "1", "category": "room"}, {"id": 18, "uid": "c0adf03c-b2da-40b1-9beb-3e61e97a0c2c", "sentence": "We had great expectations. Had never been to the BVI and obviously not the fabled LDBRosewod has done a great job with rebuilding after the storm. it is next to impossible to replace what a major hurricane destroys. The overall property looks great and the room was wonderful though there a couple of small things that could be tweaked to make the stay a bit better. The disappointing part. The staff overall was great hardworking well meaning and friendly. There were two notable exceptions. First the butler who was assigned to our room was simply missing in action. On the day of our arrival we were greeted by the butler. She escorted us to our room and asked about dinner. We said 7 pm at the Pavilion and she said she had make the reservation and come by about ten until 7 to walk us over. She never showed up so finally at ten after 7 we walked over to the Pavilion by ourselves. And there was no reservation. The next day she again asked about dinner reservations and we said 8 at the Reef House. We arrived at 8 and there was no reservation. They were able to fit us in so it was not a significant issue. And from that point on we started going directly to the front desk to make reservations and the only problem we had there was on our last night we requested dinner at 8 at the Reef House and when we showed up there was no reservation not the butlers fault. We had also asked the butler about arranging a car rental for Tuesday. We went to the front desk area at the time we agreed on 11 am and the butler was finishing up with someone while we waited. She then excused herself to check on the car and became clear after about a half an hour that she had dropped the ball again but was able to arrange for the car. On the afternoon of our last day we returned to the room after being at the beach and found a bucket of ice on the table. We had not ordered it. My wife ordered some room service and when it was delivered she asked the woman about the ice. She said that the butler was supposed to be providing it everyday. When my wife told her this was the first time we had received any ice the woman said something along the lines of somebodys been slacking. So our overall experience with the butler service was not great. The second disappointment was with the dining service. And we both basically agreed that the servers had simply not been trained properly. We do not know if that is because there was a rush to open the resort and there just was not time or if this is as good as it gets in the BVI. Hopefully the former. One quick example. The wine service was sloppy. The the server finished pouring a glass he she just pulled the glass away dribbling along the way. And because the tables are mostly wooden slats there were several occasions when the wine dripped through and onto our feet fortunately never hitting our clothes. As I said the staff seemed well meaning but they just did not seem to know what to do. I do want to add that our housekeeper was great and the young man Devon. who served us on the beach was also wonderful. And the spa was also a great experience. Beyond the staff issues the food service itself left us unimpressed. There were a few good dishes but by and large the food was just not what we expected. One example was the eggs Benedict. I had it three times and it was consistent. The muffin was so over toasted that it took a fair amount of pressure to cut through it. The bacon was paper thin. The egg whites were typically translucent not cooked enough. And the hollandaise not a sauce but more like a dollop of sour cream glopy. And this is just one example. So is this a training issue or is there just a skilled labor problem that is part of life in Virgin Gorda and throughout the BVIWe also felt like the menu offerings were a bit strange trying too hard to do something different but then falling short on execution. And the wine list particularly by the glass across all three restaurants was too limited. No opportunity for each restaurant to express itself. I assume the resort has a sommelier that could work with each location to create separate wine lists or at least have a couple of unique offerings per location. The beach food service could probably be expanded a bit more finger foods. And the distance from kitchen to the customer makes it difficult to deliver fresh and not food. I do not know how you solve that problem other that to add another kitchen facility further down the beach or cut back on the foods eg French Fries. that require hot delivery. Just before we left for the trip I read some of the reviews on TripAdvisor and I told my wife I do not want to be one of those people. I think private feedback like this is more appropriate and is hopefully more helpful. We are looking forward to a return visit post CoronaVirus. in a couple of years and we hope that things will have stabilized with respect to some of these issues. Thanks for the opportunity to provide feedback and let me know if you need any more information.
