This hotel is in a central location though Union Square is a little gritty at night. During my stay two rooms on my floor were completely guted kanga hammers drills etc. from 8 am to 170 daily and the noise made the room unusable for 6 plus hours a day rather unfortunate given jet lag. Charging 200 a night for a room two doors away from what was essentially a building site is pretty poor business practice. No alternative rooms were available apparently. I may have been just unlucky but given the hotel is in need of some considerable updating I would check in advance that no works are planned for the duration of your stay. I was told nothing of these works when I checked in a basic note was slipped under the door long after the drilling and begun. Cons the gym which is admittedly better than average is an extra payment. Having paid 80 for my room the \u20ac 25 gym charge just seems petty and money grabbing.

Location. hotel Niko is on the edge of the rough area of SF the tenderloin. just Google this area and you will soon see. When Standing out the front of this hotel you will be sure to be approached by some people in question and upon checking in a staff member of the hotel advised me not to walk to the left side of the hotel. This was not good start. I think the area of such hotels like Hyat hotel is much better it seemed safer there. Interior the interior is old and definitely needs a renovation bedding is questionable when seeing under the sheets you will find old stained bedding.

Service the service of the staff is the only reason why this review gets what it gets staff are helpful and friendly particularly at breakfast.

I had stayed at Hotel Niko San Francisco due to the great reviews found on TripAdvisor. In my opinion this hotel is not worth the money. The hotel rooms are in need of updating and despite we had asked for our bedding to be changed there was still stains on the pillow cases. I am not sure if they were not changed or the new pillow cases just had stains on them that was not cleaned properly. The bathroom shower stand up shower stalls were also quite aged looking. Lastly we did not have access to the swimming pool or the fitness centres due to their 250 per day usage fee which seemed quite high as this is not Vegas. not sure why they charge per day for the use of their fitness centre pool. I would understand the fee if they had a state of the art fitness centre pool. Initially I was able to ignore these small imperfections. However it was at checking out that had left a bad taste in my mouth. I had made calls to my Visa card due to the fact that I had misplaced it in the hotel. Prior to my travels my credit card company had advised me to call a certain number on the back of the for collect free calls as they are accepting the charges for call. However I was charged roughly around 77 for the three calls that were suppose to be 10 each. I tried to explain this to the front desk agent Natalie however I am guessing that she can not executive decisions on her end so she brought out her manager Adrian who advised me that they can not do anything about it. I have no problem paying 13 for the all calls that I have made however the lack of customer service is what puts me off. Most high end hotel would at least offer to waive 1 2 calls or just 20 for as a customer service gesture. it is not about the money it is about the customer service. Adrian was not willing to do anything at all. She had an attitude like I had inconvenienced her by asking her to come out to talk about the charges. I could be the unruly hotel guests that makes a scene and yells but I rather be the person that tells my friends family and other travellers to stay away from this hotel and the next time I am in San Francisco. I will stay elsewhere that has proper customer service and clean pillow cases. Hotel Niko do not bother replying. I do not give second chances due to the fact that there are so many other hotel chains out there with proper customer service.", "offset": [169, 307], "date": "2016-07-08", "cpt": "0", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 8, "uid": "212428b2-c101-47e7-b02c-732c513d2aac", "sentence": "Ok nothing special.

I would highly recommend staying here. I have stayed in many hotels in my years but I have never ever stayed in a hotel where the staff were so lovely and attentive. The lady who checked us in was great she offered us an upgrade from a petite queen to a deluxe king because of our Expedia status high speed internet and the swimming pool were also free because of this too. Dany in the pool area was great he showed us round and took time to chat to us. The bell man was also very attentive always checking to see if we needed help or transport. All of the staff members were super friendly and polite great training. The room was lovely. A bay view room on the 19th floor. We could not see a huge amount of bay but at night it was clearer when you could see the tankers on the water. The view was wonderful half city view half bay view in my opinion. The king bed was medium soft I found it very comfortable with crisp bedding. Buster the dog stuffed toy was placed on the bed every day by housekeeping only for us to move him off again at night. He is available to buy for 29It is well known that the hotel recently closed for a total refurbishment. I believe the petite queen rooms were not refurbished at that time as they were quite new anyway. I have to say I do not believe the bathroom nor wardrobe were new in our deluxe king room as they were already showing slight signs of wear that should not appear after only 2 3 months of use. Both were satisfactory though. The only other slight negative for the room is that there are no drawers provided. There was a wardrobe with 11 hangers. We stayed for a week 2 people with 7 days clothes. Yes we did hang up a few items in the wardrobe but the rest of our clothes had to stay in the suitcases and it was awkward to find items each day. We used the pool almost every day it was quiet with a maximum of 4 people in one morning. They play relaxing piano music over the speakers. The pool is not massive and is shallow but adequate for a few laps. It was warm too. There is also a hot tub there. We loved the apples available in the gym and had one every day. We visited the cocktail bar one evening. The decor is pink and sparkles and the cocktail was delicious but a little pricey. Unfortunately there was a group of loud women in there at the same time and we could not hear our own conversation so we only stayed for one drink. Location wise it was amazing. Very close to Union Square and Powell Street Market Street areas just a tram trolley or bus ride away from everything else. It is noted by other reviewers that its close to the Tenderloin but I did not find it seedy or intimidating in anyway. There was the occasional person sleeping rough a few blocks away but I found that in all areas of the city that we visited.

Quiet rooms. Check in at the hotel was a breeze. Even though we arrived much ahead of legal check in time. Front desk agent upgraded our booked petite queen to a king. Within three minutes we were in our room. We loved it tremendously. It was a corner room with windows all around with lots of light and was spotles housekeeping was immaculate. We immediately booked another night for a deluxe king room. Later in a day we stopped by front desk to link our reservations. The trainee did not know how to do it and she asked for my ID and credit card. I was upset being current guest and being treated as a stranger who just walked in for the first time it just did not sit well with me. Obviously my ID is in a room. I did show my credit card to an agent. It seemed as it was a big task I asked for someone who knows how to process our request. Another person assisted us I assume it was a front office supervisor just guessing because there was no introduction. We were allowed to stay in the same room for another night. In the morning I wanted to use a coffee maker in the room Krueger but was utterly disappointed as the smell was unbearable the hotel uses rubber placements on a tray that presents Coffee maker coffee condiments and coffee mugs. Those plastic placements are made inexpensive meaning it is full of formaldehyde known carcinogen. Since it is gas every item on a tray was contaminated. The hotel as Niko should never ever use something that cause cancer. Needless to say that it reminds a jail prison type of presentation. The bathroom had a water leak it seemed as there was a pipe burst within a wall. The floor in the bathroom was covered with water even though bath and sink were dry. We stopped by front desk to address the issue with plumbing. During a day we called the hotel only to be informed that it was a shower head that caused the leak. We asked to investigate the matter further as it is incorrect and asked for manager to return our call. No one called us back. In the evening I returned to my room only to find it in disarray. No one cleaned it and floor in bathroom was flooded again. I went to see front desk about it. I was informed that there was indeed a leak and we have another room to relocate to. I was given keys to a new room and was asked to inform the front desk when I complete my move. Well the key to my present room got deactivated I had to return to front desk to activate the key. I packed and went to a new room keys were not activated for a new room. I was so exhausted that could not drag my luggage downstairs and stay in line again. I used hotels new feature and texted to the hotel hotline and asked assistance in getting into my room. It was at least 12 minutes till security showed up with new keys the only reason because housekeeper called again from floor on my behalf to assist meFinaly we got inside of new room just to find out that we were downgraded room was half smaller in size. I was so tired that I did not care but my partner was livid he went downstairs to see a manager. Shorty after we were escorted to a junior suite which was spacious and absolutely breathtaking. The remainder of stay was uneventful. But still no one called and no one cared if we were comfortable with our stay even upon check out the front desk agent never acknowledged our problem we had you would think there would be some comments on folio where it states that a guest had issues during a stay.
