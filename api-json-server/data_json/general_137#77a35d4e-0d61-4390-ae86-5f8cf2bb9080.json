Hardrock lives up to the brand with rock n roll decor memorbila and music Newly renovated it is for the most part very pretty contemporary and apleaing.

Could really use an all night diner place serving really good comfort food and 24 hr a day breakfast it is a casino after all. Skip the Hardrock Cafe the food is awful not just on one visit on four I give up. For a nice dinner Council Oak is expensive but good. For a quick really tasty and inexpensive meal stop at The Noodle Bar at Jubao Palace delicious. The rooms are nice but they need to invest in new beds soft beds all the rage these days and would be nice to climb into a really comfy bed after a hard day of gambling.

We stayed at the Hard Rock for one night and spent time in the casino and at the Hard Rock Cafe. The hotel room was not ready when we got there but we were checked in and our phone number was taken so they could ring once it was. It was supposed to be ready by 4 pm but was not ready till 430. This was no real hardship for us as we had left our overnight bag in the car and spent the time looking round the casino which is a maze. I was particularly impressed by their basic fraud prevention checking my credit card name against my ID and again checking ID on our return to the desk. I felt reassured by their attention to detail. I was also impressed that they had staff near the elevators ensuring that only guests that were actually staying at the hotel could use them. The room amenities were great. There is a safe in the room which is not advertised on their website for some strange reason there is free wifi and the usual TV options. There are USB charger outlets too for your devices should you require them. The bath was massive and shower luxurious with some lovely complimentary products. The king size bed was massive lovely and comfy with deliciously soft sheets. The other great thing was that the room was really quiet with very little noise from outside to disturb once we did get to bed. As it was a Sunday when we stayed the casino was busy but we managed to get served at the bar easily enough and the bar staff were friendly and attentive. All the staff greeted us cordially and I felt comfortable all round the casino. The casino provided us with some good entertainment and we were lucky enough to take some money home with us. Be warned that it is a smoking casino though with all the smell that goes along with it so be prepared to do laundry when you get home. There is a small area of the casino that is non smoking and that was very reasonable. The air conditioning works well so it is not completely fuggy but there is that residual smell that always seems to linger. We are not serious gamblers so I could not comment on how generous the payouts are but we had a good time. We also had breakfast in the bakery the following morning that was a reasonable price. However room service prices for a good range of breakfast items looked to be really good value and we wished we had taken advantage of that. Parking in the garage is free and convenient. All in all we had a great time and look forward to planning another one soon.
