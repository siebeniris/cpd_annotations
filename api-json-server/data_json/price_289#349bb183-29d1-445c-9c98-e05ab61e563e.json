If you like authenticity and British Royal History this hotel may be the one for you but for myself and my husband it was too authentic. We stayed 7 nights way too long a few people we spoke to were only staying one night which i think would be okay. At check in we discovered we had a 1495 I think. room payment a night. to go towards the restoration of the boat wi fi and a tour also entitled you to other tours half price our travel agent had not mentioned this at booking. If you stay here please be mindful of what you say as the walls are so paper thin we heard a morning conversation from the room the other side of our wall as well as sneezing coughing. Our room was a twin room which was not particularly big to upgrade to a room with a double was going to be an extra 30 a night. The rooms are in a time warp had I have known this when I booked my holiday. the original hotel we wanted was not available and I think this was the only other one in the travel agents brochure for Long Beach. I would have chosen a different resort to go to. it is just dated and a bit grubby. Flushing the toilet was so noisy that if we went in the night we did not dare flush it as you would scare your partner and the rest of the neighbouring cabins to death this then meant that the bathroom smelt awful in the morning. As ours was an inside cabin with no natural light you could never know if it was morning or still night as the room was pitch black. Visitors to the boat can take tours and these go down the corridors where your room may well be and obviously the tour guide is giving their talk to any number of people which can be noisy. A C noisy. We went out every day as there was not much to stay on the boat for. Buses run to and from the boat into Downtown Long Beach and to the Pier area and it is free you pick a return journey back to the boat from one of the stops and they are very regular which is good because the boat is a distance form the town over 10 in taxi fare. The beach is about a 15 minute walk away once you are down by the Shoreline Village Rainbow Harbor a lovely area of shops and restaurants on a pier. Highly recommend Tequila Jacks Mexican restaurant. We did have a meal on The Queen Mary which I have to say was very nice and price was actually comparable with other places we ate at. There is no swimming pool safety reasons on the Queen Mary which is something we like in a hotel as we often do beach in the morning and relax by a pool at the hotel in the afternoon. had I have known this this would have been another reason not to book. You can get into Hollywood from Long Beach using the Metrotrain for as little as 8 for a day pass takes over an hour but a cheap way to get there and well worth it. I think all in all had our travel agent given us more information when she suggested the Queen Mary we would definitely not have chosen it or Long Beach actually. Long Beach is quite quiet and we would have much preferred Santa Monica as a resort which we visited using the Metrotrain as it is busier resort and beach and there is the Pier and the end of route 66 but you live and learn and having never been to the area before you do not know these things until you get there. There are shops to buy gifts in on the boat. Staff we spoke to were friendly. Cabins were tidied daily if you want your bed linen changed you put a card on the bed so that they only get done when you want them to be done as obviously California has a drought. We did have an occasion where the shampoo was not replaced on the Thursday of our holiday my husband went to ask for one which they said they would bring in 10 minutes we are still waiting. It did not get replaced the following day and we were checking out on the Saturday. Like I previously said as a short stay would be okay but I would not recommend a longer stay. The shortcomings I have mentioned were not worth complaining about but they would deter me from staying here again.", "offset": [2242, 2375], "date": "2015-08-10", "cpt": "0", "category": "price"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "2000d6e5-a30b-4928-ad3f-2a7facf4900b", "sentence": "Worth a stay. We stayed with another couple as part of a road trip from SF to LAMy aunt had sailed on the Queen Mary in the 50s so it really appealed to me. We booked well in advance at a really good rate of about \u00a3 50 for an inside twin. On check in we were changed to a double which was quite bland. Perhaps we should have stuck with the twin. Our friends had booked an outside portholes double for a few pounds more and their room was so much better with lots of original fittings. I would recommend the valet parking as only a couple of dollars more. We ate in the restaurant as it was quite late. The food was great albeit a bit pricey. We slept very well and in the morning had a good tour around the ship.

If you want a five star place to stay the QM might not be for you. We chose it with another couple for the start of a road trip up the Pacific Coast Highway and we enjoyed it. We only stayed for one night. The prices are higher in October because of all of the Halloween happenings including special haunting tours on the ship and a huge Halloween festival adjacent to the ship. Anyone wanting to attend those might find it convenient to be staying on the ship. Our room was a King with a harbor view. That does n\u2019t mean what it means on today \u2019s cruise ships. We had two portholes but for the small additional cost it was nice to be able to look at the view across the harbor to Long Beach. We particularly enjoyed the Glory Days tour we took and viewing other galleries and exhibits such as the engine room.

This review is more about my day visit to the ship and not the hotel. Follow GPS and the signs and you will be taken to the parking area which they charge you 18 for the day. Again follow the signs and you will find the ticket booth. Your ticket costs 32 and includes 2 tours which you select when getting your ticket. There are a number of discounts available. those I remember are age 55 and AAA. This tour is about history if you like history you will like this place. I went on the the Glory Days tour which gives you a good overview of the ship and the haunted tour which was OK. what was good about the haunted tour was you got to see more of the ship. These tours have a lot of walking and stairs. You do not have to have a ticket to walk around the ship just take the elevator to the 4th floor or Promenade floor to get started. With out a ticket you ca n\u2019t do the tours see the movie or the engine room. If you see most of the exhibits and do 2 tours this will take at least 3 hours. The Observation bar is nice. the bar area is very art but the chairs and tables are cheap and do n\u2019t really fit the decor. They should upgrade the lounge area to more reflect the era. Prices are reasonable. Overall this is a good visit if you like history. It was interesting to learn about the ship and its past. Kids would get bored with this in about 10 minutes. There is a snack bar and a sit down cafe along with too full service restaurant. However the restaurants do n\u2019t open until 5.

My wife and I visited from Australia and in the 20 years I have been coming to the US I had never made the trek to see The Queen Mary. We bought tickets to see Aiden Sinclair who was performing on the ship in his Illusions of the Passed show. I guess I use the term show loosely. This was an experience. One that left us questioning how did he do that and pondering life itself long after the curtain closed. Aiden is a special human and also. he is an awesome guy. The first night we arrived to see him perform I got food poisoning from the restaurant upstairs. Subsequently we had to leave. I will spare you all with the details. Aiden was super amazing and told my wife that we could have a full refund. I was really disappointed that we had to leave so instead of a refund I asked the staff if we could just re book for the next week before we flew home. The staff re issued our VIP tickets and we were able to attend a few days later. Although the staff did not put us on Aidens list and we did not get the VIP package that we had paid for. This was not Aidens fault and after a few minutes in to the show I forgot all about not being in the front row because Aiden was a master at engaging every single person in the room and making you feel part of it all. We were very lucky to come on a Thursday right before Christmas when it was quiet. Go and see Aiden Sinclair. I promise you will be blown away. The Queen Mary has a certain magic to it. So many great times were had on this ship and you can really feel that when you step on board.
