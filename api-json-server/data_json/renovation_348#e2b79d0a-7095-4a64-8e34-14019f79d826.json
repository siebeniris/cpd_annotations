I Love You. Aw Detroit. I have seen you evolve and devolve over the past 14 years and last seven visits only to see something new and beautiful evolve once again out of your ashes and urban decay. I knew you would come around again so I saddled up and flew out for my favorite time of year the Detroit Electronic Music Festival or Movement as it has been called in recent years. The difference this year. I am older now and wanting to really check out Detroit and be a touch away from Hart Plaza where all of the festivities and noise are located. I thought I might stay in Corktown the oldest neighborhood in Detroit and see what all of the fuss was about. Thus I chose the Corktown Hotel which touts itself as a part of Detroit is history and is located in this historic neighborhood near many landmarks and newly sprouted restaurants. After some confusion about prices sometimes the websites that sell rooms for hotels do not always communicate with the hotel itself. I work at a hotel and it happens all of the time. Suzete graciously showed me to my newly remodeled room. And what a room it was. The room itself was made up of refurbished items everything from a rustic modern desk to the lamps which looked like they were made out of piping. The bed frame seemed to be made of refurbished wood with melted glass details. This along with with a large flat screen tv a modern chair and futon and modern touches in the bathroom made our room feel more like a cool uptown apartment than an old hotel. We felt at ease and at home instantly. Much like Detroit the Corktown Hotel is being renovated one space at a time so they do not have a lot of newly renovated rooms yet but that is the beauty of it. You get to be part of the renaissance happening in Detroit just by visiting. You are supporting the economy and staying in a historic part of town and helping revive a cool old school hotel. So ask for a newly renovated room when you do stay there.

We arrived in Detroit for a two day trip and chose the Trumbull hotel. The hotel is located in a quiet section of Detroit and has free parking. If you do not think free parking is a perk just wait until you head downtown Detroit to sight see. Most parking is between 10 20 The hotels exterior and interior were clean and tastefully decorated. The front staff was polite and thoughtful. No issues checking in or out. However the room we were in did not have curtains. We told the front staff and they were apologetic and quick to make sure we were satisfied. They ended up moving us to a new room which I did not think was necessary but was a nice gesture. Luckily we got to view two different rooms the reviews are the same for both. The room itself was small but cozy and clean. We did not hear any street noise or noise from other guests. The pictures online match what it looks like in person. The mini fridge was clean. There are plenty of mirrors in the room and it is well lit. Overall this is a nice place to stay if you want comfort and quality. A previous reviewer mentioned that the room was good for a prisoner. I think the opinion is exaggerated. Yes the walls are white but it gives the illusion of a larger space design 101. We rested our heads and were pleased during our stay. One must remember that this hotel is a work in progress and so far we they are doing a fabulous job. Much respect to this hotel for trying to revitalize Detroit. The next time we are in Detroit we had definitely return. PS to Hotel Management Hopefully there are no future plans to install carpet because we liked the refurbished cement floors.

This past week my wife and I booked two rooms at Trumbull and Porter. Our aim was to be in a good location for exploring Cork Town and Midtown where our son plans to live in a few months. T and P is the perfect hotel for this purpose. The hotel itself has undergone a top to bottom renovation in recent years and it is evident that the work is still in progress. We loved being there though and did not mind skirting the workers who were busy installing new windows in the hallway leading to the elevator. This is a hotel for travelers who want something that is quite a bit different from the lackluster design of the cookie cutter motor inns that dot the freeways. Trumbull and Porter is a design forward hotel pleasing to the eye and extraordinarily functional. The rooms although small are clean comfortable and pleasant. The bar restaurant and lovely outdoor spaces provide great lounging options for guests. Travelers can even enjoy hanging out in the lobby featuring a wall with David Blairs wonderful Ode to Detroit emblazoned upon it. Also in the lobby I enjoyed paging through and reading from books about the rebirth of the city. In fact I have since purchased two of them. One of them Detroit. The Dream is Now is a wonderful tribute to the great design renovation and rich history of the city. It makes you want to live there and be part of the vibrant renaissance that is currently well underway there. The book features photos of many places that are actually near the hotel some within walking distance. The entertainment options nearby are unparalleled too. The restaurants in particular are amazing. Several notable places are within walking distance or a very short drive from the hotel. In fact one might even use one of the cool bicycles that are available for guests to explore the immediate area. I can not say enough about the staff at Trumbull and Porter. Everybody there understands the essence of hospitality. Everybody. Front desk housekeeping bar tenders servers groundskeepers all were so cordial and helpful. We even had a nice conversation with the manager one morning. Of the fabulous Nina who anchors the lobby as barista concierge extraordinaire he said is not she great. it is like coming home.

However on the other hand the quality of the rooms and amenities is LESS than what you are paying for. The mattresses are not very comfortable and the sheets are not cotton which is a huge comfort factor for me. There is no coffee maker in the room and no free coffee in the lobby they expect you to pay 3 4 dollars for a coffee. Also there was a lot of imperfections in the room like fixtures that were moved and the previous holes were not repaired properly or at all. It just seemed like their maintenance guy who does small repairs is totally unprofessional and doing repairs at a college frat house level. The thing that really rubbed me the wrong way and was sorta the last straw to make me reduce my rating from 4 to 3 was the prices they charge in their pantry. 6 dollars for a cheap tiny little frozen burrito. even 4star hotels do not upcharge that much. So basically if you are getting a hotel to party downtown for a night go to an event or meet a date I highly recommend this place. 55. but if you are doing an extended stay past 2 days or a business trip and just want a relaxing comfortable place I would give 25 for that kind of stay.
