Just stayed here this week for business and while they had some nice renovations to an old building in a great walking area it \u2019s a complete disaster. As a new Hilton Diamond member coming from Mariot Ambassador and I can clearly see the lack of proper training by this Hilton property. No acknowledgement of status except for getting 2 bottles of water in a paper brown bag. Door men are asleep at the wheel with helping with bags and valet service. Walls are paper thin so I was woken by next door neighbors bring home love from the club at 3 am. Called the front desk and security did nothing the first time. At 330 I called again when they finally knocked on the door which did n\u2019t help. Having people raging at 3 4am is not great but worse is a property who drags their feet on fixing the problem. Even the neighbor across the hall said something about it the next morning. Check out was apathetic no help no questions about my stay especially with Hilton \u2019s \u201c make it right guarantee \u201d. Sadly another false marketing ploy to get you to spend money at a subpar serviced hotel. This is no more than a 15 star property with lipstick on the greatest day ever. Such a historic place and the developer wasted a ton of capital when its run no better than a cheap motel down the road. Mariot is n\u2019t perfect but come on guys at least be competitive.

Let me begin by saying that the service was mostly excellent and friendly. From the valet to the guest services rep when you called for something though every other call went unanswered the first timeI came for a wedding about ten years ago and had fond memories of the hotel. But things today are quite different. It has the Hilton makeover which adds a little life to this but the structure is the same old small noisy. There are very few amenities and all come at a premium. I chose this stay for two reasons the manager secured my business by re extending a rate that had just expired and I wanted to try out my new diamond status that I had to charge 400 last year to get. Kudos to the manager diamond status on the other hand is quickly headed to non renewal. Upon check in I was greeted by a very cute and friendly redhead who told me they were behind on housekeeping and the only room they had available was on the first floor. I asked her if with my diamond status if it was possible I could get a room with a seating area as I had a business meeting with another individual. She said she could put me in a different room handed me my keys and I rode up to the 12th floor one below the penthouse. Unfortunately a high floor room was all my diamond status got me which is what gold status would \u2019ve gotten me. The room was clean and nice but tiny. It had a small loveseat at the base of the bed about 3 feet from TV and facing the TV. Literally impossible for 2 people to face each other even if one is on bed and talk. The door rattled which I fixed by wedging in one of the 50 unnecessary placards and cards they have in the room and the shower pipes rattled and the water sputtered but it went away after a few minutes. The body wash shampoo and conditioner are in large dispensers affixed today the shower wall which is something usually used by gyms and Airbnb \u2019s. But the bathroom was spacious towels soft clearly the best part of the room. Hit the fitness room briefly which was small but had a good selection of free weights and treadmills. There were no towels and I did n\u2019t bother calling as I knew housekeeping was stretched thin. I took my meeting in the lobby and again the staff was exceptionally friendly. They wear jeans as part of their uniform and it adds an unnecessarily casual element to the environment. The lobby bar area is small and not very lively even on a Saturday night. When the meeting concluded I checked the website again and saw larger rooms not even suites were still available leaving me to wonder further what good is diamond status. The location is good and I was able to walk to an event at the Jonathan Club four blocks away. Other than the rattling door and pipes there was no noise to interfere with sleep. TV had no premium movies or pay per view movies. Did n\u2019t bother with WiFi. Overall the staff does their best to be friendly and attentive but they are n\u2019t always there when you call. Valet at checkout time was overwhelmed and it took about 15 min from when I called to get my car. The rates are not very competitive and parking is 49. I wo n\u2019t stay here again especially when third party aps had rooms at the Biltmore across the street for less than what I paid with a special rate. That \u2019s a lot more hotel for your money.", "offset": [694, 781], "date": "2020-02-23", "cpt": "2", "category": "renovation"}]}
