My husband and I booked the Million Miles from Monday special and also added early check in for an additional charge 100 am and with the package you do not check out until 40 pm the next day so almost like two full days for the price of one. We booked a corner king suite and will include a couple of photos. It was room 21 and it was nice because it was the floor to be as far as coming and going. We booked a couples massage and it was nice along with playing golf though it rained we had fun until hole 14 and enjoyed breakfast and a rain break at the golf clubhouse. Of course we went to the winery and a huge shout out to Lucy also in photo. as she served us and also led a tour we tagged along on. We ate dinner at the new restaurant at the winery Marc and it was nice. They even made us a cheese and meat tray that was not exactly on the menu. there was a meat tray but not cheese. We both had steaks. My husbands meal pictured was rib eye which I thought was odd it was Market Price and mine was a filet and it was priced on the menu. I have not seen that before. He said it was good but not sure why it could not be priced on menu. Seems like it was pretty high but he said it was good. With the package you receive 200 resort credits to be used as you see fit and it is good but we spent way more doing all the fun things.

We were celebrating our 1 year dating anniversary and decided to spend one night at the Inn. After checking in we went to do the wine tasting before our dinner at Marc.

They did offer us a complimentary glass of wine while we waited again. Our food came out again and even though it was n\u2019t cold the meat was dry and definitely not seasoned well. I had much better steaks before for way less money. When we went back to the Inn we went to their bar. They were playing jazz and that all they played. We went back to the hotel room and could not sleep at all because the bed was way too soft and not comfortable. The pillows was very very soft and big. We were uncomfortable and checked out at 7 am.

It all started with my two colleagues and I booking an overnight stay to work and enjoy an evening with the girls. After HOURS of shooting around the property we went downstairs to have dinner at Versailles. Upon sitting we noticed there was only one other couple at the restaurant so we thought perfect our food should be out fast. Boy were we wrong. Not only did it take a long time for the waitress to even come acknowledge us she rushed us. I could totally understand a busy night but on Monday because the winery is n\u2019t open it was completely dead. Our waitress Emie was unfriendly and cold the entire time taking our order. Once we finally were able to order our food came out lukewarm. I was so confused but as I said we were tired and hungry so we ate. Plus we did n\u2019t want anyone to spit in our food. they gave off a warning vibe. We ordered a bottle of wine and would n\u2019t you know it. after tracking her down we had to ask for her to give us clean glasses and water which she reluctantly did and with an eye roll. Needless to say we ended up pouring our own drinks. We eat and asked for a to go bag. She finds one behind the hostess stand and hands me a Chinese take out plastic bag. My colleagues kind of chuckled at how embarrassed she was for the restaurant as she had just traveled from paris just weeks before coming here and definitely was n\u2019t handed a plastic bag to take her food in. After dinner we took a few pictures and headed to our room. We were in our room for roughly an hour before we hear loud banging on the door and a woman clearly drunk and in distress asking for her friend \u201c Andrea \u201d. After opening the door to assist her she assaults us in the doorway. My colleague called security atleast 6 7 times before anyone even answers. It \u2019s 1 am and here I am with two other women having to fight off this lady trying to break in our room. After an elapsed time of about 20 30 mins security finally strolls down the hall all nonchalantly and starts arguing with US. He sees the other woman in the hallway and automatically takes her side. It got worse by what ensued next. Not only did he verbally attack me by telling me to \u201c shut the fck up \u201d he also motioned towards me in a threatening manner and gets right in my face and says \u201c did n\u2019t I tell you to be quiet \u201d. I am completely baffled at how this is a 5 star 4 diamond hotel. I was treated like I was at a motel 8 at dinner then I go to my room just to be attacked by a stranger to then be threatened by security. luxury hotel where. The police should \u2019ve been called on their end and they never did until I called at around 10 am. I asked for management and for her to be put out the hotel she was escorted downstairs just for her to be brought right back to her room where she had a greats night rest right in the room next to us for the entire night. There is also a video of the attack that I am gladly posting on all social media platforms. No one deserves to be treated like they \u2019re second rate threatened or assaulted while in a supposedly luxury safe environment. I \u2019ve worked with some of the most luxurious resorts around the world and NEVER had any of this happen to me before. I am holding the hotel their lack of security and this woman responsible for the events leading up to the bruises and scratches on my arms.

We got the same service that we had been getting the entire time about 45 minutes for anything. She got some sort of chicken dish that was mediocre at best. I ordered the porter house steak which was the worst steak I have ever tasted in my life. As soon as the waiter put the stake down I smelled what I can only describe as rancid meat. I took one bite and had to spite it out. The steak tasted like rotten meat covered with pepper. That night we both spent several hours in the restrooms being violently sick.
