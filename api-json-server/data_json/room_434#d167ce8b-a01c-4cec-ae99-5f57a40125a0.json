First off yes the hotel is on the older side but do not let that fool you. It is super clean and I ca nt imagine that the view could get better. When we arrive we were greeted at the reception with a very nice drink as we checked in. We got there about 10 am so we knew that the room would not be ready. A tip on that is pack a small backpack with to change in the bathroom so you can use the pool while you wait for the room. The bell staff will take care of the rest of your luggage. The pools were large and very clean. the swim up bar is where all that day time action takes place with the entertainment staff. If you prefer a quiter setting there is the upper pool that is nice also. Our room was upgraded at the desk. Has to be one of the best rooms in the place. The balcony was the size of our room there are only a couple of these rooms. The room was clean and close to everything but far enough away to escape. The restaurants were out standing. I was not expecting the food to be great ok but no great and I was wrong. The food was amazing. We ate in all of the restaurants. Our favorite was the breakfast buffet not because of the food but because of Juan Jose or J. He waited on us everyday and was awesome. One day at lunch they even grilled out fresh red fish by the pool. outstanding. Bars. The taco tiki hut was nice. Try the fish tacos. In the evening the lobby bar can be fun also. We hit some bars in downtown Cancun for happy hour. If you are interested in that just go out front to the bus stop and hop on for 1 each way. Defiantly would go back here again.

Hello we are a family of 3 and one on the way this is our experience and a what you may expect and of course our opinion of what we experienced. Arriving. The hotel is a short drive from the airport 20 25 min depending on the driver. The cost of the taxi is about 109 dollars. Let me break it down its 170 pesos each person on a collective ride which means once they have filled up they go or 680 pesos for a private cab which means you have your own cab each way. The cabs are a 7 8 person vans. You can arrange transportation from your initial reservation but it felt expensive just to find out it was just as expensive to wait and get a cab. They offer the ride back at a 50 discount if you purchase at the same time. therefor my total was about 109 dollars. It is cheaper if you pay in pesos but be careful they were exchanges at a rate of 10 pesos dollar at the airport when the regular rate was 180 p d. So if possible exchange before. so if your party is of 3 or more that is they way to go. Check In As you arrive at the hotel you are received with enthusiasm and smiles. At check in they strap on the plastic bands around your wrist and they will charge you 150 if lost. They also explain that they have 4 restaurants Asian cuisine Mexican buffet Italian and the grill. they 5th one is not included steakhouse. Also that the room service is included OMG Included. The Italian restaurant is only available to kids under 13 before 7 pm We got our room and key and we were off. Rooms. We got to our room and it was a disappointment. However it was not the hotels fault we purchased a lagoon view thinking it was going to be OK but it really was not we were unhappy with our choice. the room seemed nice and comfortable its just our thing to have an ocean view. The luggage arrived as soon as we made our decision to try to change rooms we walked down stairs and asked for a better room of course knowing about the upcharge they were booked solid. We inquired about the suites they had the master suite at 215 dollars more per night we asked nicely and knowing we were there for 6 nights they agreed on 100 a night for the master suite. We got our stuff and now tired and hungry carried our bodies to the Sun Tower. We had a master suite with our own Jacuzi and balcony overlooking the whole ocean front from tip to tip. It was a wonderful room. The complain about the room was that the Jacuzi needed another good scrubbing before using which was done the next day and the shower entrance was high and wide you have to open your legs wide and hop a little to get in and out. My wife is pregnant and was able to endure but was not very safe in her conditions. The Grill restaurantSo now that we are happy with our room and somewhat refreshed we head out to eat something anything. We head to the pool were we see the grill. We unknowingly bypass the hostess you have to check in at every restaurant. her stand was at one end of the round tables scattered on the pool patio. We had a delicious dinner We were hungry so i guess that is why everything tasted so great. You get a table with 10 chairs that you share with any guest that need a seat. We had a family of 5 seat next to us it was their 2 or 3rd day there. they advised us not be shy and eat drink and enjoy all we wanted. He also got a Johnny Bravo for me a sweet drink that packs a punch. too sweet for me but i did enjoy it. They had a good variety of foods but a great selection of grilled meats chicken pork beef fish and clam. Our daughter jumped in the first pool she saw but joined us afterward she enjoyed some fruit and chicken. We then rested a little and moved on to their show. As it gets dark you have to start guessing what they are serving they definitely need more lighting on the food maybe they keep it dim so the bugs do not swarm around but it does get hard to see what you are eating. By the way no sign of mosquitos flyes or any anoying bugs. Mexican Show They have shows every night. Tonight was the Mexican show. Great dancing good energy and overall it sucks you in to their festival. They also serving drinks the whole time so it was a great experience. After this it was time to sleep and rest up. Room Service The next morning we decide to try the room service feature. We order 4 plates including the fruit platter highly recommend. The food was great it does however take from 30 60 min to arrive so order accordingly. After breakfast we decide to head to the beach. The beach We found the beach to be clean. A good distance from the steps to allow a volleyball court and a soccer court. Then the edge of the beach. If you wanted a seat you had to carry a seat to the edge it was no big issue. But the big problem that we ran to was that it was kelp season. that is what i called it. every 4 years apparently the ocean throws up kelp or seawedthe whole beach was covered in sea weed. you could still get in and out but it was a little annoying specially since we always heard the Cancun beaches were always white and best. We were able to enjoy the beach regardless and had some good tumbles in the wave which i enjoy. They do have service all the way out there drinks and food but they do take time since they have to walk a ways its faster to get your own drinks. There are only few merchants walking the beach so no annoying interruptions of your time and they have a life guard on duty it feels safe and relaxing. The beach was a little rough the first 4 days and then it was like very calm i prefer the waves but we did experience both. on thew last 2 days the seaweed cleared up a lot and the pictures we took looked better. Pool All pools are clean wells spaced and are well maintained. There were a lot of people there but it never felt crowded however you have to get up pretty early to score a beach chair near prime areas with shade and near the pool. We got up a couple of days at 8AM and went down to reserve some seats for later. Most people will respect your towel as taken chair. They have service around the pools drinks and food. Depending on where you and how crowded it is you can wait up to 3 8 min so when you see the waiters ask for drinks and food even before you finish your last one you will have time to finish it while they get back. Mexican Restaurant So we went to try the mexicano restaurant probably the worst experience with a happy ending. We arrive and walk up to the hostess. She is busy writing things down and looking at her chart. We wait for a sign of acknowledgement. I finally walk up to her and ask her for a table she acts like she just saw us. We still wait and see 2 other parties get seated. We were a party of 5 at this point my family and 2 friends. We finally get seated on the hottest area of the restaurant. Yes its Cancun and its hot so we endured. After ordering we start getting hotter no breeze and the fan above us does not work. We had order a 4 course dinner. The drinks came out after 20 min and then the appetizers after 30 min and then the salads after another 20. We were hot still hungry and getting annoyed parties around us were getting in served and leaving. We endured and only asked about our food and if it possible to change us to a table under a fan. they said all the tables were full. we were looking at several we would be happy with another 20 minutes and my daughter was little fainting from the heat. We asked again about our main course and if we can move tables after a lack of attention we got up and left. On our way out Antonio the Captain stopped us and inquired of out situation. We were upset but politely told him what happened he sincerely apologized and begged us to stay and that he would take care of us. We were hungry and wanted to eat so we stayed. They cleared a table in the air conditioned room which i guess magically appeared since they did not have any tables anywhere and joy our food came in 5 minutes. we were also treated to a desert specially prepared by the chef Jorge. We were semi happy but we would not come back. Before we left the captain and the chef Antonio and Jorge invited us to come back the next time for a surprised that we do nt want to miss. We declined but after persuasiveness we agreed. The next night we were treated to the best experienced i ve ever had in a restaurant we had a 5 course meal prepared by the chef himself and all at the table. I ca nt name all the fancy ingredients and plates but it was very exquisite and the attention to detail was superb. They treated us like royalty and made a loyal customer of every one of us. At the end we were full our bellies and our hearts were satisfied with their art. Thank you to our server Salvador The Captain Antonio. and of course the chef Jorge. what they prepared is not on the menu but we are glad we came back. The Buffet. It is well stacked clean and delicious. Ca nt find a lot of words to describe this restaurant. It has anything you want if they do not you can ask and they will try their best to get it for you. Good experience good food. Asian restaurant Also delicious and very attentive service. my wife ordered something she did not like and they gladly took it back and she selected something else. good place and the best view of the ocean from here. Italian We were sent away because we got there at 645 and we had a kid under 13 so no review on these guys. This resort switched to all inclusive since October so you will find servers adapting to this new concept. The all inclusive offers all paid including tips but they are still expecting tips and can lead to a little awkwardness at times. We tipped every server but not everyone does and it leads to an inbalance of service. They might come around often if you tip them after every drink they bring or not much if you tip at the end when they leave at 5 6 pm andor you leave. They do work hard and with a smile most of the time. Do nt expect WI fi unles near the front desk. I highly recommend this hotel you will not be disappointed.", "offset": [1423, 1533], "date": "2015-07-15", "cpt": "0", "category": "room"}, {"id": 7, "uid": "a044eae4-408f-4a64-9cd3-37443416ec4d", "sentence": "A true Mexican experience.

One day after being at the pool we came in for a about five minutes and a housekeeper came out of the bathroom while the door was shut and claimed she was cleaning but had no supplies or service cart in our area of the room. The beach was gorgeous definitely a great spot. The resort itself was very nice and well kept. The food selection was the best. The only good things I could leave saying was the great food quality and variety along with a good atmosphere that was well maintained except for our room. Also the staff decided to do things like clean windows and switch out all the lounge chairs by the pool in the middle of the day as people were out and about and I felt most of that stuff should have been done in the morning when most people were not around or even using the chairs.

To be honest our complaint is with Expedia. We booked out trip in early Jan 2018. If Expedia would have put a disclaimer that Fiesta Americana Condesa was under a remodel we would not have stayed here. Now that being said. When we first arrived my wife and I were not impressed. We were not greeted when we were dropped off nobody was present to collect our luggage etc. We checked in received a cocktail and some virgin pina coladas for the kids. Once we got into the lobby everything was under construction the bar was makeshift chairs were pushed into the lobby to assemble a make shift lounge. Not impressed but how much time will we bee inside right. When we got up to our room on the 5th floor we had jackhammers starting at 8 am outside our patio door. When we opened our door to start our day we had the sound of metal work behind us so construction on both sides. Now were were extremely upset this was supposed to be a relaxing vacation if we wanted construction noise we could have stayed home and listen to the builders behind us. But it gets better. We met with the Chief Concierge Edgar. He listened to our complaints and we were not very nice about it but that was understandable we could have spent out money somewhere else but chose AFC. Edgar was wonderful he listened to our complaints and made everything right by us. We traveled with another family. Edgar was able to upgrade our 2 rooms. He moved us next to each other and we had a great beachocean view. On top of that he had roses sent up to the room chocolate covered strawberries and champagne sent up for the first couple of nights. He checked on us throughout the week to ensure everything was going well. At checkout Edgar meet us and once again checked in with us to ensure that our stay was wonderful. Throughout the week I did thank Edgar for his wonderful customer service. Through his outstanding customer service we will definitely be back after the remodel is complete. The serving staff was also outstanding for the most part. We had wonderful servers especially J and Isabella. J is an all around fabulous masero funny engaging just a wonderful person.
