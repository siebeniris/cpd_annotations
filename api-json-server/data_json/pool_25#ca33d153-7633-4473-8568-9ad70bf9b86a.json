Overall a beautifully and perfectly unique experience surrounded by landscapes straight out of paradise. Honestly as I write this review I can not think of a single fault. This is not even mentioning the service which was one of the best parts of the experience. Everyone was professional but extremely friendly and genuine which is sometimes a rarity at a hotel of this caliber. Everyone from our GEM to housekeeping were fantastic. Our experience was made on the final evening with a great buffet at the Hilltop Reserve with our waitress regrettably can not remember her name who was one of the most genuine and friendly hotel employees we have ever encountered. Just walking around the resort is a treat in itself. The value you get at this hotel from food to drinks amenities to room is second to none.

We spent a week at the hotel in March. With my feedback i might be a bit critical but a hotel at this price level everything needs to be perfect. Overall we did enjoy the stay very much but there were a few things that really bothered me. 1. A standard room has no sea view at all. Hotels at similar price levels eg Maldives or Bora Bora Maui etc will always offer sea view also in the standard category. Be aware of this2. The bungalow we had was a bit worn down. You would see this at the cupboards and walls. Again at this price level I would expect them to keep the standard as high as eg a four season hotel does over the years. Also our beed linen had a hole and the towels had some spots from sun screen etc which do not go out when being washed. 3. The beds this was the biggest let down. Both my wife and I had the worst back pain after two nights at the hotel. We asked for a different mattress more firm but it did not really help. We do not have back problems and work out and as we both experienced this I thought it is worth to highlight. 4. The beach. For me this is not a beach resort as the beach is a bit rough and the sea is not clear. The water is a bit milky and it is not as inviting as in other locations. But this is not a hotel issue it is like this in the region. So this were the issues that I wanted to mention. On the pro side the service of the staff especially the locals is absolutely fantastic. Food is great if not fantastic the view at the hilltop is breathtaking you must see the sunrise and if you like to relax in your bungalow at the pool this is the perfect place for you. Especially for people who practice yoga this is a must go place. Its also great for families with small kids. Just make sure you book a bungalow with ocean view otherwise you feel like in the jungle camp.", "offset": [1452, 1636], "date": "2016-03-16", "cpt": "0", "category": "pool"}, {"id": 4, "uid": "c2224879-8c80-4338-b741-34d7d43d5af7", "sentence": "Six senses remains the best experience in my travel life. we stayed one week at Six Senses Yao Noi.

There was not one thing we could have criticised. We were so well taken care of by our GEM the food is at a standard me a French men can recommend to anyone. the complementary morning course at the gym in front of the forest is so energizing we went on beautiful escursions the choice is plenty and the villa is divine.

Our GEM Gwen is such a lovely kind lady and she ensured that everything went perfectly during our stay at Six Senses from bringing ice to our room and booking us in for a session in the complimentary hotel sauna and steamrom to offering advice and good cheer on a daily basis. She welcomed us at the pier on arrival and waved us off when we left. Thank you so much Gwen. And thank you to Six Senses for all of our wonderful honeymoon treats. We were overwhelmed by the welcome chocolates and coconut water the bottle of proceso the complimentary couples massage best massage EVER. and also the in villa dining so delicious such presentation and attention to detail. we were thoroughly spoiltThere \u2019s nothing I can say about the amazing villas that has n\u2019t been said already. We stayed in the hideaway villa and it was our own private tropical paradise in the middle of the jungle. All of the in room extras are very much appreciated from the options of bug spray cream burner etc to the raincoats and umbrellas. Fresh and dried fruits plus the usual tea and coffee were complimentary in the rooms plus as much freshly bottled water as you could drink. Every villa has their own private pool which was a real treat to us. We also enjoyed the outside shower. It \u2019s the exceptionally friendly and helpful staff that really go above and beyond to ensure your stay is enjoyable thank you so much to each and every one of you. Everyone greets you with a smile and welcome. They really are a credit to the hotel and help to make your whole holiday an experience on you will look back on with a smile and fond memories. Plus all the little extras things that really makes this hotel stand out. where else can you get complimentary ice cream and cookies every day all day. Watch a movie on the beach or try out waterspouts such as paddle boarding and windsurfing completely free of chargeGuests were also offered complimentary afternoon tea by the hilltop pool which was delicious one rainy day. The management meet and greet on the Tuesday evening was really lovely. We sat by the infinity pool and gazed our at the incredible views sipping on proseco I lost count of my glass being topped up but think I drank a bottle by myself. and Mai tai cocktails and nibbling on the most delicious canap\u00e9s small but works of art and so tastyThe hilltop infinity pool truly is a highlight \u2026 and who could tire of the amazing views you experience all around the resort. The pool does not open to guests until 11 am but we asked our GEM and as the house was not being used by guests one morning we were allowed access so we could view the sunset from the infinity pool an experience we would highly recommend. Memories to cherish forever Bugies are just a call away to transport guests around the resort. However we only ever used the buggy service if one passed us on the roads and offered us a lift as we enjoyed walking around the lush gardens and everywhere is literally only a 5 minute walk away at most although there are a few small hills. Good to walk off the huge breakfastThe trips are expensive but I \u2019m sure would be fantastic we just rang out of time during our 1 week stay and the weather during the wet season really is WET. We experienced rain and clouds and storms most days of our stay with only an hour or two sunshine. We did n\u2019t eat at either of the hotel restaurants either partly due to the cost and partly due to breakfast being so amazing we rarely ate for the rest of the day. From dozens of cereals breads pastries fruits salad to full English options to curries and other Asian goodies to eggs cooked anywhere you like and pancakes waffles and crepes made to order. Amazing choice. We generally had 5 courses and then could n\u2019t eat again until a snack later in the eveningThere are complimentary yoga classes every morning at 8 am above the gym for an hour the rest of the classes throughout the day are chargeable aprox \u00a3 30 each. The gym is open 24 hours a day and is small but well equipped. If I had to make one suggestion it would be that the air con here could be lowered to a cooler temperature. As exercising in 18 degrees is far too hut for us Brits. lolWe did tour the island using their tuktuk tour which cost 180 Thai Baht for the two of us. I do n\u2019t know if it was the weather grey and drizzly. but I thought this was a little disappointing as there is just so little to see. The brief rice paddy visit was the highlight of the 2 hour tour but we tied in with a necessary visit to the pharmacy so good to leave the resort. We did plan on hiring a moped ourselves little business near to hotel entrance on main road but as the roads were wet did n\u2019t fancy it for our first ever bike experience. There is only the 1 main road around the island though and can travel the whole island in an hour. Going on other guest recommendations we left the hotel on an evening to try out the nearby restaurants La Luna the local pizzeria is aprox 7 mins from hotel main entrance walking down the road to the right and the Thai restaurant Chan \u2019s is literally 2 doors to the left of the entrance. Both served delicious food at reasonable prices. we paid aprox \u00a3 20 for our meals and soft drinks. Whereas the cheaper options at the hotel restaurant start around \u00a3 15 per meal but I \u2019m sure it would be delicious. We just rang out of time during our stay. By the way the Wifi all around the resort is exceptional. Even free wifi on the boat to the island. lol And the transfers were seamless you are treat like royalty with welcome drinks ice towels and exceptional service every step of the way. We were sad to leave and will most definitely be saving up to come back again one year soon. Next time we would visit in the dry season however to experience a little more sunshine and I am eager to try out the early morning yoga class on the platform overlooking the ocean.", "offset": [1832, 2054], "date": "2016-09-14 00:00:00", "cpt": "0", "category": "pool"}, {"id": 6, "uid": "2285b7db-8543-4f5e-8cd9-f30889988a5c", "sentence": "Beautiful.

This was for us addicted but sometimes disappointed Aman junkies the first stay at a Six Senses resort and only one step away from Paradise. The pick up at Phuket airport was a bit disorganized and slow but once we were in the car to the marina tranquillity set in. The speed boat transfer to the island was fast and comfortable and the personalized welcome sign on the buggy which brought us to our villa a nice touch. The resort offers quite a large and frankly a bit confusing choice of different villa types but we were glad we had chosen a Panorama one although the view from most villas is stunning. The bed room was huge the bath room large and the outdoor area fantastic. Six Senses style is rustic so do expect more of a Club Med than a Bulgari feeling and get used to not flushing the toilet paper small part of the one step away.

When booking our Far East trip 47 days 13 flights 5 countries. we were literally going through each country. date and looking for 2 Bedroom villas. We found one here and booked it online. Silly and our fault for not looking at the configuration of the duplex but it was not a 2 Bedroom villa. It was 2 separate villas sharing a pool and connected by outdoor stairs. It probably should have a description of 2 externally connecting 1 bedroom villas. Anyway we had a 4 year old who could not be left alone in a villa next to the pool at the bottom of the stairs and this is probably the one bit that let this hotel down. They saw our booking saw the age our the child and did not ask if our booking was a mistake. On arrival the day bed in one of the villas had been made up for our son as they rightly assumed he could not stay by himself. So we had a villa totally wasted and unlike Dhara Dhevi did not offer an alternative to claw back some mistakenly spent funds. Other than that our previous hotel did most of the arranging of transfers on our behalf. We were transferred by a private speedboat to the hotel where we enjoyed glass bottles water and a fabulous ride through the islands. We were greeted by the hotel Manager and our Butler Ben. Ben showed us to our Villa and took us on a tour of the hotel in a golf buggy. It is the most spectacular hotel we have stayed at with the most incredible views. The infinity pool must have one of the best views from a pool in the worldWe again had mixed weather here but we did manage to enjoy the pool. it is not particularly child friendly in that we were conscious it was such an idyllic quiet spot our raucous 4 year old bombing in the pool and screaming Mummy or Daddy at the top of hus lungs was not relaxing for us. But we did still absolutely love it. We ate around the pool a couple of times and the food was excellent and allergies were handled with no fuss at all. Ben arranged for our transport up to the pool. We did trek up the hill one day which was fun but would have been hard work in the height of summer with the heat. Our room was fantastic. Trehouse type accommodation and being wooden with the heat and the damp the wood had started to warp but it added to the charm. We did have a totally private villa and very conveniently located a stones throw from the bar and restaurant areas. The pool at the villa was great fun but sadly not really warm enough when we were there due to the amount of rain they had. Have mentioned this is in other hotel reviews but if you want shiny marble bling with no character do not stay hereOne morning my son and I took a golf buggy to their organic chicken farm where you can collect your eggs for breakfast. It was absolutely amazing and our son loved it. We took them back and the chef made us scrambled and poached eggs which had delicious orange yokes. Ben was superb and got our son a little bucket and spade set to play with at the beach and round the pool he had a watering can. There was a hotel across the water in Krabi we stayed at years ago that cooked an incredible Penang curry. The weather was not good enough for us to get a boat over and sadly the hotel would not share the recipe but Ben organised for the chefs to cook their version for us. It really was such a nice touch and greatly appreciated. Their Green Thai curry was awesome too and I ate this a couple of times when staying as could not resist. All the staff were amazing and they were so friendly with our son too. We only ate in the Living Room in the evening as it is most casual for children and the food was delicious. We did also sample come canapes on their happy hour evenings in the bar. Overall we had an incredible stay and along with Dhara Dhevi one of the best hotels on our trip.

Where do I begin. My husband and I stayed here during the middle part of our Thailand honeymoon vacation. Let me start by saying Thailand is a beautiful country in general each island we went to was more beautiful than the first. As our boat pulled up to Six Senses we were greeted by the smiley friendly staff and had our own buggy bring us up to our room. I did nt know we had our own Guest Experience Manager and that added such a luxurious touch to our stay. Ben was our GEM and we just loved himWe stayed in Villa 39 One of the Ocean Panorama Villas. When we opened the door to our villa we could not believe our eyes. The view is absolutely spectacular nothing like it. We had a outside living room area on the top floor of our villa. As you go down the stairs you see your own private pool and the HUGE windows all around the villa. The villa was immaculate and beautiful. Bedroom. The bed was so comfortable and they have a catalog of about 12 different pillows that you can choose your style of firm to softness we LOVED that. They have a turn down service each night where they come in and get your bed ready for sleeping. They can put your choice of essential oils underneath your pillow Seriously how nice is that. and they roll the mosquito net down for you. The service was top knotch and the little touches here and there did not go unoticedBath area. The bath area is very nice. We had two sinks and mirrors to allow for our own space. We bathed in each of the shower areas the outdoor dual showers were our favorite. We also loved the bath tub and the bath salts provided. It was such a calming atmosphere in the bathing area. Villa overall They have a mini bar packed with whatever you may need. On our first day they have delicious coconut water and some chocolates. They also had a great selection of hot teas that you could make in your room. Lemongrass was our favorite. They provided bug spray much needed. and aloe which is also another thoughtful touch. The closet space was very plentiful and the robes were nice toExcursions We did 2 longtail boat adventures. Yes it is quite pricey but we had the best time. Lee was our tour guide on our first day. We LOVED Lee. Lee had such great expertise of the islands and we had so much fun. Our first day of boats We went to Hong Island lagon we were the first people to be in there and it was so serene and beautiful. Shortly after we had a few minutes of privacy lots of other boats appeared. We went to several other islands throughout the day which were all just so beautiful. We went to one island with lots of monkeys and we fed them fruit. That was too much fun to watch the monkeys play and swim for the fruit. Another day we did a long tail boat where we went to Koh Nok then over to the point of Koh Yao Yai. Again we had privacy for some time before other tourists started appearing later in the day. Our long tail boat operator was super friendly and very flexible in our wishesWe did a Chefs Table meal with Chef Ton our second night there. My husband loves cooking so we really enjoyed watching Chef cook each meal. We were so FULL we had so much great food. Chef Ton was very nice and personable. Dao was our server for that night and we also loved her. We continued to see her throughout our stay and she always made a point to great us and ask how we are doing. We did a cooking class with Chef Kwan and that was also another great experience. She walked us around the gardens on the property where we got our own peppers and herbs for our cooking class. We really enjoyed learning how to cook some traditional thai mealsWe did the Hilltop Reserve BQ one night. Chef Walter was the grilmaster for the evening. He made us a special seafood platter which was AMAZINGChicken farm. Make sure you go visit the chicken farm what a cool experience. We took a buggy over there and able to walk into the chicken coop and pick our own eggs. The eggs are so godThey provided us with a private villa dinner on our last night stay as apart of our honeymoon package. It was nice to enjoy our last dinner in the villa and they give you alot of meal options to choose fromHiltop Reserve Cocktail Night This was so much fun and we got to meet more of the staff and enjoy some new cocktails. Would highly recommend doing thisSpa. Oh man. The NICEST spa treatment I have ever had. The spa is absolutely beautiful. We did a half day package which included 30 mins in the private sauna steam area. Then we had a coconut body scrub then a 90 minute massage then a 60 minute silk facial. It was incredibleService. This place has infinity out of 100 stars for service. Ben GEM was so amazing. He made us smile each time we saw him. Our next destination was Chiang Mai Ben being from Chiang Mai wrote up recommendations to share with us. He did not have to do that which just shows how above and beyond Six Senses goes to make you feel welcome. He made sure we always had what we needed. We wanted to try some local food of the island and he helped coordinate a taxi and a restaurant for us to try. The people working all over the resort are so nice I wish I could remember all of their names. The staff in the living room were always so friendly Pla especially. We loved seeing Pla every morning. Breakfast. The Breakfast is delicious. Make sure you go into the deli chamber area and have some of their Green Juice. I miss it so much. Their coffee was always so delicious. We loved trying the different Thai egg dishes each morning. Beach. We had just come from Phi Phi Island so we got great exposure to beautiful beaches there. We also did 2 days of longtail boat. The beach at Six Senses was not spectacular by any means BUT we loved our villa and spent most of our free time thereResorts care for the environment and community One big reason you should look at a Six Senses is for how they treat our world and their community. About a third of Yao Nois staff is locals from the island. They do their best not to use plastic hence the glass bottles for still water and the lemongrass straws. They have a good practice of sending recycled items back to their vendors and suppliers. They have a water waste facility on site. You can tell they want to make an impact in our world and that was a huge plus for us during our stayLastly I just want to mention how nice the longtail and speedboats are compared to some others. The comfort and quality of the boats are much nicer. They have comfortable cushions nice big towels and a cooler full of bottled water and fruitI am missing this resort so bad hence why I am writing my review today. We loved Six Senses and we will be trying another one of their resorts for a future anniversary.

We visited six senses on the final leg on our having stayed at Jaya house in Cambodia the St Regis in Bangkok and Villa Mahabhirom in Chiang Mai. In all our prior hotels we had a 5 star experience. Perhaps it \u2019s easier to have a 5 star experience in a more boutique hotel or a hotel confined to a single building. Six Senses is an extremely large property taking 11 years to build and on a mountainous peak no less. It \u2019s very impressive how they were able to do this. The hotel is more of a rustic luxury. The finishes are n\u2019t white and sleek amidst a green background but more of a jungle feel. That being said our accommodations were very nice. We had a private pool we did n\u2019t use but it was nice to have. The villa was spacious and you were not short on in room amenities. I wo n\u2019t bore you with the issues we had when we were there at least the ones that pertained to our personal trip because that will likely not happen to you but I \u2019l give a short list of the pros and cons. Positives Fantastic food and multiple dining options. Extremely well done even for New York snobs. Dining prices were fairly priced Unbeatable main pool panoramic view. Maybe the best in the world. Excellent Housekeeping and in room dining service Responsive guest service we were comped a free dinner due to some early mistepGod amount of amenities and activities if you wish to spend time on the property Pretty groundsFantastic daily excursion to the north and south islands with our guide Luke i d recommend doing both as there \u2019s a lot to see from monkeys to lagoons to bats to snorkeling. Nice amenity having a GEM personal guest experience manager. They try and succeed usually to be helpful. Negatives While it \u2019s an oceanfront resort it \u2019s not a beach resort. They need to do a better job of attracting people to the beach especially because there \u2019s not enough room at the pool. The problem is that they do n\u2019t efficiently clean the beach as it \u2019s littered with lighters and garbage I wo n\u2019t post the pic I took but trust me it \u2019s there. There \u2019s also jellyfish which they ca n\u2019t control so not their fault. They \u2019ve said in prior responses that they clean it multiple times daily but they do not. There should be one person or a team to clean the beach. They have a lot of staff some standing around a bunch. There are also no chairs set up on either beach they have so it is n\u2019t inviting at all to go there. The main pool the one you come here for does n\u2019t open until 10am. That \u2019s inexcusable because that hilltop view is what your paying close to 150 a night for. Who ever heard of a pool at a tropical resort opening at 10. I \u2019m not sure how they justify that. That needs to be changed immediately. Also there are very limited pool seats. When we arrived we had to go to the beach because they could n\u2019t accommodate us at the pool at least on pool chairs. We \u2019re not an old crotchety couple but we were here on our honeymoon and it was mostly families with lots of kids. They were all pretty much well behaved but it does take away from the honeymoon vibe if you \u2019re looking for one. The place is so spread out that they have buggies take you everywhere. They \u2019re very responsive but it is a bit annoying having to make a call every time you want to go somewhere. Otherwise you can walk but it \u2019s very hilly. If You \u2019re traveling on your honeymoon I \u2019d recommend 3 days max here we were not able to do a phi phi islands trip which we would have done. It has everything in place to be a 5 star resort but it \u2019s not quite there yet but you \u2019l certainly have a great time.", "offset": [2595, 2655], "date": "2019-01-03 00:00:00", "cpt": "3", "category": "pool"}, {"id": 18, "uid": "efad5015-7ca5-4e25-b1a9-e3d6752be5e9", "sentence": "A wonderful tranquil location with stunning views.

Six Senses founder sold the business to Pegasus Capital an American Private Equity firm in 2012.

Let me premise by saying that we have stayed at Six Senses in the Maldives which was lovely and well worth the expense but unfortunately I can not say the same for Six Senses Yao Noi. Room We were room 47 an ocean pool villa. The room had a great view of the karsts. However the amount of gecko and animal feces and dead bugs detracted from the view because you were not able to sit in any of the outdoor areas. We understand this is outdoor eco friendly resort but the simple solution is for the cleaning staff to clean up when we go down for meals or are out of the room. We felt the cleaning staff was very poor and not attentive. Another example of the lack of attention and this may seem petty but we had expect the room attendant to figure out that we only wanted cold still water. However they kept bringing sparking and did not keep it chilled in the refrigerator. There were other little things that you would expect especially paying 1000 a night something that would set you apart from a Holiday Inn. Dining. we got the full board meal plan and would not recommend it. If anything do the the half board. If you are looking for 5star food Six Senses underperforms. One issue we had was a bug and gecko infested dinner at the Living Room. This was due to the table top light which attracted bugs which attracted geckos. Again this is an outdoor eco friendly resort but this is a little more than distracting when trying to enjoy your meal. A simple solution is to use more over head lights rather than table top to reduce unwanted dinner guests. Amenities one big disappointing item is the fact that the pool does not open until 11 am. The common pool has the best views especially for sunrises but you had never know because it is closed. Again at this price you had expect to be able to use these amenities during reasonable hours. Despite the view the pool itself is aging and could use a refresh. Excursions. We tried to book a shared excursion to Phi Phi Islands but we were told this was not a possibility because not enough people had signed up and they wanted to force us into their private charter. This is disappointing because you had expect better customer service for example possibly a discounted private charter. Instead we left the resort disappointed because we never saw the Phi Phi Islands and all it needed was some flexibility by Six Senses which was never offered. Overall the views are extraordinary but that is all this resort has to offer. To put things in perspective the Princess of Thailand visited Yao Noi while we were there but she stayed at an adjacent property.", "offset": [1669, 1772], "date": "2019-06-30 00:00:00", "cpt": "4", "category": "pool"}, {"id": 22, "uid": "a7ae90b6-c1aa-471d-8a8f-622519f3b503", "sentence": "An amazing holiday from start to finish.

After all we are not experts in running a hotelInvestment Generally it felt like the hotel needed a little more investment. For the price I believe you need to ensure that nothing is shabby even if shabby chic is the aim. Our villa 50 for example. The decking is so faded that it just looks old not chic. The gate lock needs replacing the bath plug does not work and I do not know when it was last used. The Bose system suggests state of the art but you can only connect using a headphone port which modern iphones do not have. The layout is also rather odd walking through the hall to get to the bathroom from the bedroom and there are not enough drawers or storage areas for your clothes. The fencing by the pool has gaps in it such that people on the road can see in and you can look out over what feels like a bit of a wasteland. Take a trip down to the Living Room and look at the plastic rain shields hanging down on the beach side of the restaurant. most are ripped so badly I can not believe they shield anything. And they look appalling. These should be changed well before the state they are in today. These are small points but in aggregate left us with a sense that perhaps the best days of the resort are behind it and that cash is needed rather urgently. When you look at the quality of the finishing at some of the maldive resorts or say The Datai in Langkawi everything is attended to. Attention As I say overall service was stand out and the people in your team are fantastic. However there are gaps in the general attention at the hotel. The beach for example is not good. The layout is very odd and the area back from the beach in front of the screen feels more like a car park than a beach. It gets covered in tracks from the seemingly endless buggys that visit during the day. No one rakes the beach no one rakes the car park and on three different occasions I went to get our own water from within the Coco Club having waited more than 30 minutes for someone to come over only to find no one is there. The beach furniture is tired and old and needs fixing and certainly cleaning. There are 4 chairs and a table by the palm tree at the top of the stairs which are plain dirty. The sand comes half way up the legs presumably from being left out in a high tide and no one has thought to clean them down. That area looks awful too. Food Generally this was good but I am afraid it is not a patch on other top end resorts. I think you need a major review of your menus the variety available and the quality of cookery. Breakfast was the exception which is fantastic great variety and service as usual. But thai food curries and sushi should be first class and more varied. The menu should be different at each location but we felt like we were ultimately choosing the same food wherever we went. We stayed at the Phum Baitong in Cambodia before we arrived at the Six Senses and the food there was exquisite. Every part of it. At every Aman resort we have stayed at the food has been better at the Datai it is world class. Even at the Rosewood in Phnom Penh it was better than anything we ate at Six Senses. Facilities. Perhaps our biggest gripe though remains the facilities. you have one pool with stunning views but then you do not open it before 11 am and seem to close it most nights for a couples dinner. I can not fathom this. In the morning people crowd the car park beach wanting to sunbath and cool off in some water and the only option is a pool at their villa lovely to have but not everyones idea of where to spend lots of time or the sea. The pool upstairs should be open 24 hours or if not you should build a new one down between the living room and the beach. That facility should be much much better anyway make something of the coco bar make more of that space serve beach snacks better etc. I really think you should not be able to book out key facilities for yourself. So those private dinners should not be available unles in a different location designed for that purpose. GEM. Our gem Nim was delightful and our comments here are not about her specifically but about the approach. Perhaps some guests are used to having their own butlers and demand all sorts of things from their gem constantly. But we are not like that. we are quite self sufficient we want to go to the spa and book our own treatments we want to sit with the excursion team to plan a trip and we want to go to restaurants to look at menus and make a choice of what to book and when. Nim seemed to us to be worried and almost sad throughout our trip because we were not using her very much. I do not know whether compensation for the Gems is linked to use or tips and I really hope it is not because that would motivate the wrong behaviour. In practice though you should be asked whether you want a Gem or not. And you should be asked how you want to engage with the resort more generally. On arrival for example you are whisked around the resort without a map and just feel rushed and disorientated by the end of it. Arriving at the pool fully dressed hot and sweaty from your trip and walking around looking at the space and the people lying in it is odd to say the least. We were nt even offered a toilet stop. We should have been asked what we wanted to do and our answer would have been to get to our room settle in and then explore later. One idea that came to mind was to make more of a pre stay survey to ascertain the style of support guests want. I also think people are used to using their phones and aps now and I would encourage you to develop your own resort ap that you download before or after you arrive. You could have a map book meals spa sessions and trips order room service even have an indicator about the busyness of the beach or pool so you do not trundle up the hill to find there is no room another gripe about the facilitiesAs I say we just want to be constructive here and these are our own thoughts based on the various other first class resorts we have stayed at.

In particular the service was first class throughout from our GEM to the bar staff waiters and waitresses boat teams and beyond. The setting is also of course utterly beguiling and unique. What I am writing here though are observations of ours based entirely on hoping that they prove helpful but also they are only our views and we understand that others may not feel the same way and that you may ultimately not want to take these on board. After all we are not experts in running a hotelInvestment Generally it felt like the hotel needed a little more investment. For the price I believe you need to ensure that nothing is shabby even if shabby chic is the aim. Our villa 50 for example. The decking is so faded that it just looks old not chic. The gate lock needs replacing the bath plug does not work and I do not know when it was last used. The Bose system suggests state of the art but you can only connect using a headphone port which modern iphones do not have. The layout is also rather odd walking through the hall to get to the bathroom from the bedroom and there are not enough drawers or storage areas for your clothes. The fencing by the pool has gaps in it such that people on the road can see in and you can look out over what feels like a bit of a wasteland. Take a trip down to the Living Room and look at the plastic rain shields hanging down on the beach side of the restaurant. most are ripped so badly I can not believe they shield anything. And they look appalling. These should be changed well before the state they are in today. These are small points but in aggregate left us with a sense that perhaps the best days of the resort are behind it and that cash is needed rather urgently. When you look at the quality of the finishing at some of the maldive resorts or say The Datai in Langkawi everything is attended to. Attention As I say overall service was stand out and the people in your team are fantastic. However there are gaps in the general attention at the hotel. The beach for example is not good. The layout is very odd and the area back from the beach in front of the screen feels more like a car park than a beach. It gets covered in tracks from the seemingly endless buggys that visit during the day. No one rakes the beach no one rakes the car park and on three different occasions I went to get our own water from within the Coco Club having waited more than 30 minutes for someone to come over only to find no one is there. The beach furniture is tired and old and needs fixing and certainly cleaning. There are 4 chairs and a table by the palm tree at the top of the stairs which are plain dirty. The sand comes half way up the legs presumably from being left out in a high tide and no one has thought to clean them down. That area looks awful too. Food Generally this was good but I am afraid it is not a patch on other top end resorts. I think you need a major review of your menus the variety available and the quality of cookery. Breakfast was the exception which is fantastic great variety and service as usual. But thai food curries and sushi should be first class and more varied. The menu should be different at each location but we felt like we were ultimately choosing the same food wherever we went. We stayed at the Phum Baitong in Cambodia before we arrived at the Six Senses and the food there was exquisite. Every part of it. At every Aman resort we have stayed at the food has been better at the Datai it is world class. Even at the Rosewood in Phnom Penh it was better than anything we ate at Six Senses. Facilities. Perhaps our biggest gripe though remains the facilities. you have one pool with stunning views but then you do not open it before 11 am and seem to close it most nights for a couples dinner. I can not fathom this. In the morning people crowd the car park beach wanting to sunbath and cool off in some water and the only option is a pool at their villa lovely to have but not everyones idea of where to spend lots of time or the sea. The pool upstairs should be open 24 hours or if not you should build a new one down between the living room and the beach. That facility should be much much better anyway make something of the coco bar make more of that space serve beach snacks better etc. I really think you should not be able to book out key facilities for yourself. So those private dinners should not be available unles in a different location designed for that purpose. GEM. Our gem Nim was delightful and our comments here are not about her specifically but about the approach. Perhaps some guests are used to having their own butlers and demand all sorts of things from their gem constantly. But we are not like that. we are quite self sufficient we want to go to the spa and book our own treatments we want to sit with the excursion team to plan a trip and we want to go to restaurants to look at menus and make a choice of what to book and when. Nim seemed to us to be worried and almost sad throughout our trip because we were not using her very much. I do not know whether compensation for the Gems is linked to use or tips and I really hope it is not because that would motivate the wrong behaviour. In practice though you should be asked whether you want a Gem or not. And you should be asked how you want to engage with the resort more generally. On arrival for example you are whisked around the resort without a map and just feel rushed and disorientated by the end of it. Arriving at the pool fully dressed hot and sweaty from your trip and walking around looking at the space and the people lying in it is odd to say the least. We were nt even offered a toilet stop. We should have been asked what we wanted to do and our answer would have been to get to our room settle in and then explore later. One idea that came to mind was to make more of a pre stay survey to ascertain the style of support guests want. I also think people are used to using their phones and aps now and I would encourage you to develop your own resort ap that you download before or after you arrive.

We stayed with our young daughter 20 months and some family members 7 in total. We were extremely impressed with the level of service and genuine kindness of the staff. Clement the head of operations and his team were deeply involved to ensure our stay was the most enjoyable possible. Every villa has its own GEM guest experience maker to make sure guests have undivided attention during their stay. Taptim our GEM went out of her way to provide an exceptional individualised service she organised a nice birthday for my wife for example and she was always available for us. We stayed in the four bedroom hideaway villa which is quiet surrounded by beautiful nature and allowed us all as a family to stay together. For couples we would recommend a sea view villa if available as the view is just incredible. The resort is beautiful and sits in the middle of the forest. It does n\u2019t have the most beautiful beach but the swimming pool on top of the hill probably has the most stunning view you could find in Thailand. You can also rent a boat for the day to visit surrounding islands like Kho Phi Phi where the beach is more beautiful.", "offset": [888, 1034], "date": "2019-12-16 00:00:00", "cpt": "4", "category": "pool"}]}
