Elevators are extremely slow and very small we waited about 15 20minutes to get down from 14th floor. Would have taken stairs but wife is 8 months pregnant. I was told I was booked and payed for club level floor when arrived they were full. When I went to my room and it was bathtub less went back to front desk and a room appeared on the club level floor that I payed for but still not bathtub.
