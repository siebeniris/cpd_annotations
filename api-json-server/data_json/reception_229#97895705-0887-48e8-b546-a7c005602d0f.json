My husband and I have been to many beautiful resorts and this one takes the cake. The surroundings are magical. You feel a world away from it all. The spa is beyond anything you can imagine with impeccable service. The resort has multiple pools that are just steps from the ocean so you are able to listen to the waves or go for a walk on the beach without having to move your things. The rooms are pristine with every attention to detail. We were on the 1st level and had our own dip pool right outside and then a short walk to the beach. there is an outdoor shower which was used often and a huge tub. The beds are so comfortable and plush. The architecture of the entire resort is gorgeous and so intriguing. You must go to the website and read the history. This is the place to go if you really need to relax de stress and do nothing.

We just returned home last night from a six day stay at Dorado Beach Ritz Reserve. When traveling we usually choose Four Seasons Resorts or Rosewood mainly for level of service and ambiance. Having said that we were both impressed with this property. This is the perfect place to get away as a couple. The property and grounds are breathtaking. The beach is beautiful. All of the rooms are beautiful and ocean front. We stayed in a gorgeous second floor room with balcony and amazing views loved the outdoor shower farther away from the main building and it was quiet and very private most days we did not see anyone. Although some reviews say this resort is kid friendly we did not see one child during our stay and overall seems to be a better fit for couples. When researching this property prior to booking some of the reviews recommend the east side for more privacy and initially that is what we booked. Upon our arrival we were told there was availability on the west side if we would prefer to switch. Well we were glad we did. The east side is very pretty but no real beach access or lounge chairs or service. The west side beach is nicer and more accessible to everything without losing that private feel. We had dinner at Mi Casa Encanto and Zafra which is located a few min away by the golf course. all three of the restaurants were all fabulous. We ordered lunch service on the beach from Positivo each day. The food and the service at the resort overall is fantastic. The staff goes out of their way from the moment you arrive to the moment you leave to make sure you are happy and all your needs are met. We golfed at the Sugar Cane and East course. East course is along the ocean with breathtaking views. My husband and I both had massages at The spa let me tell you this is probably one of the most beautiful spas in the world I wish I had words to describe it but there are no words that will do it justice. It is an experience you should not miss if you visit this property. If you are looking for a private tranquil getaway to relax and be pampered with excellent service and amenities and are NOT looking for nightlife and crowds this is the place to go. The only one minor issue I can think of is if important to anyone at all the internet WiFi service could use an upgrade but I am sure that is something that they are working on. If you are looking for typical or average go elsewhere. This is not you are typical hotel resort. Is it pricey. Some may say. but you get what you pay for. do not complain about the price you already know the price when your booking. If you are considering booking a trip here do not let the few negative reviews discourage you. Although there are very FEW negative reviews it is unfortunate that some of those reviewers missed out on the wonderful experience that this resort truly is. This is one place we will be sure to revisit.", "offset": [1054, 1136], "date": "2015-03-01", "cpt": "0", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 4, "uid": "d13bcb5a-a491-4bdc-b13c-14f194299fce", "sentence": "Ridiculously overpriced for the level of service. You might assume that spending over 20 per night for a standard room would guarantee a 5star service experience. Please do not make such an assumption with this resort. For 2030 per night you get access to a beautiful beach. Nothing more. Calling the concierge \u2013 minimum of 5 10 rings each time with several times no answer. Reserving restaurant times \u2013 plan on the wrong restaurant long wait times and mediocre food. In room dining \u2013 plan on the wrong order missing items and long wait times. Waiting for bell service \u2013 expect 20 30 minutes past the stated time. Turn down and daily service \u2013 expect the most inconvenient times or not at all. Activities concierge \u2013 passes off his responsibility for scheduling activities to third party vendors and makes you deal directly with them. I did not come on vacation to do the job of the concierge. Sorry. Traditionally as a big fan of the Ritz this resort is more or less heart breaking. To see their reserve model up close I can summarize it as this 5 times the price but worse service than you would find at any standard Ritz throughout the world. I am not a novice traveler mind you. I stayed over 90 days at Ritz properties alone last year. I will definitely not be returning to the Ritz Reserve in Dorado. There are at least 10 other places on the tip of my tongue where I would send friends family associates employees and clients. For the sake of the brand I do hope they fix the critical service issues they have at this resort and elsewhere. Each trip each year I have found myself staying more and more frequently at the Four Seasons or St Regis and not the Ritz.

My wife and I stayed at the resort April 5th9th and had a great experience. Of course when visiting any resort there were a few bumps along the way. We had reserved transportation from the airport to the resort directly with the hotel however when we got to the airport and got our luggage there was no one from the resort to pick us up so we got a cab which was a cost of 66 30 35 minute ride depending on traffic. If you do book transfers directly with hotel it will cost of 125 each way. Once we got to the resort and I expressed my disappointment they paid for the 66 ride and apologized. Word of warning that the check in time is 4 pm so if you arrive earlier than that chances are your room will not be ready such as ours was but we sat at the Postivo Bar and had a few drinks which were not charged for do to the long wait for our room but rest of the check in process went smoothly thanks to Jenifer. The room itself was great very spacious with our own plunge pool which was just steps from the beach. The room as has a mini bar which is stocked with snacks but if you eat you pay extra for whatever item it was. The bathroom was very spacious with an indoor and outdoor shower. For me the outdoor shower was great since the indoor shower was extremely difficult to figure out. For me the AC never got the room cool enough but does have a ceiling fan which was great. Also every time you open the patio door the AC automatically shuts off so you might want to make sure that you close it either entering or leaving. Plunge pool was really nice and well maintained as was the lush landscaping. To get around there are bicycles which you can rent or do what we did which was to get our EMBAJADOR Ambassador Butler to have us picked in a golf cart when going to dinner or to the pool since we were in building 1 and far from both. We ate at all the restaurants and food was really good but it is recommended that you make reservations. There are dress codes for certain restaurants such as Mi Casa so I adhered to this wearing nice slacks and a collared shirt and was probably the most overdressed person there. At each the staff was very nice however at times service was a little slow but the excellent food more than made up it. We had a Cabana for one day at he main pool which was great and the service as well. There is an up charge but well worth it. For a couple of days we had reserved beach chairs and umbrella on the beach just steps from our room which was great. Service at times was a little slow but the personalities of the staff was excellent. In their defense the beach is very long and they do a lot of back and forth. Here are a few of the staff members that made our experience really great and their dedication to excellent customer service really showed. Antonio EMBAJADORMichael EMBAJADORJeniferEMBAJADORNoel EMBAJADORHousekeping Staff ZulmaryAl had a great personality and seemed to really enjoy what they do which my wife and I very much appreciated. We were not at all disappointed and the resort met our expectations although some of the other reviews we read where not of the same opinion. Our customer service experience was really good which is what you would expect from a Ritz Carlton. This was our first visit to the resort but certainly will not be our last.

Service Not So Much. The Ritz Carlton Reserve in Dorado Beach is one of the prettiest places we have ever stayed. The gardens are gorgeous and the architecture of the hotel is beautiful. Our room the pool and the beach were all spectacular. Food was very good to great. Mi Casa is a must for dinner. We had a morning butler and an evening butler and both were very friendly and helpful. However we had a number of service issues one would not expect at a Ritz Carlton. It started at check in. We expected a room to be ready by 30 as that is standard check in time at most hotels. Upon arrival we were told check in was at 40 but our room should be ready shortly. It was not ready until 530At check in we also requested bicycles for our stay and we were told that they would be delivered to our room by that evening. The next morning the bicycles still had not arrived. We called our day butler and when we returned back from the beach late that afternoon the bikes had finally been delivered almost a full day later than we expected to receive them. My husband sent three shirts out to be laundered on our second day there. On our last day two days later he realized they had yet to return. After a few phone calls he was told they had found his shirts but they had never been cleaned. They returned them to our room packaged as if they had been cleaned with a simple apology. Service at breakfast was fine on some mornings but confused and very slow on other mornings. At one breakfast we waited nearly twenty minutes for a server. We then had two servers approach us separately to ask for our coffee order which took another ten minutes to arrive. My daughter ordered lemonade for breakfast and after our food arrived she was told by yet another server that they do not serve lemonade. Would have been nice to have been told that when her order was placed. We went to the water park on our last day which is small but very nice and fun. As instructed we asked the attendant at the water park to call for a golf cart when we were ready to return to the hotel. More than thirty minutes after doing so the golf cart finally arrived. We shared the ride with a family who had been waiting for transportation back to the hotel longer than we were. Any of these inconveniences alone could easily be overlooked as glitches do happen. In fact on vacation we consider ourselves pretty laid back and certainly we are not looking to criticize the efforts of the staff at any hotel. However in this instance there was a pattern of service issues as we encountered a problem with service every day. Given that this is a Reserve property of Ritz Carlton one expects flawless service. As other reviewers seem to have encountered similar issues I strongly suggest Ritz tighten things up in Dorado or else risk valuable return customers and referrals.", "offset": [2494, 2608], "date": "2015-04-11", "cpt": "0", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 7, "uid": "1cd90c12-bc7c-4b7e-ba7f-c44cbdf2cc2e", "sentence": "Just beautiful.

The resort blends beautifully with nature and really transports you to a tropical paradise. The service and attention to detail are on point the food and beverage service was slow on both visits but we were also on island time and not too worried about it. I only wish the coffee bar was open. It was closed during our entire stay and it frequently took over 45 minutes for room service to deliver it to our room.

My wife and I just returned from a 5 day trip at the reserve. All in all I would say that this is one of the nicest resorts we have ever stayed at and always felt that we were some of the only guests at the resort. We stayed in an east beach ocean reserve room 621 which is on the second floor and is the closest building to reception. The room was huge and beautiful. We stayed on the property the entire time except for one trip to a food tour in old San Juan which was a lot of fun. We also took advantage of everything that was offered at the resort. SPA. Absolutely beautiful the architecture is just fantastic. The nicest spa I have ever attended. I had an Ebb and Flow massage and would highly recommend it after I hung out in the steam bath the hot tub and the plunge pool. All very refreshing and again I only saw a couple of other guests. My wife had a Manicure and Pedicure and felt at 1 hour each it was bit long but she enjoyed it and the ladies side hot tub as well. The Watermil. We road bikes to get there and took the long way around the Nature trail which was a lot of fun. The Watermil has a Lazy river a couple of slides and some activities. It would be nice if you had kids but we did everything in about an hour and wanted to go back to the resort. The food was good but I can not say it was beyond exceptional either. We had breakfast everyday at Mi Casa and also had dinner there once. The service at the restaurants ranged from excellent to just okay have to ask for coffee plate came out with the wrong sides had to ask more than once for tabasco etc. But the hostesses and dinner service was exceptional. I would say that the yogurt at breakfast is the best yogurt I have ever had. If you like yogurt I would suggest giving it a shot. We also had dinner at Encanto and lunch at Positivo and had dinner at a July 4th beach party which were all good. We attended a Culinary class at La Cocina with Chef Rory. It was about 3 hours long and had a good time. I would certainly recommend it. It was only my wife and I think it would have been canceled but we had 2 no shows and it was already a go. I would find out about this ahead of time and get signed up. So Why not 5 starsWel every room has an ambassador assigned to them to get things done. Over our 5 day stay we had 3 different Ambassadors. The only way we knew this was to call the front desk and ask how to get in touch with them. Our first guy was showing us around our room and got to the TV where you have all the maps your folio etc. and it did not work. he left to call maintenance but never returned to finish. Maintenance came and rebooted the system and it worked for about an hour and then stopped working again. We had a new Ambassador the next day and only found out because I called to ask why no one picked up when I pressed the Ambassador button on the phone to ask to have our TV looked at and to change out our coffee pot which did not work well it over flowed. It turns out the button on the phone dials the Ambassadors of the Environment not your Ambassador. The front desk gave me our new guys cell phone who I called and left a VM he called back promptly and had the batteries replaced in the remote the TV worked fine from that point on. However he did not have our coffee pot replaced or left a french press as an alternative as requested. The Coffee pot over flowed our last day as well so I believe it was never looked at. The cleaning service does not leave ice which I find odd and you have to get your Ambassador to fill it. I found our second Ambassador outside of our room and asked if there was an ice machine so I could just fill it myself. He said he would bring it everyday and asked what time. We said 10 and 4 and it was filled the first day as requested. But the next day our second Ambassador introduced us to our new third Ambassador who said he would fill the ice every day at 10 and 4 without being asked Okay then. this is what I expect from the Ritz but after his first day we only got ice if I saw him and asked. He always had an excuse. I ordered it etc. The last straw with the Ambassadors came on our last day. I had requested a late checkout which reception gladly extended to 2 pm and our Ambassador asked what time we wanted our luggage picked up. I am thinking 5 minutes until 2 but he suggests 1 pm which kind of defeats the late check out. I suggest 130 which he agrees to. At 150 and a no show Ambassador or Bell man I took the luggage down myself. I could have called but I was a little aggravated now and I really do not mind doing it myself. But If you say you are going to do something at a specific time I expect that to happen. The ambassador thing just did not work well for me. Maybe I missed something but if you have a staff change the new guy should come and introduce themselves and give you a way to contact them and then follow through on the requests or at a minimum close the loop. It just did not happen. The other negative was that they had the pool near our room closed for maintenance on Sunday until we left. I am not sure when they reopened it. Why on earth would you close a pool on a weekend during the day. I know there is a second pool but this one was close to us and where we hung out. We asked the staff when it would reopen but they had no idea. We just stayed on the beach but the pool is very nice to cool off in and a big part of your day. For the most part the resort is top notch and I will try other reserves but I do not believe we will return to this one. One suggestion. sign up for your bikes early and you will have them you whole trip. It is a fun way to get around a big resort.

We stayed at the Dorado Beach hotel in early July with our two elementary aged kids. Our stay was nothing short of AMAZING. We travel a few times a year and stay at four and five star resorts typically at the beach. We were all blown away by this top notch resort. We stayed at the Ritz Carlton San Juan immediately prior to this resort and it took us 45 minutes by car to arrive. Our experience began the moment the staff helped us out of the SUV and served us fruit Popsicles. We walked up the steps to the outdoor lobby and the view was as close to perfect as it gets. I am glad my husband was able to check us in because I was literally speechless. I just could not stop staring out at the pool and ocean. It is such a beautifully designed hotel. There is an understated 1950s vibe but everything manages to incorporate the natural beauty of the Puerto Rican environment. it is luxurious but also very intimate and natural. We arrived around noon and our room was not ready but they offered us an upgraded room so we could get into it a little sooner and we were escorted to the Positivo Sand Bar. Drop dead gorgeous with a sand floor. We were impressed by the delicious cocktails and food. Their cocktail lists are different and equally impressive at all of the resorts restaurants. I did not have a drink I did not love the whole stay. Food was equally impressive and plenty of healthy options that kept me happy. The room was nothing short of amazing. Looks even better in person than in the pictures if that is possible. Plenty large for a family of four. The outdoor shower was our favorite part of the room but the tub was also pretty amazing. The view was postcard perfect. Beds were very comfortable and linens were white soft and clean. I love the full size amenities that they refill. The smells were relaxing and spa like and made me think they really are being good stewards of the environment. The natural beauty and luxury of this resort are impressive but the STAFF are really what makes this place the perfect getaway. They were so genuinely friendly and actively searched for ways to make our stay better. Everyone remembered our names our housekeeper Jenifer even remembered both of kids first names. And she asked daily what else she could do to make us more comfortable. Roberto served us so well at Positivo and Polside. He seemed to anticipate our needs. Luz was equally amazing. She helped us make reservations and set up activities for the kids. She even escorted our son home one evening after his Ambassadors Activity. This place has an abundance of staff but it never felt intrusive. Whatever they are doing for hiring and training is working superbly. I really am hard pressed to find anything negative to write about this place. The prices are high but in this case you really do get what you pay for and more. This hotel is what I will forever compare every other beach experience to and I fear I may never find another place that surpasses the level of service and luxury I experienced at Dorado Beach.", "offset": [2521, 2595], "date": "2015-07-16", "cpt": "1", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 12, "uid": "96eea63f-ea02-4f69-9bb3-3db2dbda9013", "sentence": "Peaceful extraordinary top notch.

First time in Puerto Rico which to me seems like all the nice bits of the Caribbean mixed in with American convenience which is great if you have not been think great weather lovely people but actual roads facilitiesWe stayed in the east beach plunge pool room primarily because it was a couple of hundred bucks less than the west beach rooms but do not be fooled by the names all of these rooms are on the North beach as the hotel is on the north short of Puerto Rico and so there is zero possibility of seeing the sunrise sunset over the water. The east beach is essentially the eastern end of the resort and is very rocky so while you could swim in it you probably will not want to. The west beach is very nice but manmade including a big breakwater wall. and so does not really have that traditional beachy feel to it. It is private though which is nice. My advice stick with the east beach. Its closer to the gym and you can save yourself A LOT by skipping the west beach its about a 5 minute walk from the east romsThe rooms are top class typical Ritz Carlton. I will not go into detail as the pictures other reviews detail them. The hotel is extremely expensive. In January our rate was 850 night with no breakfast. On top of this you have breakfast which runs 50 70 a day for two of you. Very expensive though in fairness its probably the best hotel breakfast I have ever eaten. Pancake with maple syrup air were a highlight. You also have to add on the resort fee 95 night which provides bikes and water sports equipment. Its not optional so should be included in the advertised rate so I am docking points for that. Add on taxes also Puerto Rico going through financial crisis and have hiked hotel taxesThe restaurants in the hotel are some of the best I have ever been at in a hotel. Positivo in particular. Fantastic. So my gripes are as follows. Transportation only option the hotel really presents to you are limo services which run about 175 for a 30 minute drive to a restaurant same to and from the airport. This adds up. I feel there should be a local taxi company or something that could provide a lower cost service. No uber in Puerto Rico so you are the mercy of these car companies. The service is good but I do not need to be picked up in a Navigator when there is just 2 of us. Its unnecessary and not very fuel efficient. Concierge. I think it was his first week but he really did not appear to know what he was at. We asked them to rent us a car it took about 3 phone calls to organise it with them we were told it was a Mustang 175 a day fine I just wanted a car gave a scan of credit card and were told they would pick us up to do the paperwork at 9 am the next day. No one showed. Eventually the concierge called them they said they had a jeep wrangler but could not come get us until 3 pm. So we said no go. The concierge then called a local company Dias and got us a 5 minute cab ride down to them whereby we were given a brand new Ford Fusion for 60 bucks. Which was great. My question is why the Concierge did not call the local guys in the first place. We asked about scuba diving and were told by the concierge that we had to go 2 hours to either the east or west coast to do it. So we did not do it. The last day I find out that a member of staff in the hotel actually runs a dive shop in his spare time that is a full 5 minutes from the hotel. We lugged our dive gear from Europe. Otherwise service speed could for sure be improved. It was pretty good but for all in 120 a night I kind of expect to be waited on hand and foot and I do not feel that was the experiencedo not want to sound negative its an excellent hotel but at that price point excellent is the base line. The hotel can not be praised for being excellent. I would not go back but would recommend it to anyone who wants a slice of beachfront bliss coupled with their own personal financial crisis.", "offset": [1988, 2153], "date": "2016-01-18", "cpt": "1", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 15, "uid": "109cc656-2dfb-4b3c-8e48-c49f8e1bfbe3", "sentence": "Beautiful property with marginal service.

Pros. spectacular property beautifully landscaped Large beautifully appointed rooms with attention to small details. outlets lightsTwo separate pools with plenty of seating options Beautiful stretch of private beachCons Really terrible service. 1 rarely did the front desk answer the phone it once rang 32 times before I gave up and walked over to the desk. 2 wait staff at the two restaurants never seemed happy to be there and when asked simple questions is it possible to get one small change to a menu item or is it possible to have something to go after my meal. the answer was never yes but was always I will have to check with the chef. 3. Upon checking in we were told that the next morning we would meet our embajador who would give us a phone number to call if we needed anything. I am still waiting to meet him and I have been home over a week. 4 Housekeeping never serviced our room one day and when I called at 408pm was told that that service was discontinued for the day but that they would try to have an expanded turn down service made available. What. 5. The spa service was so bad that I actually complained to the spa manager who offered only to discount my service 10 even after I patiently and politely explained that the therapist had actually hurt me. 6. The groundskeepers were constantly driving around in diesel not electric golf carts which made walking the property unpleasant at best and one day it was actually dangerous as I was nearly run over by a staff person in a cart. Additionally the dining choices were severely limited and there was only one place to get coffee after 90 am and the coffees cost 59. All of which may seem like small things or that I must be especially demanding but the opposite is true. I am pretty easygoing as a traveler. it is just that when you consider that the rack rate at this property is 150 night and the average cost of food and beverage for a day is 200 for meals and incidental coffees etc. I expected a LOT better service. So for my money if you are looking for an upscale beach resort getaway go to the Four Seasons in Punta Mita.

The Ritz Carlton Reserve at Dorado is fabulous in every way. This was our first trip to this iconic location. We could not believe how magnificent the remodeling of the old Dorado Beach Resort turned out as we knew it was under construction for some time. The beach is gorgeous the rooms are large and beyond fabulous and the pools are incredible especially the one near the Positivo restaurant. It was without a doubt the most beautiful pool we have ever had the pleasure to swim in. It is huge and has benches along the sides that supply fabulous hydrotherapy there is even a hydrotherapy lounge chair large enough for 2 in the middle of the pool. What is also nice is that Encanto the family pool is further down on the beach. So this pool was not overrun with children while we were there. We played golf on the East Course which is a treat. so beautiful and with the help of the caddy which a guest must take a fun challenge to play. The food is outstanding at all 3 restaurants. Perhaps the best part of the hotel is the staff and service. We go to Caribbean resorts often and simply put this was the best service at the beach and pool anywhere. The young staff no one appears to be over 30 is there at your beck and call. They give you a little buzzer to use for anything you want from more towels to lunch to just even help with moving the loungers to stay in the shade throughout the day. We did not wait for more than a minute after pressing the buzzer for a beach hand to arrive at our chair and help us with our requests and always with a beautiful smile to go with it.

Thankfully TripAdvisor has never asked me to speak or breath for that matter so without spoken words or breath I am happy to write of my phenomenal experience at the Ritz Carlton Reserve Dorado Beach. To begin it is my belief that a vacation is an investment. An investment of your free time as well as your money. It is wise to do your research for such things and after multiple visits to this property I can tell you that this is one of the greatest vacation investments I have ever made. Here is why1. The service. At this beautiful possibly perfect setting it is hard to imagine their service and people as their 1 asset not the pristine beaches or lush jungle atmosphere. And then you meet the people and you witness their service and you know why they are 1. The service at this property is second to none. The people are kind and gracious and eager and amazingly so happy. It is obvious that the luxury Mariot brand treats their staff well and that treatment is then passed on to us while they resist the temptation of becoming annoyingly stuffy which some luxury resorts end up being. The staff genuinely wants you to enjoy your time with them and are all incredibly skilled in understanding your needs while seamlesly meeting them with a smile. I always say that we come to Puerto Rico but we always come back for the people. Well we came to Dorado but we will come back for the people. 2. The location. This setting is amazing. Morning to noon evening to night the views of this property will take your breath away. From strolling through the natural jungle setting to relaxing with your toes in the sand what Mother Nature once tried to take away Maria the Ritz has given back and with amazing gusto. Within the last year over 300 more plants have been planted here. After the hurricane the island of Puerto Rico needed its own plants so they had to get them from Costa Rica. I ca n\u2019t imagine Costa Rica has any plants now as this place is a jungle paradise. As for the beach it has everything one could dream of with soft sand turquoise water and easy waves. Long ago large rocks were placed far out in the surf to help make the \u201c bay \u201d of Dorado incredibly serene. I \u2019m not sure how they got those rocks out there without the help of God or a Maria but it makes for the perfect amount of ocean waves to swim in and just the right amount of ocean sounds to fall asleep to3. Couples families. While vacation investing this is a bigie. To be fair there are resorts in the world that cater to adults and there are resorts in the world that cater to children. Couples Resorts in Jamaica do a nice job at catering to adults only but there \u2019s something about all that \u201c free \u201d booze wine food. while Disney does a great job catering to children but there \u2019s something about all those kids. \u200d \u2640 \ufe0f. The Ritz Dorado focuses on guests of all walks and all ages of life. From a couple on a romantic getaway to a family looking for some quality downtime all together every need of every guest is anticipated even before arrival and constantly met after. The last time I visited this property I was a couple and they stopped at nothing to ensure our visit was romantic perfection. This time we had our 8 year old son with us and I was blown away at their level of family focus that I feel is incredibly difficult to pull off without appearing over the top kidish. My son took part in their Ambassadors of the Environment program and had a blast while exploring the nighttime jungle experimenting with nighttime sounds while finding the adorable frogs with the ambassador group. But to further my point his adventure ended at 9 while my husband and I were still enjoying dinner at Positivo. I texted our embajador Joshua that we were still at dinner so he insisted we stay and enjoy our meal as long as we liked picked our son up and then made fresh picked smoothies together in the chefs kitchen while our dinner ended. Everyone knew our sons name and asked about his day whenever we passed by. George the GM made sure he had his very own ambassador rash guard and dorado hat and while Zekiel and Jordan went out of their way on the beach to give our son boogie boarding tips we sat and enjoyed ourselves on the beach. That is how you cater to couples and families. 4. Money. When investing it often comes down to it. This is a luxury resort. You can find a lot of options that are far cheaper on the island and in the world but you will be missing out on all of the above as well as everything else. You wo n\u2019t get Karla who emails you your itinerary and dinner reservations a week before your arrival. You wo n\u2019t have management deliver you flowers and cake for your birthday. You wo n\u2019t get to spend a rainy afternoon with your son playing in your room \u2019s plunge pool while Jordan offers you afternoon guacamole and champagne as you read on your patio. You wo n\u2019t have a Joshua or a Jonathon or an Orlando tactfully meet your every need with a smile that makes you return their smile with a gracious hug. Here at the Ritz Reserve of Dorado you will spare no expense because they have spared no expense. That being said they do NOT nickel and dime you. You pay a hefty room cost but bottles of water are plentiful everywhere you look and free. Sunscreen and Evian facial spray are readily available and complimentary. Rides to and from the many resort amenities are quickly offered and at no cost. The waterpark is simply amazing with a jungle set lazy river and waterslides at no additional cost to note the waterpark is close enough for families to easily get to but far enough away that couples need never know it \u2019s even there. The bottom line is that never is there a time when you are paying a bill that you feel as if it is not worth it and that is quite an accomplishment on their part. You have accomplished a lot in your life why not let them show you theirs even if just for a week. Spare no expense. They have n\u2019t. 5. Lastly but far from leastly come to Puerto Rico. We have traveled the world. We have stayed at very nice places. We know how to vacation. While friends and family go to Hawaii and Mexico and other islands in the Caribbean we try them all and always come back to Puerto Rico.

They really pay attention to your needs ahead of time which to me is what you are paying for. They embody not only service but also excellent accommodations and amenities. As one of the other well written reviews stated this is an investment in yourself and we felt this investment was worth it. I also think this was an investment in the people of Puerto Rico and although they do need it right now the Island is open doing well and ready for visitors. All local airports businesses and shops seemed very ready for business. The resort staff went way above and beyond the basic expectations. It shows in their actions as well as in their words with you as a guest during your stay. The pool team was also wonderful in their service and their willingness to share their stories and culture with you. They helped make rainy days at the pool fun with simple actions like bringing you dry towels and an umbrella when I decided to sit it out in the hot tub. We stayed here in PR at another high end resort prior to Maria and we wanted to return to see this place. We are so glad we did and this is such a wonderful resort on so many levels. The rebuild was mainly vegetation and not so much structure damage done during Hurricane Maria. They did take the opportunity to add some neat features like the brand new infinity edge hot tub complete with cold plunge and killer views. It looks right out over the edge of the beach onto the ocean so you relax and listen to the waves. We have also experienced many high end spa treatments and this is at the top in terms of services and architectural appeal. The attention to details in the spa the treatment rooms the apothecary entry the music and the outdoor showers complete with plunge buckets are all amazing. They blend in so well and you truly relax from the moment you walk into the breath taking entry. We did several treatments this time but the best was the Apothecary Play for Two. Very romantic and I highly recommend it. I also suggest taking advantage of the free bikes during your stay it is a great way to get around and see the entire property but it is also just fun and relaxing. Part of trail has trees around it that have not been repaired cut and you get a solid feel for the powerful winds from Maria. I could go on for days but everything from the room the pools the service the caring attitudes are truly wonderful and I appreciate that you do not feel nickel and dimed at the end. If you are thinking about it. stop thinking and book it.", "offset": [566, 643], "date": "2018-10-23", "cpt": "3", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 31, "uid": "18582ad4-d57a-4305-a16f-cdcc6f63ee9d", "sentence": "Re opened property looks terrific but lots of kinks needs to be worked out on the service at the very expensive price. Dear Ritz Dorado General Manager George Sotelo I was hoping to deliver this to you in person but could not find you this morning. In any event given you recently reopened I wanted to give you a comprehensive review of your product. My family and I stayed with you December 21 28. My kids are 15 and 17 years old. We used virtually all the products and services your resort offers. I will give more details below but in summary I would recommend your resort to my friends and family with one caveat the concierge service is terrible. My view is guests should rationalize the cost of your resort excluding any value being delivered by the concierge service. Now more details. The Resort Property world class. No discernible impact from hurricanes. The nature walk around the property is terrific and makes for an excellent bike ride andor running path. Rooms Loved our 2 bedroom suite. One of the best rooms we have ever stayed in. The living room doors opening to the ocean really made the room extra special. Ample room. Very comfortable. Housekeeping The housecleaning was ok to good. The room was always clean but there were several problems they failed to remove the garbage a couple of times but they may have thought it was not garbagethey did not clean the sun deck they did not replenish the consumables laundry bags mini bar. etcLaundry. For the most part good. The only issue was we were not informed that laundry was not available on Christmas Day. Again lack of communication. Restaurants. We ate at all the restaurants on property. The quality of the food and the service was world class. The standout was Encanto where the chef came out and greeted us and Guilermo provided great service. The golf cart taxi service to and from restaurants on property is always a treat when Jonathan at the helm. East Beach. Rented a sail boat and the staff was pleasant and helpful. Fitness Center. The counter staff was inviting and the overall facility was excellent. The basketball court was a major plus. We did not play tennis or volleyball but the facilities looked terrific. Pools and cabana Both pools are huge and exceptionally clean. Water temperature was perfect. The hot tub is also perfect with terrific views of the surf. That staff around the pool and beach are great and took care of our every need. Bartenders Jese and. Chucky we \u2019re extra special and added positively to our experience. Bikes brand new and high quality. Love being able to keep bikes entire stay at our room. Spa. The facility was stunning and unique. The staff was equally impressive. We had a couple of treatments that were all excellent and delivered in an extremely professional manner. Front desk Not perfect here. We called on a couple of occasions to have our rental car brought up from valet service and they never delivered the message to the guys getting the car. We got to the valet and no car and basically confusion by the staff. Additionally on several occasions the staff did not know the answers to basic questions like \u201c where is the closest ladies room \u201d. Feels like the front desk had not been properly trained. Concierge embarrassingly bad. It stated before we arrived as we attempted to set up a variety of activities. The staff seemed very confused and did not execute very clear written requests such as cancelling a restaurant reservations or arranging a cabana. Once we arrived it got worse. My daughter spoke to the manager and asked if they could recommend some community service activities. The manager assured her they could provide options. Unfortunately they never followed up. I set up a helicopter tour and dinner only to be informed the afternoon of our departure that we would not be able to go together which was never communicated to me. Fortunately my wife took matters in her own hands and sorted out with the helicopter company and we were able to execute the experience. Lastly we asked your team to set up a private catamaran for a day. They reported back that they could not get staff to man the boat and offered no alternatives. Again my wife took over and after a few calls had a great boat for us to tour the local islands and we had a great day. Over the last few days of our trip the concierge staff attempted to redeem themselves as they clearly sensed that they were in a deep hole but it was too late. I hope this review helps you refine your resort and its services. When you charge what you charge there is no room for error as others Four Seasons etc deliver perfection at that price point.", "offset": [4014, 4080], "date": "2018-12-30", "cpt": "4", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 32, "uid": "a2095603-1987-4bb6-8ec3-3801952fd6c7", "sentence": "Beautiful but too many problems for the price. Let me say to start off that this property is absolutely stunning in its beauty. There are a number of positive points. Everyone is extremely pleasant and tries to be helpful. I had like to single out the pool beach staff the Positivo restaurant the Spa the bellmen and the staff at the TPC Dorado Beach as excellent parts of the Ritz. However echoing some of the other reviews here there is a missing link in terms for making sure everything works together. The embajadors are supposed to provide this seamless integration and indeed many are excellent they change often. In principle an embajador is the main contact point that allows for one to avoid dealing with multiple people individually ie concierge bellman housekeeping reservations etc. However often times this system breaks down. For instance there were numerous occasions when it would take an hour or more to receive word back about setting up an appointment getting a recommendation etc and often we only heard back because we had contact them again reminding them that we inquired and they had still not gotten back to us. Other times things we had ask to be done were only partially done for instance requesting housekeeping not to disturb us for a baby taking a nap but then someone showed up to check on the mini fridge. On one occasion we could not reach the embajador nor the front desk but luckily someone picked up on the embajador manager line. Once we got the feel for the property we simply stopped using the embajadors unles absolutely necessary because it only provided a layer of bureaucracy that slowed things down rather than making things easier. All in all this would not be a big deal we are familiar with using concierges or calling the necessary people. However the problem at this Ritz is the price in comparison to the service offered. For a 23 or 12 of the cost one can get far better run experiences at a St Regis or a Four Seasons. Now it is quite possible that in the future this property will gain enough experience post Maria to be what it was before. However I strongly urge anyone interested in staying here to read recent reviews and see where the service stands. The individual service is great but there is something lacking about how it all works together right now. For the price there should not be any reservations about whether this rates as a 5 it should be automatic. In fact if it was property alone this would be a 5 but service at this point I have to say is a 3 given the price.", "offset": [2209, 2314], "date": "2019-01-18", "cpt": "4", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 33, "uid": "464a38ed-219d-46ab-8255-37ed68a2c0cd", "sentence": "Great property service inconsistent for this price point. The Dorado Beach is a fabulous property. The grounds are sprawling and perfectly maintained rooms are spacious with gorgeous views there are 5 restaurants three at the hotel and two at the golf course championship level golf courses. Could n\u2019t ask for much more in that respect. But the reason you pay this kind of money 150 per night to stay at a property like this is for the superior service. And while the staff are all very pleasant the service levels are inconsistent at best and fall well short of resorts at this price point. This is why I ca n\u2019t give the place five stars for this category of resort it just does n\u2019t cut it. You are assigned an team of Embasadores for your stay who are supposed to coordinate your every ned dinner reservations activities beach chairs etc. We had one who was impeccable the other two would forget to follow up on requests and had to be reminded. We were asked what time we wanted housekeeping and turndown service which set the expectation of a particular time. We were lucky if we even got turn down service and if we did they came at any random time. Housekeeping forgot to come twice. It was very difficult to get a reservation in the restaurants even 3 or 4 days ahead. The spa was virtually fully booked four days out with only two or three appointment slots offered to us over. 4 day period. I got really tired of hearing the apology that they were \u2018 fully committed \u2019. At this price point I should be able to get a reasonable dinner reservation not the bar at the golf club and a spa appointment. It \u2019s very disappointing to spend this kind of money and spend your vacation frustrated that you have gotten closed out. I do n\u2019t know if it \u2019s a training issue or a staffing level issue but the property is n\u2019t delivering what it should be for this price point.", "offset": [454, 591], "date": "2019-01-22", "cpt": "4", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 34, "uid": "ca52a0f5-b12a-49ae-8966-e819c10dff02", "sentence": "Beautiful Grounds Amazing Food Friendly Staff Nickel Dimed Not 5 Diamond Service. We stayed in an East Plunge pool room. The room was amazing and the outdoor shower was great. The east rooms seemed to offer more privacy on the balcony so we were happy about that. The food was very good quality including room service. It was so close to the ocean so we could sit and enjoy hearing the waves break 24 7. The service was generally friendly however unlike other Ritzs or Four Seasons the staff were not jumping out of their shoes to serve. I understand that this is subjective. This is going to be the snotty part of the review so if you are not super critical and looking to get everything you feel you should out of a 130 night room take the first part of the review and then move on. It felt like we were Nickel Dimed on things. I like staying at nice hotels to avoid that specifically. I do not want to pay 4 for a refill of my Diet Coke. If we ask for a 2nd lounge chair for our patio so we can stay private in our room figure it out but do not say no. Take my review with a grain of salt as I am a discerning picky traveller but if you are prepared for these things you will not resent the hotel or staff when you get there. The spa was amazing.

Unfortunately they do n\u2019t live up to Ritz standards with service and even after our complaints nobody followed up or corrected the issues. The complex is massive. We arrived in the evening and were greeted with a welcome drink and popscicle. We got a nice tour.

By the time he got back to me all the morning slots had been taken. The strangest part about the entire vacation was that we NEVER met our butler. Not once. We have had butler service everywhere else and it was unparalleled. So we decided to speak to a manager about it. We spoke to a gentleman named Willis to my recollection. He said he could n\u2019t believe what we were saying and he would make it right. What happened next. Absolutely nothing. We filled out the Ritz Survey that was sent to us and gave it an honest poor review. A GM Pedro Furao responded and claimed they would call us to chat about it but never did.

The room was slightly dirty which you do n\u2019t expect at a Ritz Carlton property however the real issue was with the poorly trained staff. The service was absolutely awful from the butler to the house cleaning and restaurant servers. We actually had one of the beach attendants behave in a hostile and threatening manner as he delivered drinks to us more then an hour after ordering. By the time they arrived we were getting ready for dinner and no longer wanted them. He behaved inappropriately and even threateningly. After that experience and an unsatisfactory follow up with both our room butler and the manager of the entire property we actually felt unsafe. The rest of the trip did not improve.

If I had to do it again I would stay on the west beach as you can walk right out to the calm sandy beach protected by the break wall. On the east side there is no swimming but the scenery and the sound of the waves is worth the price of admission you are really right on top of the water. The suite itself was one of the best we have ever experienced. The finishes throughout gave a sense of place and were very tastefully done. The outdoor showers were certainly a hit and the plunge pool was always a nice break from the main pool when we wanted something more low key. Between the restaurants and room service we did not experience a bad meal. The food was absolutely outstanding across the board. We took advantage of the babysitting service one night the kids had room service and loved the babysitter and enjoyed the semi private sushi dinner. Best sushi dinner of our life and the experience itself was something that we will not forget. As for the experiences we did not really leave the property. We spent most of our time at the main pool and the beach was too windy choppy to snorkel but swimming and jumping waves was good enough which provided plenty of family fun. We also went to the water park and the kids took surf classes both of which were well worth it. Overall it was just an incredible experience.
