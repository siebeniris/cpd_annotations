As February approaches all things on mind Key West is most important. This year was my fourth trip third staying at Parrot Key. This year was going to be no different than others so we thought. It started a week before check in when I called to confirm I could have a package delivered even if it was going to arrive a day or three prior to check in. Of course they say yes no worries front desk will sign for it and all. With prior experience not only as a guest but working a front desk I knew this option was available and hardly ever a risk. However me being a slight worrier I called ahead the day of check in three days after receiving text and email confirmation that my package had been delivered I wanted it at check in calling ahead 7 hours prior to arrival to be sure it was there and available when we check in was not clear. It could not be located no one had an answer. My first call was received and I was told I had hear back I let four hours pass and nothing. Call again getting a different representative and she informs me the same but again assured a call back in which I never received. Upon arrival you can guess it my package no where to be found. I am told give them until morning ok sure enough morning comes the package is found well the contents of. Someone had all ready opened my addressed package and even went further as to ask to see what was inside what all the fuss was about when they were picked up. I was furious and disappointed. You would not think a resort charging almost three grand for a weeks stay would be so unprofessional as to open a package and not have it available day of check in when all information was available to do so. On top of my calls throughout the day. Furthermore when we entered our room a horrible stale stench of dampness and urine hit our noses thinking it was just humidity we dealt with it with air freshener from the luckily next door Walgrens the stench never totally dissipated. Pretty sure it is from the wild cats that sleep under the porches and buildings. It was confirmed that it was not just our room when in a random cab ride down to Duval we shared with other PK guests whom asked us of the stench wondering if it were just them or their room can not be good for business. Also during all other stays at PK on a daily basis the sand out on the back side of the room was beautifully groomed this year far from it. Littered with cigarette butts on a no smoking campus other debris and rocks. As well as not nearly as groomed as normal a lazy path or two with the rake swept down and back doing no good on two days I noticed it had not been done at all. Again a Resort charging over 200 per night should hold better standards. I know from prior stays they are capable of MUCH MUCH better would not have mind seeing the same this year as well as a place I call home for a week I am highly dissatisfied. PK also took advantage of upgrading or so they said their rental bikes this off season. The bikes are horrible. they are beyond uncomfortable. We left our parked for over two days because we could not bare riding them any further. On a 2mile island we usually averaged 14 miles a day on our bikes. this year barely the 3 miles. They have no basket instead an area to place a bag and use a bungee to secure it which is notsuper secure for a smaller bang at all. We even returned them a day earlier than checkout and ate over 40day in cab costs to avoid riding them. We took much more advantage of the convenience of the cafe on grounds for drinks considering our first breakfast was subpar I ate less than half of my fruit plate because it was mostly mushy fruit and had a sour taste. Fresh berries must have been excused for the day. I do not now that more than a bagel for food was ordered after that experience. In addition to the all ready stated problems parking is also an issue as there are 75 rooms and a quarter that in parking. They inform you up front and suggest walgrens as the alternative however this time we were able to find a spot a spot in which the new Dodge Ram pickup did not move any of our 7 day stay however we were parked in a spot that neighbored a spot not actually for parking but also not clearly labeled as the walkway in which you can see it lead toat some point due to lack of proper marking someone chose to park there and left two very deep scratch marks on the truck both approximately 7 long. Did not see these until after checking out because again we did not drive our vehicle after parking it after checking in. With no cameras monitoring and making sure they state to park at your own risk which should be no risk if the parking lot were properly marked and adequate parking were available for the amount of guests they plan to house. They are not liable which is wrong considering we were properly parked. Needless to say this experience trumped all other good ones with Parrot Key with the constant irreconcilable issues. At this point this annual trip will not include PK again.

HeloI booked your hotel via bokingcom at 10 PM on 4819. I arrived just before 11 pm. The young man at the front desk was very confused and kept stating that he was going to have to upgrade the room but was scared he would get into trouble. After an hour and another man coming into the lobby to help this nice Jamaican man I was told that there was no accommodation for my family. It was me my mom whom is handicapped also my 4 year old son. My elderly aunt and my 27 year old niece also. He kept trying to put us in a room I did not book and would n\u2019t accommodate us comfortably. I told him so long as I was n\u2019t being charged I would seek accommodation elsewhere as it was after midnight and truthfully I was tired of waiting for nothing. He agreed to cancel my reservation. Well I was charged on my card. I called bokingcom who called you and was told that your person documented that I had more than 5 people. This is not the case. I have been on hold at this point with Parrot Key for 41 minutes to get someone just to help me as bokingcom ca n\u2019t assist. This is unacceptable. I want this resolved.

The Parrot Key Hotel is a fine Establishment already. For us what really separated our trip experience from the others was the hotel management service.

We had an enjoyable stay at Parrot Key Hotel. The waterfront room was more than satisfactory the pool area was exquisite and we took advantage of the bike hire during our stay. We felt like we had the perfect island experience. However I must point out a couple of negatives. Firstly the website is very misleading as the photos appear to have edited out the pylons in the lake. Additionally a white fence has been erected preventing full view of lake and more sun loungers have been added to beach reducing secluded space. Furthermore on departure we experienced MANY additional fees which we had n\u2019t accounted for. I would have rated 5 out of 5 on rating if it was n\u2019t for these points.", "offset": [421, 565], "date": "2019-06-03", "cpt": "3", "category": "general"}, {"id": 36, "uid": "d96929d1-c871-48bd-ac82-817215fb3a5c", "sentence": "Cruise Friends.
