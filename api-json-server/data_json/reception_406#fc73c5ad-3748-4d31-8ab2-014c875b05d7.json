The Staff are great. We booked a Suite but arrived quite early in the day after disembarking from a cruise and none were available at that time of day 940 am. With a 3 yr old in tow I did not relish the idea of waiting around and wasting the day so the they gave us a lovely Standard room and helped out with some extra amenities. Paolina at the front desk was exceptionally professional and just made a huge positive first impression on us. What a wonderful and valuable ambassador or host she was. Room is very nice. King bed was nice and the room comes with a lots of stowage space for luggage as well as a desk and a sofa and enough floor space with loads of room for our 3 yr old to play around in and spread her toys around without getting underfoot. We all liked the room. Loved the big safe that can fit a laptop and 2 iPads 2 Ipods wallets documents etc. King bed was greatThe water dispenser with good size glasses in the Motor Lobby for arriving guests was a nice touch. I can not recall many hotels that provide such a thoughtful amenity for their guests just in from the heat outside and it sort of highlights the care they put into their guest service and comfort. Starbucks Coffee service in the Lounge bar was great. I do not normally visit the lounges in hotels but this place was very open and inviting. Tricia was very pleasant and acomodating. They ran out of my tea but she did offer several other kinds and gave me the hot water to use my own teabags upstairs. The pool is big 30 x 50 with a 3 ft shallow end. it is a fiberglass pool I think which is first for us but it was nice and the water was clean. I used to build pools for a living so I always take note of the pools. The 6 8 steps into the pool were quite 2 ft wide and very useful for non swimming youngsters to play around with a parent watching. Deck area is large and clean with lots of available loungers and a well kept towel service. Not too many shade umbrellas though. The Smoking area in the Motor Lobby was the nicest I have ever seen and that is from somebody on the road who lives in hotels 40 weeks a year. Comfortable seating clean and well out of the way of non smokers One of the biggest pluses of this hotel is it is proximity to the People mover. The OMNI station is an easy 100 yds away. It provides easy access to all of downtown and the Brickel Village area. it is free by the way. Also nearby the hotel PUBLIX and a number of fast food places. Neighborhood felt quite safe in getting to them.", "offset": [1205, 1258], "date": "2015-08-29", "cpt": "0", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 3, "uid": "06dc435d-619e-4f77-93c5-2c45ca88fcb6", "sentence": "Top shelf all the way.

Like so many Hiltons this one seemed to have been renovated piecemeal over the last decade or so. The hallways especially showed age. The first few floors are undergoing updates so in good time it will be much better aesthetics wise. Service was great and amenities clean. The couch in my room was a bit worn and should have been replaced some time ago. HOWEVER I had a corner room on the 15th floor with a million dollar view. It made it all worth every penny. I slept with curtains open to just enjoy the nightime floor to ceiling window view.

The staff in the Brisa restaurant and at the to go bar were wonderful and professional. The parking attendants were also great. They got my car so quickly. I did not have the same positive experience when I visited the hotel in January 2017. The woman at the frontdesk for some reason questioned my honors status when it is in her computer asked for my honors number before she even gave me complimentary waters. She did not give me any other Diamond member benefits. I had to ask for my room to be changed she initially gave me an old unrenovated room finally another staff member helped with all of my diamond members perks.

My overall all experience was sub par. I have stayed at numerous Hiltons and this is by far the worst customer service I have experienced. My arrival was great we were warmly welcomed by valet and guest services. Later on that same arrival day we decided to dine in at the hotel restaurant downstairs. The hostess rudely greeted us and that immediately took my appetite away. Only one of elevators worked so we had to wait at least 15 to 20 minutes for elevators to arrive. Because of the delayed of the elevators people would just scrunch in to the point where it was over capacity. The rooms itself was not bad it was very spacious clean and updated. I really appreciated the refrigerator in the room. I just wished there was more than one trash can. Our departure was a complete contrast from our arrival. There was a wait time of 30 to 45 minutes for luggage carrier. The valet check out lady was very boorish. Probably the worst staff there. We ended up having to get the key and fetch for our own car.

Not a lot of modern outlets for cell phones though. Elevators super slow so they had a staff member running the elevators to help get them moving for cruise passengers.
