I have had a good experience with other Joie de Vivre hotels but this was not a good experience. The room we had was noisy. There was lots of light leaking in from the hall way through the front door and the water pressure in the shower was low. The staff were great and very helpful. They just could not make up for the shortcomings in the facility itself. We heard TV noise from the other rooms and staff doing their cleaning work in the nearby common living room space.

Yes you do hear the train but I was on vacation and did not mind it at all. Yes it is an older hotel but everything was working. The keys were a challenge but we always got into our room. The service is absolutely wonderful. We had a beautiful bay view suite that overlooked the bay and Jack London Square. Our daughter who is local to the area joined us for a couple of days and stayed on the pull out sofa in the other room. She valetd her car since the parking garages fill up fast. It gets cool at night so the fireplace was a nice touch. During the day however it was warm enough to leave the deck doors open. The valet service was very helpful from parking our car driving us for free down into Oakland and getting us a limo when we were leaving for the airport. We \u00fcberd to The Waterfront but were a little nervous doing the same at 430a in the morning. We enjoyed several restaurants in the area including Lungomares which we could access from inside our building. We had our breakfast down there every day. We took advantage of the ferry to San Francisco which was a stones throw away from the hotel.

Positive. very Nice staff including Ime who was helpful and serviceminded. Our Room had a partial sea view and had a balcony with furniture. The furniture was decent and the bed was comfortable the sheets were soft. There is a place Plank just next to the hotel that was great. The Ferry to the San Francisco is just 100 meters from the hotel. It costs 6 dollars. Overall very secure hotel and there is a lot of staff. The pool was heated. Negative be aware that it takes time to get to San Francisco if you decide to take subway. The immediate area that the hotel was situated was very cozy but further on it was quite a boring area. The railway is a couple of streets away the trains make a lot of warning signals when they pass by so be aware of that. However we were not disturbed in the nights.

Every question I asked whether it was how much is an average Uber ride to the airport or is there a convenience store nearby. Was met with a blank stare and an I do not know. When I asked how I get a shuttle back to the hotel that night I was told by the bellman to just call the hotel. When I asked for a card with the number on it he stared at me blankly and then ruffled through a drawer and then told me he did not have one. When I went to the front desk and asked for the same thing I was met with the same response until the manager came out and direct the young lady what to do. When I was not informed that the shuttle did not run on Saturdays after discussing with them that I would need a shuttle I was directed to an obscure sign on the wall. When I brought it up with the front desk mentioning that I now had no way to get to my location she turned the other way offer no help or solutions. I even asked the time from a maintenance person and he stared at me blankly maybe he did not speak English. I am uncertain. I do have to say they are all very nice just really uninformed. I felt like I was in some sort of hotel twilight zone. Also there are no services at the hotel so in the am there is coffee served but no tea. In the room it is the same coffee only.
