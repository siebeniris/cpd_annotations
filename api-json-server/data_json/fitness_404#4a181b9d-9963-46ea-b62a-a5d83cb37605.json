The savings with the bundle was good vs booking separately. After researching this hotel and many others I was worried after booking this resort and reading the WIDELY varying reviews. No need. We had a five star stay. Jonathan at check in was wonderful and gave us some complimentary drink tickets that is a super nice welcome I will admit. Check in was very smooth and quick. We arrived around 645 pm so our room was ready. We were given room 53 which was kitty corner across from the elevator in the main tower. You might think that that location would be noisy or busy but it actually was wonderful. We had the hallway to ourselves pretty much the whole time and noticed no extra noise. Having the elevator so close was a bonus when we brought our pool beach bag down each day too leswalking with all our stuf. Our room was delightful. After hearing all about the lack of cleanliness and small showers and bathrooms you can imagine my worries. No need. The room was perfectly clean and we are picky. It was plenty large for the three of us with two queen beds a couch and table area a tv table area and the closet area. We were there for the week and found plenty of storage space for our clothes in the closet with the drawers and hanging areas. We utilized the safe and had no issues. The bathroom. I saw lots of complaints on the reviews. Not me. It was modern and updated and just fine. I even took pictures of the shower as I would like to remodel our home shower to something similar. In the afternoons we noticed the hot water took a long time in coming. No big deal we were never in a hurry and the hot water DID come and plenty of it eventually. The lobby is vibrant with sound and activity each evening especially the weekend nights. We enjoyed the atmosphere very much although did not partake much in the actual dancing it was enough to sit on a comfortable couch sip a mojito and watch the comings and goings. The Gallery shops were very nice expensive of course but a nice touch. We enjoyed the Godiva Chocolatier very muchWe rented a car from Enterprise which is located right in the hotel. The gal that helped us sorry to not remember her name was AWESOME. She held our hands through the whole process including loading up our GPS with the destinations we wanted to hit and retrieving the car for us and getting the air conditioning going. The weather was perfect which always helps of course. The pool areas were excellent special shout out to Jesie who took us and our towels over to the canopies and set us up each day including one day when it looked like all were taken. He and the other pool staff have a few they keep in reserve I think. This was all done for free I had no cash on me for tip and he searched us out each day extremely helpful and kind. The beach was stellar. So clean and lovely. I had hemmed and hawed all week prior to our trip as to weather or not to pack my wet suit. I get cold easily when I swim. Glad I did not pack it. The water was plenty warm and the waves mostly mild but still body surf able. We mostly walked down to the left a bit to be in front of the Water and Beach Club as that sand was even nicer and farther away from the jet ski rentals. The water was very clear for the Atlantic and a beautiful sea green blue color. The sand is golden but nicely firm and smooth and shell rock free. We spent hours in the ocean. we spent hours in the pools too. The pools were perfectly warm as well. No wet suit needed. They have a really nice shower area so you can rinse off the beach before you hit the pools. Pool service was excellent. Lots of attentive staff to take drink and food orders. All served with a smile and care. Saturday afternoons are CRAZY busy at the big pool it is like a big frat party the music is pumping and all the beautiful people are in the pool and partying. We are several years beyond that scene but were not at all bothered by it. I enjoyed the music and we chose to swim at one of the other pools. All good. During the week it was plenty quiet and low key. Lots of kids making new friends in the pools everyone friendly. Food Jimmys on the rooftop was fine for a casual meal the first night. We enjoyed the chicken quesidilas and sangria. KOKO and El Piccolo were EXCELLENT cost you and arm and a leg but worth it. Great staff professional yet fun. The casino clean plenty of choices and fun. We are not big gamblers by any means. Each of us spent 10 mins and 10 on the slots and that was the extent of our experience. but still a fun amusementOver all this vacation was one of our best ever.

I like nice things and only now want 4 star or better hotels so decided to try this place. Big mistake. Unlike like most 4 and 5 star here you do NOT get what you paid for. My 70 nt room smelled like fresh paint and had construction debris on the carpet in the hallway. The accommodations were shabby and not 5 star at all. There were 2 sinks which was nice but overall the best thing at this hotel was the lobby and nice but very expensive restaurants. There were protestors outside and no one warned us. They woke us up at 7 am and blasted horns in our ears as we tried to relax on the beach in the afternoon. While the staff are truly outstanding here especially at the pool I would never stay here again. In the evenings they have live entertainment in the hotel but you can not see or enjoy them unles you are willing to pay for bottle service or buy drinks. What kind of crap is that. This hotel is trying to be something its not. If guests are dropping 70 nt provide them something for their money.

The El San Juan is a famous hotel this was where Samy Davis Jr and Frank Sinatra performed and stayed but it needed to be renovated. I stayed there recently during the soft opening so renovations were not completed but it is clear the hotel now part of the Hilton Curio collection is doing a terrific job of keeping the old charm the carved wooden ceiling and walls in the lobby the historic chandelier that was removed and re installed piece by piece while updating the rooms with modern conveniences. My favorite Keurig espresso makers in each room and extremely comfortable luxurious beds. There are several beautiful pools we had a large iguana casually make her way through one of them one day. right on the beautiful beach is Isla Verde. There were a few re opening glitches fire alarms went off several times and water was briefly out one morning. But the hotel was great about it even finding a room for my partner to shower when the water was out as he had to go to a work meeting. I can not say enough about the staff who greet you wherever you are in the hotel ask how things are going. The check in staff the housekeeper s the bartenders and servers. all terrific. And the food is excellent and surprisingly affordable for a luxury hotel. Drinks are expensive but that is typical for the area hotels. And the el San Juans are more generously poured than ones at say the Intercontinental next door. I highly recommend the coconut mojito it is more milky with coconut milk than regular mojitos and has toasted shaved coconut on top. it is excellent as is the pear sangria. There a disco and nice looking restaurants in the lobby did not go to either ate at the bars restaurants by the pool and it is very elegant. in fact they ask you not to hang around in the lobby in your beachwear in the evenings. There is also live music in an open0sided room in the lobby it all makes you feel like you are in 1950s Havana. I like some of the Condado area hotels but the El San Juan has much more of a Caribbean feel I like. The staff at the pool come around and offer to clean your sunglasses spritz you with aloe water or give you a free shot of the tropical drink of the day. One of the polside staffers saw that there were kids in the pool alone their mom was nearby and went over the engage them in a game of pool to polside volleyball. Very nice of her. Right outside the hotel perimeter on the beach there is jetski rental and a massage place.

We just stayed 7 nights at the El San Juan hotel. Overall the stay was wonderful and very relaxing as was our previous stay in 2015 before the recent renovations. Everyone on the staff that we interacted with including the front desk housekeeping restaurant servers pool staff etc was pleasant helpful and spoke fluent English. I would particularly put in a good word for security guy Angel who was stationed most mornings at the door from the hotel lobby to the pool area. He took my side in some good natured ribbing of my wife who refused to let me continue our vacation each morning until we first exercised. Other positives about this stay were the nightly music in the hotel lobby area and the immaculate condition that all the grounds were kept including our hotel room and the pools. There were a couple of things that perhaps could have been beter1. Drink prices at the lobby bars and polside bar were a bit steep 14 15 plus tip and 11 tax for tropical drinks 12 17 for a glass of house wines. Not all of the hotels restaurants have re opened following renovations and those open were also a bit expensive. The good news is that there are numerous local restaurants within a short 2 10 minute walk of the hotel that served excellent local food at more moderate prices2. The temperature in the hotel lobby and on the room floors was kept extremely cold every night. No doubt this is better than being too warn in a tropical climate but we needed a light jacket or shawl while enjoying the music in the lobby and even with the room air conditioner off had to wear a shirt while sleeping. Seems like the hotel could save a lot of money on its electric bills by keeping the temperature 5 or more degrees warmer in the evening. As I write this there is a bit of a labor dispute going on at the property apparently stemming from changes made during the renovation period. Protesters were set up on the street in front of the hotel and on the beach near the hotel. They were noisy at times but never interfered at all as were entered or left the hotel.

If you ignore the reviews and give it a shot anyway word of warning when going to the pool during one of their party hours. GET A WRISTBAND. The security personnel ran out of wristbands during our stay and we were only given one for two people. My husband was harassed by security personnel and had to be verified as a guest every 5 mins. He was verified over 6 times in 30 mins. It was so bad we ultimately chose to skip the pool entirely and just head to the beach. No peace on the beach due to protestors ready with bull horns and microphone sirens. It was disastrous to say the least. We ended up having to go to an entirely different property just to enjoy the beach have dinner and walk around in peace.

It was too late to go complain so I lived with it. When I told the front desk their response we will make a note of it. Again no apologies.

My colleagues and I decided to eat dinner at the hotel and we went to their signature restaurant on the terrace serving Puerto Rican style food. It was so so at best. The appetizers were very good but the main courses were dull and sort of over cooked. You have to see experience the lobby when the bar is hopping and the band is playing and people are dancing. It is a movie scene of Old San Juan of the 1950s. Great atmosphere very lively if you enjoy that. The music was loud and it was boisterous. The style is also Old San Juan with a wood beam ceiling. lots of wood paneling in the lobby area. The hotel room itself I have to say despite the maintenance was very comfortable. There was a chaise lounge that was very comfortable to stretch out and relax and the bed was good too. It was funny to turn on the TV and see New York news stations. I was in the basic room in the tower. I did not see any others in the low rise buildings but they did have an outdoor terrace I saw. The neighborhood is very commercial. it is a short walk to the chain drug stores fast food or some nice local restaurants all within walking distance. Also pretty close to the airport.

I felt the Front Desk staff demonstrated a \u201c you are bothering me \u201d too many times as I witnessed their interactions and had them happen to myself. On different days with different people \u2013 if this can be fixed then the entire hotel from check in to accommodations to service is worthy of 5Stars and should quickly become the 1 Hotel in this area.

Directly across the street is a Chili \u2019s nicest one I \u2019ve been in with a good Happy Hour and solid food selections at very reasonable prices. A 10min walk takes you to a local grocery store to include ability to pick up wine beer and alcohol. Considerations A 17 cab ride two people with 2 bags \u2013. taxis have a charge per bag and 7min ride from the airport if staying in the tower portion of the hotel ask for a room with odd numbers if you like to sleep in as the even number side rooms face East and sun is up brightly by 060 and you will notice. Aerobics the gym has numerous machines on the 2nd floor and the roof 3rd floor has punching bags and an area that supports a Cross Fit workout. I would recommend an early morning walk on the beach for a workout along a quiet and empty beautiful beach. If seeking a Casino a 7 to 10 minute walk or quick Uber ride gets you to a few places to invest. DO spend some time having a beverage at one of the Lobby Bars with the entertainment in the background going on \u2013 transforms one back in time to the way Old World Charm hospitality use to be.

Cana Bar Staff was great especaily the young lady who made us hot tea she was very excited to do so and the presentation was lovely. The cappuccino ordered there was delicious. The outdoor Bartender Martin was corky intelligent and funny. Unfortunately the chip and dip took 30 mins to be delivered at the bar and it was not good. The Spa staff were very friendly and informative although i did not partake in yoga or activities. If you want to take a taxi do not ask the valet outside to hail one. the valet just clapped his hands and a car came over. the cab to old san juan was 20 Uber charged 5 on our return to the hotel. Woman at the shop shoes accessories was lovely and helpful.
