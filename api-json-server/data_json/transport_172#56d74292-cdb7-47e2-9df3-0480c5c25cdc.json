Add the fact that due to a corporate event the pool and hotubs were not open for another day and you realize your not able to use the basic things you expect at a normal hotel much less a Resort. Now lets continue to location. your off the strip so expect cab rides of avg 15 each way 4 or 6 times a day and that shuttle service to the strip that is mentioned at check in every 15 minutes. after wating for it two days in the 100 degree heat and deciding to grab a cab we finally see one of the shuttles and upon speaking to driver are informed oh no sir it is once an hour. so on third day we try to grab the shuttle at 8 pm to eat dinner on the strip. sorry shuttle stops running at 7 pm.", "offset": [1028, 1064], "date": "2015-09-08", "cpt": "0", "category": "transport"}, {"id": 3, "uid": "92ecb603-dc96-4313-bd5b-4436f94da1d5", "sentence": "Nice hotel but far from the strip.

Great size in property Bad notes. the walk with our luggage from the registration counter was too long till paradise tower the entire hotel is carpeted so it was even more difficult to drag our bags. they could arrange for another counter for registration check out next to the paradise tower. To get to the free shuttle service it is far from our tower in short inside movement is tiring In fact to even to get to Uber we need to go all the way to the main entrance from our tower. the hotel does not provide any free coupons for facilities like other hotels provide. The room we stayed in had a bad smell coming from the drainage every time we took a shower the same has been informed to the hotel stafthe hotel is not on the strip so get set to walk for about 15 mins to get to the strip or you can Uber it which would cost you around 5 6House keeping the slowest we have ever seen. when we entered our room there were no in room slippers bathrobe vanity box etc. we called the house keeping to provide us we waited for 45 mins and no one turned up. we left for sight seeing and when we returned all the goods had arrived.

Good notes. the staff upgraded us from Casino tower to Paradise tower Plenty of options when it comes to dinning with in the hotelshutle services to 2 points makes it easy to plan your sight seeing.

My husband and I stayed here for 3 nights recently for my 30th birthday. We booked a room in the HRH Tower which are slightly more upscale rooms and we were definitely glad we did. The room was very spacious with a nice lounge area with a corner sofa and separate bedroom area separated by a tv wall. The noise proofing was very good we did n\u2019t hear a thing during our stay which was impressive given the amount of things going on in the hotel. The bathroom was huge with a nice marble his and hers sink a \u2018 tea for two \u2019 bath and a separate shower. There are a few restaurant options within the hotel but not as many as some of the bigger resorts so something to keep in mind. One thing that really annoyed me was the Dunkin Donuts in the hotel it was more than double the normal price. Save yourself the cash and walk across the road to the Dunkin Donuts there. The hotel run a free shuttle bus on the hour between 10AM5PM which drops off and picks up at the Fashion Show Mall. This is definitely necessary as it is too far to walk to the main strip. Overall the hotel was very clean and all the staff we encountered in the hotel and casino were all very pleasant. However this definitely has a smaller and quieter vibe than many of the hotels on the strip but given its location off the strip this is n\u2019t really surprising. I think it really depends what you want from your time in Vegas and for us we would have prepared to have been closer to the main action rather than having to get a bus or uber everytime we wanted to go to another resort. However I do n\u2019t think you \u2019l be disappointed if you stay here especially in the HRH Tower as it is a very cool hotel.", "offset": [1199, 1358], "date": "2017-10-14", "cpt": "0", "category": "transport"}, {"id": 9, "uid": "f19f8eea-cc32-4eff-8c16-c8d1695d469e", "sentence": "Poor shuttle service.

The walk is only a few blocks but that is not good service in my opinion.
