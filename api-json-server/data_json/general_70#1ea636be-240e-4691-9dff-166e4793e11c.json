People might have stayed in this hotel and had a great experience. However the true colours come out when issues come up. The hotel is a bad spot for two major reasons 1. Dishonesty. 2.

Due to the nature of the business the whole group works at night and sleep during the day. I tell you it is extremely hard to sleep when there are drills and hammers going of all around. People have to work too but why the floor was even rented out when the guests experience is comparable to staying in the factory. I have asked a front desk to relocate me to a more peaceful room and the clerk told me that there are no quite rooms. Poor customer service due to multiple complaints it was decided that the stay in the hotel would be cut short by 3 nights. The decision was made at 330 pm. At that point I was notified of the decision and had to drive down to the hotel to check out. I got to the hotel at about 430 pm. To my extreme surprise my room was empty. I went down to the front desk and they told me that they packed my things for me. As in they THREW all my staff into the suitcase and brought the suitcase down to the reception. Toothbrushes and such all mixed in with closes. Really. What country are we in. Having travelled around the world I can say that not even in communist China you can get such a treatment.

Made a wrong decision when I decided to book a room at The Sunbridge Hotel Conference Center in Kitchener Holiday Inn still do not know what it is was not listed as a Holiday Inn on website even though their receipt has Holiday Inn heading. It was one of the worse experiences I have had at a hotel. Not knowing weather or not it was a Holiday Inn or a Sunbridge was my first mistake and also thinking it would be a nice place to stay was my second. The problem started the morning of August 15th when we went down for the breakfast I had paid 20 extra for. Thinking at that price it would include bacon and eggs and toast but what we received was totally pathetic. It was very small with cereal stale bread stale pastries a few slices of roast beef and a couple of other meats that tasted disgusting along with a few cubes of cheese and small servings of yogourt. Upon our arrival we were informed that there was no wifi available which was no big problem and they mentioned breakfast would be served up until 930 and we would sign for our breakfast but failed to mention that the kitchen was under renovations and that it was a VERY limited buffet. When I checked out I complained about this and it fell on deaf ears on top of that I was NOT charged the amount that I signed for or that what was CONFIRMED on my reservation. The reservation confirmation stated Room Rates Starting 08142019. CAD 1240Subtotal CAD 1240Total Tax CAD 2108Total CAD 14508 But when I got my receipt my credit card was charged 15332 again falling on deaf ears as they added more taxes than stated on a confirmation which is false advertising and I have contacted the better business bureau about this matter as the front desk agent would not listen to my complaints and was very rude and uncaring that I was so frustrated by that time I walked out I did not ask to speak to the manager again it probably would not have helped. I found this hotel not forthcoming with their problems and not willing to refund the extra money that I had paid for their so called 22 dollar breakfast. I really wish I had of kept my reservation at the Quality Inn where I have stayed before and they actually had a great breakfast well worth the extra money but they include it in their rates.
