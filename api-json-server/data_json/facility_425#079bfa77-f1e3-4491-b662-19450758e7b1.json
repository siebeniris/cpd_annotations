Just returned 2 days ago from The Lux Grand Gaube it is a beautiful hotel made special by its excellent staff. We stayed in room 3045 and could not fault it in any way the views were amazing great facilities and we were looked after very well by Kevina who always had a smile on her face and was keen to please at all times. The bed was huge and the sunken bath in front of the patio doors was an inspired idea. The hotel is so relaxing and from setting foot in the door you can feel your stresses slipping away My only main problem is that the 2 weeks went by so quickly. No matter where you were in the hotel there was always a helpful member of staff there to help you if you needed it or even just to have a friendly chat and bid you a good day. this even included the beautifully decorated spa style outdoor toilets where we often bumped into Esnac happily going about replacing the hand towels ensuring they were spotless etc. The food at the hotel is lovely with plenty of choice to suit all tastes. The relaxed atmosphere of the lunchtimes at the bar will not be forgotten sitting in the breeze overlooking a beautiful sea eating a super tasty chicken tika bagete cocktail in hand with Nina Brian and the bar team expertly taking care of your every need. Evenings were just as good with great service from Diren etc It was our first holiday in Mauritius and my thoughts before arriving was that there would be plenty of beaches snorkeling and boat trips akin to the Seychelles etc however Mauritius is certainly undersold by the travel industry. There is so much to do on the island that you would not expect that our time spent there was not only just about lying on a beach. My advice to anyone visiting is please take time to look at what is on offer with the Summertime Reps they are all really friendly helpful and so easy to get along with. You can even order a taxi with reception and book them for a whole day having a set price from the beginning they will take you wherever you want to go and wait for you throughout the day before returning you to the hotel. David at reception and his team are great for giving advice and manage to come up trumps every time. If you are taking a boat trip from the hotel I would strongly recommend going with Tom again he and his staff will tailor make your trip to suit you cook a barbecue lunch for you whilst on a secluded beach and take you to places where you are the only ones there for snorkeling etc. The amount of free water sport activities was also more than expected and certainly more than I have been offered at other hotels. A special hello goes to Joana in the lobby area who initially met us on arrival and gave us a tour of the hotel and its facilities a very nice lady who never stopped smiling throughout our stay. Leaving the best to last was Redo. What an amazing member of staff and the Lux are so lucky to have such an asset to their company I just hope that they appreciate him as much as all the guests do. I could have wrote this whole review just about Redo and what he has done for us over the last 2 weeks his attention to detail is amazing and certainly delivers the wow and oh la la experiences you will never forget. Redo is much more than a beach tender and we left the Lux with the added pleasure of gaining a true friend who we know we will meet again on return visits to Mauritius. We would not hesitate to recommended the Lux Grand Gaube to potential visitors.", "offset": [2143, 2243], "date": "2015-08-19", "cpt": "0", "category": "facility"}, {"id": 3, "uid": "23985798-8d38-4309-bba1-69ef5c7911d0", "sentence": "Excellent.

We have just returned from two weeks at this hotel. It is a lovely resort with plenty to see and do. We went all inclusive and there was an excellent choice of food and drink and the quality was very good. For some things a supplement is charged but be wary as some can be quite expensive. You have to book tables in the evening at two of the restaurants but the buffet one is just a turn up affair. The long trouser rule for men is rigidly applied but they are a bit more relaxed on the closed shoe front and many men wore sandals in the evening. They do not allow mobile phone calls to be taken or made in the restaurants but you can text and surf as much as you like. The hotel and grounds are lovely. They are clean and very well maintained. We had a deluxe room in the adults only wing. The room was spacious in good condition and was well serviced throughout our stay. This is not an adults only hotel so there were children about mainly pre school age some of whom were not always well supervised by their parents at meal times and crying infants in restaurants can be very annoying in a 5 star facility. We used the Spa and the Water Sports Centre regularly during our stay. The staff in both are really helpful and the equipment at the latter is in good condition. They do spa deals daily which are really good value. For UK visitors our standard three pin plugs work out there and the hotel provides a plug in mozie killer and also tea and coffee making facilities which are replenished daily. The red telephone box allows you to phone home free 3 minute calls only what a welcome feature. The free Wi Fi is everywhere in the resort in the rooms in the restaurants in reception and even on the beach. If you want to do trips there are loads both land and sea based which can be booked through your Tour Company or the hotel themselves. The staff are always smiling and very friendly. Service in the restaurants is excellent but just remember you are on holiday and apart from the self service buffet you are having a dining experience so it is not fast. In the Bar the service can be a little frustrating. It is not always very easy to catch a waiters eye when you want to order a drink or sign for what you have consumed. It can be a bit hit and miss on how fast you get what you want. I am unconvinced that the beach is really natural. The sand in the sea itself is less gritty and also a different colour than on the beach when the tide goes out. It also has a different feel to it. Because of this the water is not clear so you might want to consider taking reef surf shoes. We bought them out there and were much happier wading out in the cloudy water. Overall a great resort and a fabulous holiday which I would have no hesitation in recommending to others.", "offset": [1198, 1288], "date": "2016-01-25", "cpt": "0", "category": "facility"}, {"id": 5, "uid": "69212206-a397-4e01-ada7-7769bab5b56f", "sentence": "Honeymoon trip.

Our expectations of this holiday were blown out of the water once we arrived and saw first hand what a great choice we made to celebrate both my wifes and son in laws birthdays. it is location to the sea could not have been any better. The reception staff Ticia and Elena were very welcoming and made us feel very special on arrival and throughout our stay. We had our 7 month old granddaughter Sophia with us and all the staff made a big fuss of her she was the main reason why the staff always made a fuss of us. We booked a Junior Suite which was on the 2nd floor facing the sea which we were really thrilled with. The only hassle I found with the dining room was what choice I had to make on what to eat. the variety and quantity could not be faulted. Special mention must be made of Diren who really made a big fuss of Sophia spoiling her as he found out that she loved paw paw ensuring that every meal she would have her own plate full. He also got her to try mango. she took to it like a duck to water. Thus he was the first staff member that Sophia allowed to pick her up and ended up carrying her around the dining room showing her off to all the guests and staff saying that this is Princess Sophia. He was an absolute credit for the service he gave us. Swety and Rishi also always gave us top class service at meal times. Our suite was very spacious and relaxing. a big thank you to Clive and Provesh for top class service every day and their towel decorations on our bed waiting to greet us on our return were absolutely magical. Even the service on the beach and at the pool was excellent with Anop and Naiken always ensuring that we were always looked after. At the Boat House on the beach you can enjoy all the water sports including snorkeling glass bottom boat kayaks pedal boats long boards yachts water skiing scuba diving and windsurfing they even have a two seater water plane. Activities also include boules tennis table tennis gymnasium spa golf driving range and a library with a pool table and table football. Something everyone has to experience is the ice cream bar built in to a Mini limousine the ice cream is actually made at the hotel and special mention must be made of Ludiwyk on our first visit our daughter was disappointed to find that there was no banana ice cream yep you guessed it the next day banana ice cream was available. A truly unforgettable and magical holiday we know that we made the right choice with this hotel and that the service of all the staff is the best we have ever experienced.

Just returned from 2 weeks at the Lux. We were very impressed with the food service entertainment complex. Loved the a la carte restaurants the food quality and presentation was excellent. The buffet was also really good with some great veggie options. The macaroons were to die forThe service on the beach was a little hit and miss some days always found a sun bed though. The adult pool was a great temperature and also has beach pool service. Went on two trips one with Big John and the other through the Lux. The Big John one was in a little boat went snorkeling then saw some mangroves then on to a beach for a bq. The tide was out when we arrived on the beach and we found that we were only one of about 10 boats that went there. The little island was lovely but had a lot of litter around it and was a lot busier than we were expecting. The food was actually very nice we went as a group and were promised white wine which was not actually available. Once the tide came in we basically sat in shallow water till it was time to go. To be honest we had a great time but this was more down to the company than the trip. If you went as a couple I think it would have been a totally different experience and we would most likely have asked for a refund. The cost was \u00a3 60 each 6 of us. so quite expensive for what we got. I am a veggie and was pleasantly surprised by the veggie option. The second trip was booked via the hotel and entailed a minibus to the south of the island where we took a catamaran to see the Dolphins went snorkeling and then had a bq on board. This only cost about \u00a3 50 each and was very good value for money. The catamaran was lovely the service excellent the food and drink options were great except the veggie option which appeared to taste like warmed up Branston pickle with rice pasta and saladThe cinema options both indoor and outdoor were excellent the entertainment the best we have ever experienced on holiday. Only down side was how hot it was in some of the restaurants and bars. It was really income table some nights. Overall a fantastic hotel and would definitely recommend.

We went for our honeymoon. We spent 4 nights in busy Dubai for New Years and wanted a relaxing rest of the trip and chose Mauritius for 6 nights. When we first arrived the hotel it self was breath taking especially the foyer it was like something out of a sandals holiday advert. They greeted us with refreshments and took our details. We were then taken to our room which to our disappointment was slightly outdated and far from main reception and therefore had poor wifi signal. We requested a transfer to a room closer to the reception and was given a room immediately. This was a lot more convenient as the main breakfast bar and pool and beach was close by plus the wifi was a lot stronger. It was also outdated and dirty. We had to then call room service to re clean the room as the bed sheets were still dirty as well as the floors and bathroom. Although this was also done very quickly it was disappointing that this was not all done before we arrived. As we arrived late evening we had to order room service. We only booked bed and breakfast and the food in the hotel was very expensive. We would highly recommend booking all inclusive if staying in this hotel. The food is excellent and they have a big range of cuisine to suit all tastebuds including the banyan tree restaurant that served authentic Mauritius food which we did not really have a chance to try. The hotel has activities throughout the day to keep families and couples occupied. Although we felt the activities we not suitable for young couples. The best things about this hotel was the staff was very friendly the food was amazing the ice cream truck is a nice touch and all water sports activities was all inclusive except diving. The negatives were the rooms were outdated the hotel is very far from any restaurants outside the hotel and grand bay which is the main tourist area which was over 20 mins away. There is a lack of activities for younger couples. There is no other means of transportation except overpriced taxis. If you book these through the hotel make sure you haggle with them personally and not take the hotel price. It would be best to hire a car as this is the cheaper option. Overall our experience was good but when the 5 days were over we were looking forward to going home. This is a great hotel if you wanted a relaxing secluded holiday with a young family or your partner. The staff are incredibly friendly. especially Kawal Homesh Sandep and Mathieu and the food is amazing if booking all inclusive. The free calls home and wishing tree is also a lovely addition to the holiday.

I was a solo traveler on this trip to Mauritius and hence it was important for me to choose hotels very carefully. I read a lot of reviews before deciding on using this hotel for my recent short stay of 2 nights. I can literally not fault them on anything. You feel important and pampered from the moment you arrive. Even though I was alone I never felt lonely so I recommend it for solos and couples alike. Here is a summary because nobody has time for esaysRoms I received a surprise and complimentary room upgrade to a junior suite which is not cheap. but if I ever do get the chance to go back I would rather splurge and get the same room. It was exquisite views were amazing large patio with tanning beds pod coffee machine jacuzi with a sea view. Just the epitome of class. Activities Every day there is a full days schedule with different free activities to choose from so you will never be bored and it tends not to feel as cheesy and resort kitch as some other resorts out there. Everything just feels classy. Watersports I would recommend the glass bottom kayak. Very cool to feel like you are immersed in the ocean while staying dry. On a windy day the sea is not clear so you might not see fish though. There is also glass bottom boat twice a day pedalo snorkeling and a sea plane to take you on a scenic flight at an extra costService This hotel is all about the smaller details which makes the biggest difference. I will not divulge all the special things they randomly do for you but it will make you feel extraordinarily special and is what sets them apart from everyone else. Food Amazing food. Huge portions. Ice cream cart with seriously yummy ice creamLUX caf\u00e9 at reception which serves amazing flat whites. I am a self confessed coffee snob so I would never lie about a good or bad cup of coffee. Their baristas have been trained by Deluxe Coffee from Cape Town South Africa and they were clearly trained well. General atmosphere For some reason everywhere you go on the resort everything smells like a spa which is lovely. There are hammocks in random places where you can just chill at any time. The resort also has 2 cats which it seems might be part of a feral project which is great as such projects help keep rodents away. The cats are sweet friendly and well looked after and all resort guests seem to love them and give them attention but they will never bother you if you are not a cat person. I generally am very impressed by social responsibility and respect towards animals so this really impressed me and added to my good opinion of the resort. All in all totally deserving of their title as one of the top ten luxury resorts in Mauritius.

We stayed at the Lux Grand Gaube for a week at the end of June and were overall very impressed. The real high points are the range of activities available and included within your package eg Snorkeling barista training Yoga and cycling. Many of these we did and they meant that you really feel no urge to leave the resort which is a bit of a shame because the island is beautiful recommend 10 days minimum. The hotel itself is a firm 5star standard with some extra intangible features that really lift it and make it a unique experience. An example of this was the tree of wishes where you can leave behind an origami wish. Another example is the daily bottle hunt that gives guests the opportunity to win freebies if they find one of three bottled prizes placed around the resort. Food and drink are well catered for at the resort its breakfast being particularly broad in choice however get used to curry because it features quite frequently at the evening buffet. This is not a problem because you have the choice of at least 2 other restaurants every evening Abelone fine dining or the Beach Mediterranean. We went half board but ate lunch in the hotel most days and had drinks in the evening this worked out far cheaper than all inclusive so unles you are a heavy boozer HB is probably enough. Negatives and feedback for management. Very few but it is worth pointing out that drinks are really expensive at \u00a3 6 for a beer and \u00a3 350 for a coke. Other points were that the unheated pools were freezing and nobody was using them which is a shame because they looked beautiful. This may be down to us visiting in June and there were a very small heated pool and jacuzi in the Spa but it did not feel 5star. Final point is that some of people working at the resort seemed a bit tired and grumpy and I think were clearly working long hours.

My wife and I stayed at the Lux Grand Gaube for 2 weeks in September on an AI basis. We have visited Mauritius a number of times but this was the first time at the Lux. The resort seems to specialise in wedding honeymoon packages but not at the expense of other guests. As my wife and I are on the wrong side of 70 and fast approaching our 50th anniversary I can not comment personally on the above packages but what I can say is that everyone we met who had taken part in one was absolutely delighted with how the resort had arranged their special time. I feel quite jealous that this was not available when we got married. On arrival at the resort you are met at the entrance by a member of staff taken to reception and seated in a comfy chair and given a refreshing towel and drink whilst registration is carried out. You are then escorted to your room where your luggage has already been delivered a very impressive and efficient start to your holiday. You are then invited to take an orientation tour and I would strongly recommend this. The resort is quite large with numerous activities and if you miss the tour you will spend the next week trying to find your way around. The tour starts at reception and takes in the telephone box where you an make complimentary calls home the only proviso is that if someone is waiting then you keep your call to 3 minutes. It is then on to the indoor Cinema latest films and UK premier league football Gym Spa Games Room book exchange Steam Room Sauna Plunge Pool a small Infirmary Zumba Deck Petanque Archery tennis and Golf. It is then on to the coffee stand aforgato please double shot with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and then to the ice cream stand. This is an original stretch Mini and sits above the beach and is open 130pm until 6 pm and is operated by the ever smiling Roshni. It is then on to the adults only area that has a swimming pool a small beach the outdoor cinema and the Banyan restaurant and finishing at the water sports dive centre. Accommodation is in Superior Ocean Superior De lux rooms and various suites. Ocean Superior rooms are in an arc behind the beach and grassed area whilst the De Lux are in a U shape around the lagoon. They are all well equipped with ceiling fan air con and a well stocked fridge containing beer wine coke fruit juice and Pelegrino water. There is also a litre bottle of still water and they are all replenished daily. There is a kettle for tea and a rather snazzy coffee machine that takes the supplied pods. All rooms have a balcony or small terrace the De Lux rooms are bigger with a separate bathroom and a deep soaking tub. If you can afford it go for the De Lux room and it is definitely worth going all inclusive. There are 3 pools although we only have experience of 2. The adults only pool and beach is set apart from the main resort and are well served by an attendant. The main pool is large but has the bar on one side the main restaurant on another and the path running past the spirit room on a third so there are limited sun beds but there again this is a beach holiday. The beach forms an arc around the bay and is well equipped with sun beds in pairs under a fixed thatched canopy. They are well spaced apart so you do not feel intruded upon unles you want to talk to your neighbour. Once again the beach is well served by attendants and the bar opens at 9 am for those who feel the need. Offshore there is a buoyed line to stop watercraft from entering the swimming area. The water sports and dive centre are at the south end of the beach. I can not comment on the dive centre but the water sports centre is top notch. You can find all the usual such as pedalos kayaks wind surfers paddle boards and various sailing craft crew supplied if required as well as a glass bottomed boat and water skiing. Staff are friendly very helpful and with infinite patience to teach if required. They even got my wife up onto a paddle board well done. There is a safety boat on standby and they are on constant alert for anyone in trouble and are there instantly if they even think they are needed. A big attraction at the centre is a 2 seat seaplane that has now been joined by a 2 seat microlight on floats. My wife went in the microlight MR50 for 25 minutes and says it was the best money I have spent on her in a very long time she had a brilliant time and could even see turtles swimming in the sea. All resorts in Mauritius have sun sea and sand but I feel that the Lux is exceptional and stands out head and shoulders above the others for 2 reasons. 1. I have mentioned the staff at the water sports centre that are all without exception friendly cheerful and give the impression that their sole reason for being there is to ensure that you have a good time. This is equally true of all members of staff from the managers down to the gardeners and maintenance crew. Everyone greets you with a cheery good morning afternoon etc. and if you see them on a a regular basis in the bar or restaurant then they quickly get to know who you are and greet you by name. They can not do enough for you. On our first morning at breakfast my wife was wandering around the servery and was instantly approached and asked if she needed help. She said that she was looking for porridge and she was shown the porridge. She commented that it looked a bit watery and was told that they made it with water. She said that she liked her porridge made with milk. She was asked to return to our able and the porridge would be on its way. Every morning after that when we were shown to a table a member of staff came up to say that her porridge was on its way. This kind of service was not unusual it was the norm. Everyone gave their all to make sure you were hapy2. There are a number of restaurants at the resort. Breakfast is taken in the main restaurant and is buffet style and just about everything you could possibly want is available. When you are shown to your table you are asked if you want tea or coffee. My wife has tea and was supplied with a pot and a small jug of cold milk. I had coffee and was supplied with a cafetiere and a small jug of hot milk. This restaurant is closed for lunch and you take this elsewhere. The bar and Abalone restaurant serve the same menu club sandwich beef burger chicken burger panini etc and I had the best beef burger in the bar in a very long time. You can also go to the Beach restaurant where the food is mainly Italian inspired and apart from a very good steak serves pasta and pizza. Our favourite lunch time was at the Banyan in the adults only area. This serves Mauritian street food and apart from huge salad starters there is steak in BQ sauce thick ribs in a pineapple glaze fish curry octopus in sauce chicken fried rice and lamb in noodles. Make sure you leave room for pud my wife got very fond of the flambe bananas and they were delivered no matter what else she ordered. Dinner can be taken in the main buffet restaurant and each evening is themed from Indian Italian Mauritian Chinese and Around the World etc. The Banyan is closed for dinner and the Abalone and Beach have to be reserved but at no extra cost. The Abalone has an extensive seafood menu stir fried prawns etc with rice. The Beach once again serves mainly Italian based food and its nice to see the the large pizza oven in action. My wife says that she had the best seafood linguine ever and service in both restaurants is impeccable. There is a full program of entertainment in the bar in the evening. All resorts in Mauritius will have sea sand and sun etc. but the Lux Grand Gaube is exceptional because of the service and food. It would be impossible to mention any one person by name the list would be endless except Roshni everyone goes for ice cream because they all gave exceptional service. So if I could give a big thank you to Anabel Assistant Front Office Manager for presiding over such a superb team and to Reaz Food and Beverage Manager for ensuring a food experience second to none. It was not unusual to see Reaz still walking through the bar and restaurants at 9 pm checking to see if everyone was happy.

This was the first time at the hotel and second time to Mauritius. I will keep this brief. The staff are fantastic. The reason most helpful and friendliest staff I think that we have ever had looking after us on a holiday. There are too many to mention but heres a few. Nitisha sorry for the spelling. customer care and events thank you for looking after us re my 50th birthday. Wyford and Rishi at the adults pool area Jay and Ravi at the bar. also there were other bar staff whose names escape me as I write this one who talked to us about football V Rugby and another gentleman who serves the cocktails in speciality glasses. All the restaurant staff including Fahreim. The food is outstanding and varied. I love curries. these were the best. Our room was very spacious and clean with a wonderful view. The maid service was excellent. Our only concern was on the last night. All the children that happened to be at the hotel whilst we were there were all very well behaved and the parents appeared conscientious in looking after their children. However on this last night a new family arrived. The behaviour of the children left a lot to be desired. The children were running through the buffet areas and into the reception areas playing windmills. They were disruptive. The parents appeared to be oblivious to this and we can only assume this to be normal behaviour of the family. The staff tried to engage with the children. This behaviour seemed to be so out of place for the hotel. I can only hope that this was a one off and perhaps things calmed down after we left. The only other concern which is not the hotels concern but Thomsons was the transfer from the hotel to the airport. We were loaded onto a small minibus with other couples and luggage. The bus was far too small with absolutely no leg room. It was very cramped and made the journey hard work. in fact felt quite ill by the time we got to the airport. The driver drove well. steady no complaints about him. just the actual bus. All in all a fantastic holiday at a first class hotel. The hotel is due for refurb next year which will make it even better.", "offset": [1173, 1271], "date": "2016-12-09", "cpt": "2", "category": "facility"}, {"id": 15, "uid": "68c1334c-8f50-4342-b1bc-446ec5470dbf", "sentence": "This place is Heaven thanks to its wonderful staff. They are Family. Having had a wonderful holiday here last April we decided to drag our friends who we go away with every November to this wonderful hotel. We have been to some wonderful hotels around the world and when asked about the best of them Lux Grand Gaube is always listed as our favourite. So it was with some nerves and trepidation when we convinced our friends to holiday here. it is a long flight and it is quite expensive. However we need not have worried. Within hours Lux Grand Gaube had worked its magic on our friends and ourselves. The welcome from Coshna at the concierge actually recognising us from 19 months earlier was a lovely experience. In fact there are so many of the staff here from our previous visit and all of them remembered us I am taking that as a good thing of courseWe had emailed guest services with a list of restaurant bookings which is advisable if you prefer a particular time to eat and also requested adjacent rooms. Again we were in the Lagoon complex in rooms 109 110. Identical to last years rooms with a completely different view of the lagoon and out to sea. Still a magical view to wake up to every morning. Restaurants. Abalone is open for lunch and evening meal. The food is excellent and there is a great selection. However as there only 2 a la carte restaurants in the evenings after 2 weeks the menu can appear repetitive. However they will often offer a variation of the listed food as an alternative if you request it. We like to eat a la carte where possible but I must say the buffet was not a disappointing alternative when looking to have a change of routine. The Beach is open for lunch and evening meal. The food was again excellent with a great choice. Strangely we felt their afternoon menu had more choice and variety than their evening menu but again they were willing to do specials or requests if it was possible. The Buffet Restaurant is open for breakfast and evening meal. The place is beautiful relaxed and calm eating place in the morning. With Serge strumming his guitar in the background and an excellent range of food available whilst gazing over the pool and sea it is what holidays are all about. One criticism we have is that at lunch you can get tenderloin steaks on the all inclusive menu yet at night they attract a sizeable supplement. It does not make sense at all. BeachesWe used both beaches but much preferred the peace and tranquillity of the adult only area under the watchful eyes of Wyland Rishi and Vishnu. The main beach has the better sand and more spectacular view but having the pool to take an occasional dip in easily was important. Redo on the main beach is a top bloke. Always came to check we were ok always greeted us in the morning and if there was anyone or anything you needed to know he was the man to speak to. I would advise protection on your feet as our friend must have stood on a sea urchin and got some spines in his feet. Cafe Lux Satish and Nuah who looked after our daily caffeine requirements were awesome. Satish again recognised us from our previous visit and I swear that he also remembered how I liked my cappuccino with an extra shot. Amazing. It was always a delight to pass the time of day with them whilst waiting for our drinks to be freshly brewedReception We went to reception most days. Never to complain but mainly to get change for tips etc. It was always full of casual banter and chat. They all seemed so genuinely interested in you and wanting you to enjoy their hotel. They were always helpful. David the reception manager apart from being a top bloke as he is a Man Utd supporter has obviously gathered a team together who know how to make guests feel special. TripsI would recommend seeing as much of the island as you can. We did the island tour by private taxi. You have a fairly flexible itinerary to see Pamplemouses Gardens Troux au Cerfs at Curepipe Black River gorge national Park and Chamerel. Word of warning Thomson trips are quite expensive compared to what the hotel can arrange. They will claim theirs is exclusive and different but we did not notice much in the way of being different. We also did a trip to the mangroves by boat and then barbecue lunched on the island of Ile DAmbre which was relaxing and peaceful. The Island can get quite busy as many other boat captains have the same agenda. The staff are the hotels best asset and provided us with a fortnight of service enjoyment friendship and laughter. Nothing was any trouble they sorted any problems out promptly and with a minimum of fuss. I have listed the staff we had the most contact with during the fortnight. Some we saw everyday some several times but from the gardening staff cleaning staff up to the top management staff we spoke to everyone was friendly charming and made our stay so enjoyable.

Thanks Lux Grande Gaube for probably ruining every holiday for us from now onGodnes where do I startFirstly the staff are fantastic all of them. I will not mention individuals apart from a few outside the dining experiences and beach pools as it was a superb team effort by all. Starting with our wedding It was effortless thanks to Nitisha and her organisational skills. We were taken by the Lux chauffeur into Port Louis to arrange all the wedding legalities which took up a morning. The wedding day itself was arranged on the jetty with a fantastic meal that unfortunately was rained off towards the end so ended up inside but no big deal and was all good fun. Thanks to Nitisha and Ida for being our witnesses. We loved the whole experience and the honeymoon meal on the beach was stunning. We were also given a complimentary spa treatment and cooking class the latter unfortunately could not do. We sampled all 5 restaurants 6 if you count the burger shack. The food and service was simply outstanding. We have eaten ourselves and drunk ourselves silly. The Palm Court for breakfast was great with a staggering choice of food. from the bee hive honey smoked salmon to fresh fruit and amazing selection of cheeses. In the evening we loved the cooking stations the dim sum was a favourite as was the stir fries. This is not a buffet it is restaurant standard the only resemblance is that you have to get the food. You will not go hungry. The creole smoke house under the bayan trees was again excellent. The curry we had and the ribs were memorable as was the service. We loved sitting here for lunch overlooking the pool. Staff again superbThe Bodrum Blue location is fantastic on the water again food excellent and such a welcome every time we dined here. Loved the meze starters especially the humus. We often went for a drink here before dining at the other restaurants simply because the location overlooking the sea and cocktails were the bestInti restaurant was an extra charge on the all inclusive but we wanted to give it a try. Great service but was not blown away by the food should have been slightly better as it was not included in the package but in our opinion the food is just as good at all the other restaurants. Think our favourite for service with a smile and standard selection of food was Beach Rouge. Thanks to all the team you are all amazing and we loved itThe main beach was the best for us as it had showers and probably because it was next to the ice cream. Which again was outstanding. Running out of superlatives here. Service by all the team on the beach was first class from cleaning sun glasses to changing towels. The adults only beach nothing wrong with it and the service was just as good. We preferred the swimming pool here as much quieter than the main pool which might have something to do with children. You will not have to lift a finger on either the beaches or the swimming pools. The complimentary canap\u00e9s was such a great touch. No more food we kept sayingOn to the water sports we tried most from the kayaks to water skiing just had to put your name down. All included. And again great service with a smile. The spa was excellent and so tranquil we booked a couple of treatments here a must if you visit. Thanks for all the pre wedding treatmentsVikram was great golf lesson and then a round at Mont Choisey loved the course was probably a highlight of the whole holiday. Thanks Vikram for the game and will remember your tips on my swing. Such a great guy and will help improve my gameSo all in all one of those holidays of a lifetime. Thanks to all the staff at Lux you are all a great credit we loved every second and will be back I am sure especially when the gardens have had time to establish.

Where should I start. it is perfect. We were told that the hotel is about 80 booked but during the day there was plenty of space at the beach and enough tables in the lunch restaurants. In general it was quiet everywhere not even the buffet in the main restaurant was crowded at dinner time. There is an adult only area Banyan but also in the other areas of the hotel there were not many children maybe due to the time of our stay October. The whole hotel is simply beautiful and the location perfect. We were down in the south in a cheaper hotel for our first week of holidays and somewhat disappointed by the ocean color. Not at Lux. You do not need any filters for your photos here to get the holiday magazine look. I do not know how old the hotel is but everything looks new. Everything was clean and at no time of our stay have I seen some garbage lying around neither on the beach nor anywhere else in the hotel complex. Even the shared restrooms across the hotel area are always clean and smell of fresh mint. Our room. Marvelous. As far as we could tell all the rooms have an ocean view. We had a direct view of the main beach and the ice cream booth ici. Our room was spacious and contained a big super soft comfy bed two seats two small tables a desk with a chair and a big bathroom. The bathroom was divided into a separate shower two sinks and again a separated toilet with a bidet. We also had a small balcony towards the ocean with two chairs and a small table. The rooms are modern There are digital buttons next to the door which you can activate deactivate to signalize the usual do not disturb and please clean. Food. Oh yes. One of the reasons we booked here as we are food lovers. There are multiple restaurants with different opening times. Everything I have eaten at any of them has been simply delicious and I have usually high expectations when food is concerned. Moreover all of the restaurants are open and have stunning ocean views. My only pain point about the food in the Lux restaurants is that if you do not like seafood smoked stuff cilantro and goat cheese the menu choices are a bit limited. Breakfast and dinner buffet at the main restaurant Palm Court simply blew me away. They do not have honey for breakfast. They have 6 different sorts of honey. I liked the litchi honey the most. There are nuts yoghurts salads cheese different types of butter fresh fruit any type of juice you could imagine pancakes donuts cr\u00eapes sausages plenty of other salty dishes any type of bread which is usually still warm a cooking station where you can customize an Asian meal and much much more. If you want you can have ice cream for breakfast. There are 3 kinds of sugar on each table none of them labeled sugar instead carrying names like Light Muscovado which to this point I would have had no idea what it could be. Dinner is similar. The Asian cooking station is a constant. Then there is a pasta station where you can get ravioli spaghetti or penne with the sauce of your choice freshly prepared for you. They also make pizza though if you do not get it when it is fresh out of the oven it will cool down quickly as it is not made on order. there is still plenty of salad in the big walk in fridge where you also find any kind of oil you could want on it. Of course they also cook a lot of Mauritian food for the buffet so you get to try many dishes. The desserts are heavenly and there are plenty. Besides ice cream and muffins a small fridge in the sweet area hosts a daily selection of a least 5 different desserts changing every day. Apart from the main restaurant there is the Turkish Bodrum Blue where I can warmly recommend the PJ Kebab for its juicy chicken. We had an unintentional taste of goat with the Baklava for dessert though and made a mental note that original Baklava seems to include some goat product. Then there is the Beach Rouge with some focus on Italian dishesawesome truffle artichoke ravioli the BBs burger shack and the Creole Smokehouse for delicious Mauritian food. We only visited the Argentinian Peruvian Inti restaurant for its pisco bar a pisco sour drink as that restaurant is not included in any of the meal plans. Mentioning meal plans we were on half board which I think is the least you should book. The hotel complex is big enough to already discourage you from even attempting to go outside and if you do there is not much around. Meals are expensive at the hotel around 400 80 MUR for most dishes. Drinks are very expensive. I live in Switzerland and the prices at Lux easily rival the prices of cocktails in Zurich. If I remember correctly the full price of one pisco sour cocktail was 750 MUR about 20 The ordinary cocktail still has a price of about 13 You do not have to worry about water though. You can buy a bottle 075l I think for 110 Mur about 3 but we only did that when we had our meals at the restaurants. You get 2 bottles per day in your room maybe even more if you ask. Then there are glass containers with infused water at all beaches where you can get a cup of orange or lemongrass scented water or just plain ice cold water. The containers are frequently filled up with ice cubes so the water never gets warm. If you require a coffee the caf\u00e9 lux serves coffee shakes and in the afternoon desserts. Coffee is free in the morning during breakfast time for anyone who at least booked the breakfast meal plan. The same is valid for almost all drinks on the menu not just coffee. The selection is big you can have 3 different kinds of cold drip coffee a variety of milkshakes the regular warm coffee selection and matcha tea. No chai tea though which I would have expected. There are also a few fitness drinks which never free. We did not try any of them. Activities. You can do many of them for free. We tried a free yoga class kayaking standup paddling a glass bottom boat tour to the reef and snorkeling at a different reef. The water was not that clear and I have had better snorkeling experiences but we were told sometimes the water is clear. At the beach do not even bother to try snorkeling you can not see a thing underwater. My boyfriend tried and greatly enjoyed windsurfing which is free too but depending on the water level not always available as the water is very shallow until far out from the beach. There is a message in a bottle game 3 times a day I think at 9 am 11 am 1 pm which you should absolutely play. They hide a bottle you can go ask at the reception for a hint and if you find the bottle you win what is inside on the message. I have seen a girl win a 30 minutes massage and we won a package of the hotels care product line. The gym seems to have devices up to the latest standards as far as I could tell and there are multiple group sports activities during the day most of them free from aqua gymnastics over yoga and pilates to boot camp. There are tennis courts at the gym and a golf course close to the hotel. Entertainment in the evenings usually was not too exciting local bands playing at palm court mostly but I do not care too much about that. do not miss the traditional Sega event though which I guess is held once a week Saturday for us. We also joined the starry nights event where a clearly knowledgable guy pointed out stars explaining how the universe works answering questions and let you look through his telescope. Spread through the week during the day you can book a few crafting workshops and a barista workshop. there is a screen showing all the activities close to the main restaurants but you can also look it up in the Lux hotels ap as well as all the menus from the restaurants. Supposedly you can also reserve tables in the \u00e0 la carte restaurants for dinner which you need to do but that did not work for us in the apthere is a spa area which we did not use but I believe there are a free jacuzi and sauna. Massages and treatments are more expensive than at home in Switzerland so we passed on that. Now for the employees. I have never been treated with such warmth and attention in any hotel so far or by anyone who is not family or a very close friend for that matter. Throughout the day a lot of employees will smile at you ask if you are fine how your day is or if they can help you with any issues. If you are just standing somewhere looking lost after a few moments somebody will come and ask if you need assistance. Employees will expertly arrange your towel on the sunbed. They will put the napkin on your lap in all the restaurants. At the buffet they sometimes insist on carrying your plate back to your table after you filled it. The checkout was smooth. They booked us a taxi for 4 am and even packed a custom takeaway breakfast for us included in our half board plan. Last but not least I lost my shawl halfway during my stay and immediately upon notice went to the reception to ask if it has been found. It had not at that point but they told me they would notify me when it is found. Fast forward to the last day I again asked at the reception about the shawl. They then went to check everywhere while we went to settle the bill as we had to check out at 4 am on the next day. After we had paid we were informed that nobody had found my shawl. I was a bit surprised that the scarf was indeed lost as everything in Lux is cleaned up immediately by employees. It was not expensive I just liked it for its pattern size and warmth which I told the lady assisting us with this issue. But now heres what really astonished me They felt it was their fault that they could not find my shawl and insisted on replacing it. I told them that it is not necessary as it is totally my fault for losing it but it ended with me getting a simple big white cashmere shawl as a replacement at no cost for me. Yes you pay the price for all of this. it is expensive to stay at the Lux Grand Gaube. But it is worth it and I do not feel like I have paid too much. I have never spent more enjoyable more relaxing holidays in a place of such beauty.", "offset": [6898, 6970], "date": "2019-10-12", "cpt": "2", "category": "facility"}]}
