The staff was great at check in. We were laughing with them and they seemed to try to connect with us. They helped with directions to events we wanted to try while in Denver. The room was clean. The location was fabulous. The views from the spa were breathtaking. I would absolutely recommend this hotel. Next time I visit it will be with my wife on a weekend getaway. Location and views as well as just a great all around experience. Promenade skating rink was fun. Unser kart racing at the junction of US36 and I25 was awesome. The restaurants BJs and Dave and Busters. There were minor things needed attention about the physical structure but nothing except the ordinary maintenance.", "offset": [664, 778], "date": "2015-04-13", "cpt": "0", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "f9273043-89ee-4295-b9a5-45759e32ea38", "sentence": "Needs Some TLC. Hotel is in a great location in Westminster and looks good from the outside. The staff we met with and served us were great. The inside however needs some TLC. Not that we are clean fanatics but there is an expectation of a very clean hotel when the chain is a Westin. First off its not dirty. Not that we would not stay there again but would check the Mariot first. Heres what we saw 1 the patio outside is filthy. Food stains all over the ground. Including wherer you eat. Needs a good power wash. Weekly. And the sofas and chairs in this area were so dirty we would not sit on them. Too bad because it is nice out there 2 elevators were noticeably dirty especially in the corners indicating a quick vac only. 3 dirty glasses noticed on tables by the elevators for over a day. Separately we were put on the 2nd floor which not only is the pool access floor but also has meeting dining facilities. Hope the attendees do not order fish. And not for nothing but 11 day for wifi. And my bill says I earned 0 starpoints for this stay. Is that because I booked on Expedia. We had not stayed in a Westin for a while and if this one is representative. Like I said our staff interactions were all pleasant. Especially our breakfast waitress and the maintenance guy. Great restaurants in the area.

The staff were great and the building is very nice. Tub was a little outdated but the rest of the bathroom was modern and updated. No airport shuttle. Front desk recommended SuperShutle or a town car service. We opted for the town car service and booked through the front desk. Ended up costing 50 more than they told us it would. Restaurant was awesome. Served locally sourced food in traditional recipes for the areas culture. Only spent time at the conference center.
