I stayed here for about 10 days for work and somehow got a deal of 168 night. Given high Nairobi hotel prices this was a steal for a brand new hotel. The rooms are exceptional large functional modern. I did have a room that sounded like it was not fully sealed off from the outside as anytime any workers were near the back of the hotel where my room was it sounded like they were in my room. I could also feel and see the wind from the outside when I stood near one of my windows so someone needs to check the insulation. The pool still is not open and the Thai restaurant across the street would randomly close. The front desk and housekeeping on a few occasions entered my room or called even though the DND was on. That said this truly is a fantastic hotel in most regards. The gym is spacious and clean. These glitches I mentioned above will quickly get worked out in this first year of operations and I have no doubt that this will be a world class 5 star hotel in one years time.

Arrival was smooth and the room very nicely furbished and spacious. Everything seems to be brand new. The bed was also very comfortable. there is a few restaurants located in the same complex. Ate at the lobby restaurant where the food was good and service once again excellent. The waiter got one of the dishes wrong but very promptly apologized and provided us a free drink on the house. Proactive touch which sets top hotels apart. The lobby bar is also very trendy and there is a nice backyard hang around area. Breakfast had an extensive assortment of options. Service everywhere was attentive. Only very minor downside is the location of the pool which is adjacent to another building aprox. 3 minute walk from hotel. Also the checkout took a bit longer as the receptionist had to make a separate call to check my minibar consumption. a bit strangeAl in all the hotel has a cool and trendy vibe to it and everything is very fresh new.

It was the last weekend of Wimbledon and we enjoyed the ladies final on the sizable screen. We never got to use the mini bar but it was stocked. The meals in the SOKO restaurant were tasty. We enjoyed some Caiprinhas at the Zing Bar and the quality of the drink was just like they do in Rio. The Deverana experience was simply divine.

Restaurants and room service were good though they could use a little more variety across the different spaces food seemed very similar across the different restaurants. Hotel feels a bit more secure as it is tucked among office buildings and all floors must be accessed with a key card from the elevator. The only reason I did not give five stars is the lack of any green space and the pool is not within the hotel complex and seemed to be a hangout spot for trendy Nairobi hangout and people were smoking hookahs by the pool while I was swimming laps.
