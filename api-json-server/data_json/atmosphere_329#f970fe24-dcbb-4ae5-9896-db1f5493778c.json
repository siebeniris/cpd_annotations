I titled review pets allowed not friendly because dogs are permitted in your room and walk area only. Staff and other guests were so nice to us with our dog. Suggestion to management allow dogs in certain food service areas. Maybe the walkway by the pool so we can eat and relax outside our room. We had to leave the hotel for patio dining with our dog. Maybe designate a room in the casino to bring our dog. I was so disappointed that our dog was not allowed anywhere. Or allow dogs in the childrens pool area. To readers it was NOT staff they were so friendly. it is just policy. Overall we did not spend as much time as hoped gaming due to guilt of dog being left in the room. Also I read about a welcome package of dog stuff was not there for us. But I would not use we bring bowls treats etc. Our total experience was good. I would recommend staying here.

When we finally were able to check in the kiosk informed us that our room was not ready and they would email once it was. Close to 2 hours later I tried the check in kiosk again since I had not received an email and the line to see a human was still quite long and I was informed again that the room was not ready. I waited another 15 20 minutes and tried the kiosk once more and this time it gave me the option of upgrading my room for 20. I actually thought this was great and appreciated the ability to upgrade but as you will see it did not turn out so great. Also by upgrading it allowed us to get a room sooner had we not upgraded we would have needed to wait longer for the original room. We get to our room it looks decent. No complaints at first. It was already late and we were hungry so we checked out the room service menu. The room service menu has an All Day eating menu and me and my girlfriend decided we had go get something small at the burger place and come back to the room later and order room service. The menu said the all day menu is 12 pm 6 am daily. We ate and gambled. No complaints about the burger place. We enjoyed our meal and spent the rest of the evening gambling. Fast forward to 3 am and we are back in the room looking to order some room service. We find out that the all day menu that was supposed to go to 6 am actually ended at 2 am fair enough but do not put 12 6am daily in the menu book. We go back to the casino floor but no kitchens were open at that time. Ended up getting a flat bread and pastries from the bakery. They were alright but not the room service experience we were hoping for. Fast forward another hour it is about 4 am and we are ready to go to sleep. As we are getting ready for bed my girlfriend notices two bugs on the nightstand. One was rather large and long I have not been able to identify it from google searches. The other bug was a bed bug. An unfed 2nd or 3rd instar bed bug I did a lot of Googling. I called the front desk and was quickly told the room would need to be shut down and to come down to the front desk to get a new room. They did not seem surprised which makes me think this happens often. We get a new room and upon entering I do a quick inspection of the bed and nightstand for obvious reasons. When I move the nightstand I see a bug that looked like a fed bed bug slightly bigger than the last one. We immediately went back down and decided we had leave all together since neither of us were going to sleep very well thinking about the possibility of bed bugs biting us and laying eggs in our luggage. The front desk processed the check out quickly again not very surprised at the fact that we had two bed bug sightings in two different rooms. They processed our check out and told us there had be no charge and we left driving the 2 hours home at 5am. The next day upon reviewing my receipt I realized that no charge meant there were no additional charges and not that we had be refunded for our room. I called Harahs to complain and they quickly confirmed that they would refund me for the room they would not have if I did not call and I am still waiting for the refund to hit my card but I have faith it will.

Mind you my room what is a comp room so we only had to pay for Resort fees and taxes which totaled up to no more than 36 because we always go and stay and play and have fun. This experience right here was terrible I had to show him where all of that money came out of my account as well as speak to the manager on top of call my bank and stay on the phone with them for them to be able to speak to someone at the hotel but I was not the only one that this had happened to one of the other parties that I was with he overcharged them as well. Then when we were talking with the manager we overheard another couple complain about the same exact thing of being overcharged that whole weekend they were just over charging everyone I do not know if it was the same gentleman or if something was going on with their systems. Long story short we ended up getting our money back as well as an upgrade for our room but this should have never happened we checked in at 830 pm by the time all of this got situated and resolved it had to be like 10 at that point I just wanted to go to the bar and chill. And later on that evening I went to the front desk to go asking young lady questions about late check out the front desk manager her name was Kathy while I was speaking with the young lady she went and whispered in her ear do not give her any thing else. as if I had not already had enough issues a couple of hours ago and then at the same time there was another young lady next to me coming up to complain about noise from another room next to her she went and spoke to her she asked her how could she help her she called the people that the young lady was complaining about and told them if you make any more noise we are going to have security escort you out as well as she put a 50 credit on the young ladies room for the inconvenience. Now can you tell me when I went to go speak with the young lady I asked her just random questions about late check out and just letting her know about the issues I had already had why could not she had came and spoke to me and asked me what was going on and how could she help me instead she whispered in the check in reps ear just give her information do not help her or give her anything else as if they had given me something already. This was just a bad experience this sat very bad in my soul I had to file a complaint against her I felt as though it was a little discrimination going on but some people are ignorant to what they do and say out their mouth so sad we live in a world with these things still happening but I still love everyone and pray for everyone.", "offset": [554, 921], "date": "2019-10-14", "cpt": "2", "category": "atmosphere"}, {"id": 27, "uid": "5dc7a18e-c229-4c4a-8689-20e93d0c103d", "sentence": "Amazing resort must book.

After a very long trek from the parking garage we used the self check in kiosk and received the wrong room type. I went to the front desk and they told me the room was the same type as the one I had reserved. After getting off of the elevator we noticed an intense marijuana smell and walking in a wrinkled and dirty carpet we entered the room. It smelled like an old basement and was notably dingy. After noticing this we went to the desk and the manager told us basically that we would have to deal with it. She was extremely rude and did n\u2019t seem to care one bit about the smell. She did offer to \u201c deodorize \u201d it but refused to switch the room. After arguing for 10 minutes we decided to drive home as we did n\u2019t want to validate the experience of having to drive two hours to stay in a dump.
