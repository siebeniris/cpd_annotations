I like the Weston Prince Hotel I have stayed several times and the staff are very helpful and nice. The rooms thatI have stayed in are laid out nicely the beds are quite comfortable too. The lobby Lounge are very nice andproved a relaxing place to have a drink or meal. The only thing I found a little bit of a problem was the condition of the hallways rooms. The carpet was very tired should be replaced the desk TV stand in my room hadtrim that was damaged and peeling off the bathroom had small things like some peeling paint moldy caulkingand sloppy painting etc. Not enough to make me think I cared enough to complain but the small details that could be addressed and make the stay better. The views from the room were quite nice and I love being able topen a window and get some air in the room. It is also nice to have reasonable on site parking.

First forget that this is a Westin. It does not meet Westin standards although wth work this could be a fabulous property. The lobby is the most Westin lake and has beautiful views of the park like setting. The rooms are comfortable but carpeting bathroom fixtures lamps ventilation grills could use updates. Gym is small but fine and they have 2 tennis courts an outdoor pool deck and an outdoor whirlpool. Landscaping looks great but minimal maintainance and parking area needs repaving. Parking is easy and convenient but self parking is 25 night. Seems costly considering location etc. Rooms were clean and cleaned promptly each day but sometimes felt a bit haphazard eg. no robe the first day and the second day we got a complimentary bottle of water that we did not get before. Location is convenient to the Don Valley parkway but really need a car to get to public transport etc. Plenty of places to eat within walking distance and better places a short drive away.

The outdoor pool was very big and a great temperature. The hot tub was also really nice. The sauna was not hot enough. We did not use the gym but it looked like it had good equipment.

Asked to move rooms and told hotel was sold out so sorry. Air conditioner when on sounded like a jet engine and got too warm in room when shut off. Black mould in shower tub combo. Hot tub luke warm and sauna not hot enough. To add insult to injury someone kindly put a baseball bat through my windshield in what I thought was a secure gated parking lot. No cameras or patrol and off putting to hear from valet that this was the first windshield vandalized but they have had many tires slashed and have not been able to catch who has done the damage. A nice feeling that they have had a problem with no added security on site to protect their clients vehicles.

Our room was king size 1507. nice set up and even a balcony and great view. Sleep quality good and shower tub set up nice4. Parking is outdoors and yes there seems to be some issue with their automated licence plate system but it is no big deal as you can simply push the audio button and request them to open the gate5. Environmental. always a fail with hotels that promote meat and dairy in their restaurants top cause of GHG and wasted resources. They do have a typical generic statement about saving sheets by not requesting room clean on multiple night stays though but this is the least of the environmental concerns6. Food. we had breakfast at the buffet downstairs and while there was no hot entree vegan options typically disappointing not innovative there was definitely a large selection of fresh juice and fruit breads cereals and Almond milk non dairy was definitely available thank you7. Charging Station for Electric Cars like my familys BMW i3. well there is no charging station and not even a working standard outdoor a c wall outlet for me to plug my car into for an overnight charge. I even asked the front desk and they confirmed there was no option for me but to leave my family wife kids upstairs and go out for an hour or two to another location and charge my car at fairview mall or Ikea in the cold.

Any hotel where I sleep soundly earns an automatic four star ranking even though we were close to the elevators the separate hallway inside the room is sealed off by a second door which means you will not hear much from the outside.

The only problem is the automated parking system outside which will not let you in or out until it is read your licence plate.

Staff several of whom I have interacted with many times before were noticeably friendlier and upbeat. The less great news parking is now 18 a day a ridiculous price for a suburban Toronto location that has no alternative if you have to park and do n\u2019t like being ripped off. To add insult to injury the lot is full of potholes and is badly in need of repaving. The wardrobe in the room only has \u201c short garment \u201d hanging and a measly 5 hangers.

The girl at the front desk disappeared for 20mins before finding a room. This was being done in a near empty hotel with 8 cars in the parking lot ie not busy. They told me AFTER i checked in that there was no room service. When I arrived at my suite it was ice cold and had no phone. I had to call the front desk from my cell questions that they assured me would be returned shortly never were. On 2 different occasions i had to call back after waiting more than 1 2hrs. I finally went to the front desk where they told me that my only option was to take a lesser room for the night as the next day they were closing the hotel and moving me to a Best Western 20mins further from my destination at a rate that was 23rds less than what I had paid for.
