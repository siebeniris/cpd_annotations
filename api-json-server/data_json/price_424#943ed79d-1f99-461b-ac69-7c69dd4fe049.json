We selected this hotel for its convenience to family. It is in a good location with easy access to 51 and to lots of restaurants. Overall it is a perfectly fine hotel but there were some things that could be improved. First the website. The pictures of the rooms were great and I love the room layout view. But there is no full map of the resort layout so I could not really determine locations of everything. This became very important when I was trying to select my room online which is a wonderful feature. The site showed the hotel buildings but not in context with the rest of the resort casitas river ranch. So it was difficult to determine the view from the room I selected. Rooms. Our room was great and had the wonderfully comfortable bed bedding that I have found in other Hilton properties. However the towels while large bath sheet size seemed old thin as if they had been washed bleached many times. We had a 1 bedroom queen suite which I believe is the same size as the 1 bedroom king suite. The 2 queen beds barely fit into the bedroom. There was sufficient room between them but barely 12 inches between the side of the beds and the walls making it difficult to get in out of bed on the wall side. Also the bed stuck out slightly into the doorway. I think the king suite would be more comfortable. The living room was well appointed with sofa table lamps desk TV and bar area with coffee maker and mini fridge. The hotel buildings are surrounded by parking lots so the view was not as stunning as it looks on the website. We were on the 4th top floor thankfully as lower floors would hear cars and see car lights. Housekeeping We slept late daily and they never knocked on our door until we left Nice. I requested robes shower cap the first day and they were delivered the next day. Maintenance. We needed to have a light bulb replaced and the sink stopper fixed. They responded quickly. River Ranch. We walked through this as it was a little too chilly to sit by the pool in the sun. They were still doing maintenance to prepare it for the season and the restaurant was closed until the weekend. This area looked like a great place for families. Food We ate breakfast at Ricos and it tasted fine. The service was excellent and the place looks like it would be fun in the evenings. My room service dinner was fine they even called to confirm the size of tea pot number of tea bags I wanted. But 22 gratuity plus a service charge seems excessive. Overall the hotel met our needs the price was good and we had no real complaints.

The lazy river is fairly short though so after we floated around 3 4 times we got out. They have a putt putt golf course which we did just for fun. They also had tennis courts and a basketball court.

We traveled to Phoenix over MLK weekend. We stayed for four nights in a Casita. We tried both restaurants the pool the spa the gym and the gift shop. I was not quite sure what to expect other then a break from the Kansas cold in January. I was completely overwhelmed and wanted to stay longer. And not just because the beautiful weather. My six year old love the pool my spa experience was outstanding. I received the pressure point massage and my hips have not felt that loose in a long time. The spa was reasonably priced. The gift shop was really cute and also reasonably priced compared to other resorts we have been to recently. We all loved the breakfast buffet and all staff we encountered throughout the resort were amazing. I enjoyed The relaxed family atmosphere. We did venture off resort a couple of times to go hiking. Go early for a parking space. Finally one of the most amazing things about our trip was the honesty of the staff. I neglected to empty a drawer including about four to 500 worth of swimwear.

Nicely maintained serene property. Adjacent River Ranch waterpark offers relatively low key family fun in the sun. Friendly staff super nice housekeepers. We had a spacious casita clean and well appointed. Nice to have an upper level deck very relaxing. The kitchenette was not that well equipped plastic utensils and styrofoam plates bowls provided but lacked microwavable table ware. Went out to buy an inexpensive roll of paper towels which took on double duty as paper napkins as well as for general eating in room clean up. Snack bar and sundries shop in the waterpark were handy if slightly pricey ofsite food not allowed in the park. Both on site restaurants seemed overwhelmed the couple of times we poked our heads into there seemed to be a shortage of wait staff. I have done a separate review of the Hole In The Wall restaurant that is on the property. Recommend off site restaurants drug stores and super markets as better value dining drink options. There is a nearby Sprouts organic grocery store on 16th Glendale a less than 5 minute drive that offers a nice in store deli. Walgrens drug store is across the street from the Sprouts complex. If you have kids who use the waterpark facilities or miniature golf course every day the 22 mandatory resort fee is worthwhile particularly when you consider the daily resort fee is inclusive of wifi access. I am not sure this is the best couples resort but can not quite say since we did not check out the spa tennis court or exercise facilities.

There was a ton for kids to do including a lazy river water slide pool volleyball bean bag toss mini golf basketball court and more. The pool bar menu food service was pretty good and what you would generally expect for options and prices at a resort. Our room had a nice balcony with a terrible view of the laundry maintenance area. I am not sure why they even put these balconies on the rooms it just seems like a poor design of the hotel. Also the sheets on the pull out couch had stains and food in them when we first tried to use it but they came immediately to change them for us. We had dinner at Ricos one night. it was ok as far as atmosphere service food. I would probably try something else next time like Aunt Chiladas down the street but it was convenient and met our needs. We stayed here because the Hyat in Scotsdale was sold out.

I m sure every 2 queen room dosent have that moist smell i just hope that the next go round i get one without an ominous smell.

Pros I was hesitant about staying here due to a lot of the bad reviews but decided to give it a chance. we stayed in the south pointe room which had not been renovated yet only north pointe has been renovated. It was not as bad as the reviews said. Yes it could use updating but it was clean and perfectly fine. The property itself was clean. Everyone was very friendly. Cons. The place is like a maze very confusing to navigate. They lack restrooms. There is only 1 bathroom stall in lobby. Only 1 bathroom stall at each pool and then at the River Ranch up front where most of the crowd is there are only 2 stalls. They do have another bathroom showers but that is all the way in the back of the waterpark that we did not know about until the last day and did not want to have to walk that far to use a restroom. The food was horrible at all 3 places hole in wall ricos and slim Pickens and they were very overpriced. the shower at the pool had one temperature freezing. and finally I never charge anything to my room. I always use a credit card to keep track of my charges. Rodeo Drive the gift shop charged me twice when I only ought something once front desk ending up taking off that charge from the hotel bill but now that I am home going through my credit card charges I see that every single restaurant charge breakfast lunch and dinner does NOT match my credit card receipt. They overcharged each one by a few dollars. That is completely unacceptable as I have the credit card receipts when I charged the food showing exactly what I paid so why they feel they could add money to it is beyond me and now I have to take the time to call my credit card company and dispute these charges.

Overall we were extremely disappointed with our experience. When we initially arrived and checked in the staff were friendly and anxious to orient us to the different features of the resort however our experience quickly declined. When we arrived at the elevator the guest service staff had directed us to the elevator was out of service. We were left carrying our luggage up an exterior stair case in 105 deg weather. As we arrived at our room the furnishings were dingy and outdated with the carpet being gray and worn. We quickly discovered food residue on the desk phone as well as a mini fridge that was not working. Because we had purchased food and snacks for our 3 day stay we were particularly concerned about our food spoiling. Lastly the carpet from the bathroom to the bedroom was tattered and unraveling. When the maintenance staff arrived with a replacement refrigerator smaller in size than the one originally in the room. we pointed out the worn carpet. After taking a picture of the problem we were reassured someone would come and repair the carpet. The next day we had heard nothing from the hotel about the worn carpet and I had accidentally stepped on a nail sticking up from the strip intended to hold the carpet in place. After returning to the registration area and requesting to talk to the hotel manager I was able to visit with one of the shift managers who agreed to upgrade our room and send a bell man to help us move. The upgraded room was slightly more modern than our original room and we were grateful for the free upgrade however once we unpacked at the new room and I sat down to follow up on a few work items I was surprised to find my internet connection was extremely poor 20ms ping. For the next several hours I tried working with the internet tech support team and the outsourced internet tech support staff in San Diego with no avail. I finally tethered my laptop to my cell phone for a reliable internet connection. Lastly as we received our final bill prior to check out we noticed an extra 75 charge from the restaurant attached to the resort. We had not visited this restaurant. We were able to get this charge removed after several follow ups but it provide one more example of systems and processes at this hotel that are not working well. The allure from the pictures of the water park and of the pools is what drew us to this resort. I would hope that others experiences are better than ours however based on problems we experience in several different aspects of the hotel operations I would not recommend staying here.
