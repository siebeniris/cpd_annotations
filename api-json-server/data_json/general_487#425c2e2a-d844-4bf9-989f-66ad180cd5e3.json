They were doing construction so the pool was closed which I expected but did not know until I showed up that their gym was under renovation. While they did offer gym access at their sister hotel across the street it was annoying seeing as I had to bring warming layers because it was in the 30s every morning. 2. My fridge would work on and off at its own discretion causing over 50 in groceries to go bad. I just ended up not using the fridge and ate out for every meal which added up over a 6 night stay. 3. They happened to do some construction mid afternoon one day and it sounded like there was a jack hammer working near my room. Not sure if it was just the timing on my part but it would be a concern if you had odd working hours during your stay. I decided that I would not nap that afternoon and just stayed up with the TV on blast to drown out the noise.
