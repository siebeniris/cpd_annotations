I got a good cyber Monday deal on their website. The rooms included self parking internet and also breakfast buffet for 2 per room. I booked 3 rooms. The location of the hotel is walking distance to a Starbucks and some restaurants. When we arrived Jasmine Z greeted us with a smile and cookies. We had requested rooms facing the courtyard which were pretty quiet. The rooms were clean but a little dated. The walls in the rooms are pretty thin. You can hear the flushing of toilets and people showering. Also there are not blackout curtains in the rooms just blinds. There was mix up with our breakfast buffet at Jacks. The two girls Ashley and Karina were not very friendly and were too busy chatting with each other rather than helping me with the issue. I went to the front desk and Raj at the front desk was great. Super friendly and helpful. He quickly solved the problem with Eric the restaurant manager who was also apologetic and quick to get us seated. We enjoyed our breakfast at Jacks. Linda the omelette maker was amazing. So cheerful and patient taking our requests for our omelettes. We had great service from Pepe our waiter as well. This is a dog friendly hotel so beware if you do not like dogs. I am giving it an average rating because of the thin walls. If you are a heavy sleeper than you probably will not have any issues.", "offset": [831, 892], "date": "2015-01-13", "cpt": "0", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "ccb95e70-9ecf-4610-abaa-40ce021f922f", "sentence": "Just a Few Steps Away. The hotel is within easy walking distance to the wharf and downtown Monterey. In addition the walking bike trail along Cannery Row and Pacific Grove is directly out the rear entrance. The valet bell staff is friendly and very helpful. They are very knowledgable about eateies attractions etc. and can provide helpful suggestions. They are geniune in their greeting and truly interested in making your stay enjoyable. The front desk staff are pleasant and make quick work of thw registration and check out process. The rooms are nicely appointed and maid service is attentive. The walls seem very thin at times. Guests wandering the halls as they return after an evening can be heard walking and talking for quite a distance. I believe most rooms have a small refrigerator that easily holds soft drinks and small containers. This hotel is connected with the Monterey Conference Ctr. so it can be busy and often very full.

We booked 1 night for a quick trip to Monterey and Carmel the next day for lunch. The Hotel had many many pluses especially that it was pet friendly. Upon check in we were given a doggie treat for our dog and two freshly made chocolate chip cookies for my husband and me. Our room was lovely clean and overlooking the front courtyard and the wharf nearby. The shutters In lieu of curtains was perfect. The bedding and pillows beyond comfortable. Our deck with two chairs fabulous. And since we were exhausted we ordered room service and watched the Sharks game on TV. To our surprise the room service dining was wonderful the food fresh and hot. The presentation met all our needs and we enjoyed our dinner. The room was quiet and after the game we went into a deep sleep. So after all the wonderful experiences we were bummed to be woken up by a worker with a pressure washer cleaning the brick outside our window and deck. Yes we were woken from our deep slumber by a pressure washer and were given no notice to expect any work outside our room. When I mentioned it to the front desk as we were checking out the front desk clerk did not have a clue that someone was working outside.
