My boyfriend and I recently travelled to the Sheraton Park for a Disneyland weekend trip. We had stayed here previously as Club Level guests which was wonderful but this time we had pre booked a standard room. 1. The Room We had some issues with the room assignment process and Alejandro at the front desk acted quickly and professionally to resolve all of them. What happened was that we were given a room on the ninth floor 918. four levels directly below the Club Lounge where construction is ongoing note all other refurbishments are now completed except the Club Lounge. It was about 330 PM and we could hear hammering and such. It was also an adjoining room note. ALL KING BED rooms are adjoining EXCEPT those on the Club levels. We returned to the front desk and were given a pool facing room on the 12th floor. This was much quieter until the party on the 14th floor above us decided to have a large gathering on their deck around 8 PM. We returned to the front desk and were given a new room 144 14th floor corner room pool facing. It was at the far southwest corner of the floor and was blissfully quiet. Thank you so much to Alejandro for the consistent professional and accommodating customer service we received. 2. Room Service We enjoyed three breakfasts to the room compliments of our resort dining gift card provided in our Westjet Vacation Package. The meals were delicious and all arrived within 30 minutes. There is an automatic 20 gratuity that can not be placed on the gift card. 3. Noise None as previously stated corner room on 14th floor. Once housekeeping started going around 10 11 AM then you hear the carts and hand held radios in the hallways. 4. Theme Park View Not from EVEN numbered rooms only odd numbered north facing rooms. But our room being on the corner had a tiny little extra west facing window that we could see DCA from. 5. Overall Definitely worth the experience of staying on the Club Floors 12 and 14 which are all refurbished and well appointed. Great front desk staff absolutely so grateful for the outstanding customer service provided by Alejandro during our stay.", "offset": [1918, 2043], "date": "2015-01-15", "cpt": "0", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "0c970db0-b899-4001-8059-5af526ced9ae", "sentence": "OK hotel needs renovations. Recently stayed at this hotel for a visit to Disneyland. It is ok but public areas and rooms need updating as they are old and look shabby. We first got a room facing the pool but late at night the generators of the Hilton next door started running and were so loud that it was impossible to sleep. The hotel moved us to another room facing the resort which was more quite. Great service in the middle of the night. Unfortunately check in was not great. When we arrived there was one lady handling a line of 15 guests. When every guest was taken care of including us after more than 15 minutes two more staff members arrived and all three had nothing to do. Breakfast was ok at the temporary lounge area so were evening canapes and drinks. Everything a somewhat older Sheraton can be.

This time we upgraded to club level and we really enjoyed the club level amenities a lot. I asked for a quiet room and that is what we got.

The rooms and central HVAC system are not up to todays standards rooms are very small but this is not the hotel staffs fault. They do their best with what they have.

My mother and I stayed at the Sheraton Park in the first week of June for a mother daughter getaway. This was my third stay at this hotel and I had had very good experiences in the past. We had booked a 2quen bedded Club level room using Expedia and when I called to confirm the reservation directly with the hotel I learned that the booking had come through as 1 King. they changed it in their system immediately. Always check with the hotel itself if booking through a 3rd party like Expedia. While we had requested a Disney view room we learned that there was a USD30 night upgrade fee in addition to the Club fee. I requested this as well so when we arrived it was already added to the bill. We checked in at 3 PM and had a lovely Disney view room on the 14th floor the highest floor that was well away from the elevators like we had asked. Carlos at the front desk was extremely kind and helpful during check in. it is an easy walk to the Gardenwalk where we had dinner at California Pizza Kitchen yum. The walk to Disney is 15 20 minutes depending if you make the light at Katela and South Harbor. For two adults this was do able but those extra 13 km at the end of the day at Disney can be a lot for tired feet. The Club Lounge at the Sheraton recently finished its refurbishments and it was a very nice place to have breakfast and evening snacks drinks. When I was here in November they had a much nicer selection of baked goods for breakfast ie. Fresh breakfast loaves like banana loaf. and now they have sad little pastries that are nt very appetizing. They also have fresh seasonal fruit cereals toast and bagels oatmeal Starbucks coffee Tazo teas and even Soymilk for dairy free guests. it is basically a continental breakfast that gets you through the first 3 hours of the morning until you can have brunch or lunch somewhere in Disney. The pool area is very nice and clean with beautiful foliage and vegetation planted around it gives a more resort feel than some of the other hotels in the area. We were mainly here for Disney and we appreciated having a clean modern room with a lovely view of Disney and the surrounding area of Anaheim. Our room was very quiet which we needed after the long days. Keep in mind that there is construction happening just north of the hotel and west of the Springhil Mariot. There is also construction happening across South Harbor and both get going at 7 AM Mon Sat. If you do not need a Disney room than the pool view rooms will be quieter. Also unles you are going for a high up Disney room ie. Floors 10 and up. I imagine the construction noise would be more intense. Request highest possible floor and east end of the tower to get as far away from the construction as possible.", "offset": [1249, 1391], "date": "2015-06-13", "cpt": "0", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 9, "uid": "c0923627-9a46-47ba-96e1-9695326ab31d", "sentence": "Excellent Hotel Location. My stay at the Sheraton Park Resort was from November 3rd to November 17th 2014I will begin by saying that overall I\u2018l go into a bit more detail shortly my experience at this hotel was excellent. This was due in no small part to the staff. Practically every member of staff I spoke to or dealt with was incredibly friendly helpful would make every effort to ensure my stay was perfect. Also the room was pretty good as were the restaurants the bars the pool. So some details. At check in I was greeted assisted by an incredibly wonderful woman. Apologies that I ca n\u2019t remember any names. Sorry. I had contacted the hotel in advance with a ridiculous list of room requests full balcony high floor non connecting king bed etc this has to be the first time at any hotel that the check in clerk not only found these requests but spent a fair amount of time trying to accommodate every one. She checked many rooms before finding one that suited me was even gracious enough to apologise that she could n\u2019t meet every request. The only one being it was n\u2019t a king bed but that \u2019s no deal breaker to me. She was also kind enough to upgrade me to a Disney View room at no extra cost which was very generous. The icing on the cake however was the special promotion the hotel was running at that time which gave a certain amount of dollars per night of your stay to each room to use in the hotel restaurants bars. Although not in the gift shop nor the coffee shop which are independently run. Due to the booking I had made I received 350. It was a great start to my holiday gave a fantastic first impression of the hotel. Once I got to my room I was very pleased. It is to be honest a fairly standard business type hotel with the usual facilities. But everything was in good repair clean. The bed was comfortable the tv large the bathroom fine. It also featured a small fridge had a decent amount of storage. The large balcony with two chairs a small table was a lovely extra a great place to have a nightcap. As for wifi see my later comment. The standout feature of the room was a simple thing the pillows. They were to put it mildly incredible. They were perfect I \u2019ve never slept so well. I \u2019ve been desperately trying to find out if I can get these pillows here in the UK but have n\u2019t had any luck so far. The lobby bar was small but functional although for some reason very underutilised by other guests. I was often the only patron in there. The pool bar was usually busier also served good food at decent prices in huge portions. All the bar staff were without exception excellent. Friendly chatty made me feel very welcome. The pool area itself was fine. The pool is not large but was well equipped with plenty of chairs tables loungers umbrellas. There was a small hot tub rest rooms plentiful free towels. It too was kept spotlessly clean. I also ate in both of the two onsite restaurants Mollys Kitchen the Western themed one who \u2019s name escapes me. The food was excellent massive portions a decent selection. But again the stand out feature was the staff. I have never been made to feel more welcome in any restaurant. Simple things like remembering greeting me by name made a big difference I had some great conversations with the staff. I was genuinely sorry to say goodbye to them when I left. They even offered advice on what to do when I injured my knee where to go what to buy plus they asked me in the following days how I was if I was recovering. Remarkable. As for the other staff I encountered they were again without exception excellent. A particular mention to the valet who despite the fact I did n\u2019t have a car so never actually used his services greeted me every day towards the end of my stay started making me laugh every day with his quips such as \u201c Do n\u2019t you have a home to go to \u201d. And \u201c Are we never gon na get rid of you \u201d. Apparently not many people stay there for as long as I. Finally one day I declined housekeeping as I had injured my knee so stayed in the room all day. Then a short time later the front desk called as they had been advised by housekeeping I was injured to check if I was ok told me if I needed anything at all just to give them a call they would help. That is incredible customer service. The hotels location is also good. It took me around 15 minutes to walk to Disneyland but with the ART bus stop literally being at the hotel running frequently I used that for the rest of my stay. It is n\u2019t free but well worth the nominal amount. Also by the hotel is a large CVS which was considerably cheaper than the small store at the hotel an IHOP opposite. Slightly further at a 10 minute walk were several restaurants at the Gardenwalk including Chescake Factory Buba Gumps PF Changs plus a few more. The Gardenwalk itself was a bit of a ghost town. The vast majority of shops were empty with only a few open. I was told it had just been taken over by new owners so hopefully it will get busier. For now the few restaurants are worth the trip but do n\u2019t go there if you want to shop. So that \u2019s all the good stuff. Here \u2019s a few not so good along with some pointers if you are thinking of booking here. First biggest. Wifi is a shocking 1495 per day. That \u2019s a ridiculous amount to charge not to mention the fact it should simply be free these days. Enough said. Housekeeping. Whilst the room was cleaned ok some days it was obvious that there was not much attention to detail. It was never that the room was dirty but that at first the room looked like new tv remote moved phone cable tidied balcony furniture arranged etc but as my stay went on it seemed like the room had been given a quick hoover towels changed nothing more. Again not the end of the world but just a minor thing. Also my journey to the hotel from the UK had been a long one on arrival I had a few shirts that I needed ironed. I know this is always expensive I am normally happy to pay it. Usually as I just need the shirts pressed there is a reduction in the fully laundered price to account for this. At this hotel though I had to pay the full price for a laundered shirt. I know for next time but be warned. Plus because I had charged this laundry to my room aprox 100. the hotel put a hold of almost 500 on my credit card to cover \u201c future incidentals \u201d. Apparently this was because I \u2019d charged a large amount on my first day. The hold was removed after but I was still shocked by it. Pay for laundry in cash at this hotelFinaly whilst I was incredibly lucky with the room I received I noticed there were several rooms that would have not made for a pleasant stay. In particular on one side of the hotel the rooms on the ground first floor look directly into the car park. And I mean directly. You have your room then a patio then a car parked right there. Headlights would shine straight into the room exhaust fumes would too. I would have refused to stay in one of these rooms period. Be aware of this when you book. In summary despite a couple of hiccups I had a fantastic stay at the Sheraton Park Resort. When I did encounter a problem the staff made every effort to resolve it just their attitude friendliness helped. And to me that \u2019s the sign of a good hotel stay. Sometimes small things can ruin a holiday but this hotel its staff stopped this from ever happening turned the negatives around made it a fantastic stay. I would n\u2019t hesitate to stay here again I \u2019m in fact currently planning to do so. And find out where I can get those pillows fromBut I still wo n\u2019t pay that much for the wifi.", "offset": [1764, 1804], "date": "2015-06-15", "cpt": "0", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 10, "uid": "a8364303-ba69-4f1d-9ed3-16c6e568b278", "sentence": "Beware of cockroaches on steroids.

After I went to the front desk to complain the building maintenance manager came to the room and proceeded to tell us that because of the 1 strip between the doors to the room and the hall it is impossible for them to keep the water bugs as he called them out. He said they spray and have pest control come often but they can not get it under control. The maintenance manager was very unapologetic and could not understand why we were so upset. After finding the bug in the bathroom we started to notice more bugs in the outside common area between the pool area and the entrance to the tower where the rooms are. This was very unsettling and despite long days at the theme park it made sleeping near impossible. We had to barricade the doors in the suite and the adjoining room doors with towels hoping that was enough to keep the critters out. It really was just awful.
