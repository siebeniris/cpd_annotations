The mattress was so hard I opted to sleep on the couch. All that for about 300 night. For this price you also have to pay more for Internet service in your room. They have a great workout facility but it costs 15 day or 25 week. There were charged for everything and it gets tiring being nickeled and dined to death.

There is a pool bar as well but we noticed other families brought their own personal coolers with drinks. Great idea as this did not seem to be an issue for the staff and of course much cheaper. There is a grocery store right next door to the hotel so drinks and snacks can be bought there. We drove so we parked our car at the hotel for an extra 55. Yikes. We did notice that there is a parkade next door that was much cheaper. Worth checking into. As for our room. Great beds air conditioning lots of space and a window bench to take in the view. We were in the 19th floor so what a view we had. There is a snack tray from hotel so be sure that children do not touch it or you will pay an enormous amount for your snack.
