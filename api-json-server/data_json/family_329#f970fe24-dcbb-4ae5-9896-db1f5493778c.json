We stayed for 2 nights and for the most part everything was excellent. Check in was a breeze and took less than 5 minutes. The front desk clerk was very cheerful and efficient. Our room was in the Bayview Tower on the 6th floor. The room was tidy and in relatively good shape. The view was not great but that was not a problem for us at all. Housekeeping did an exceptional job and the housekeeper was also extremely friendly and courteous when we saw her in the hallway. We had bagels and coffee at Caf\u00e9 Taza in the lobby for breakfast. Not great bagels and very overpriced. The Waterfront buffet was excellent as usual for Sunday brunch and worth the price of the meal. We saw the Divas in a Mans World show Saturday night and really enjoyed it. The showroom was really nice and comfortable and all seats looked like good seats. Our only complaint was with the pool. The pool is indoors with a really nice party vibe with a DJ and bars etc. We wanted to relax and take the sun so we chose the outdoor sundeck which was upstairs also with a bar food hookah and DJ. The problem was with the music it was so loud for a relaxing day by the pool. It was actually so loud that my body was vibrating from it and my head started to pound. There was no relaxing to be had there and even a conversation took effort because we found ourselves screaming at each other to be heard. Also an important thing to note is that there were less than 10 people on the sundeck and the ridiculously loud music really does not belong there. Since there is a DJ at the pool itself Harahs should consider having a more peaceful atmosphere for the outdoor sundeck area. People started to leave as soon as the DJ started to play shortly after 120 noon. We left 2 hours earlier than we had originally planned. The pool itself was very nice with perfect water temperature. The hotel was quite crowded this weekend so that a hopeful sign for Atlantic City.

Beginning at check in and including the Total Rewards desk pit bosses and dealers. We had some comps that had been mailed to us and that is where I have a complaint. My comps included a 300 reward points birthday gift and also a 25 restaurant credit which we had also received on previous trips. Although instructed to merely swipe my card to get these rewards when I did so nothing came up on my account. Waited on line for about 15 min at the TR desk. I was given two instructions 1 swipe my card and play a slot machine and my 300 credits would be added to my account it worked but it would have been helpful to know that ahead of time. and 2 I was told to charge a meal to my room and the 25 restaurant credit would be deducted at checkout. I questioned this because in the past I had always received a voucher but the gentlemen insisted that he was giving me correct info. When we checked out you guessed it no credit. I went down to the desk explained my situation and was told that I was given incorrect info. I should have received a voucher. Luckily I had the mailer to show that I was entitled to the credit. The supervisor was called and graciously gave me the credit off my bill but told me in the future I would have to get the voucher. Okay so what am I supposed to do. If the people at the TR desk do not know what they are doing how would I know that.

In fact it was my first trip to AC in over 20 years.

Upon calling the front desk we were informed that there was a problem and that they were working on the problem. Three hours later the problem was still not fixed and after much complaining we were switched to the Harbor Tower without bell desk service because we were informed that room to room transfers were a non covered service by the bellmen. The food which seems to be a common theme today was overpriced and underwhelming. Be prepared for 450 per person dinner buffets although it was better than most overpriced buffets I have visited over the past several years. Now on the positive side. The casino dealers and pit bosses I encountered were extremely friendly and accommodating. Comps were relatively free flowing without the Vegas swipe your card comps. The drink service was hit and miss until you found a cocktail server who actually wanted to be tipped then the drinks flowed like water. There is also a free shuttle that will take you to boardwalk properties. Just a side note. If you or someone in your group is traveling by wheelchair be prepared for a long wait. We received everything from The wheelchair lift is broken to The wheelchair lift that works is on lunch break. Every time we traveled one round trip for three days we had to wait for a van with a working lift and one time the lift broke while my travel mate was half way up the lift.

I was told by the front desk before I arrived to check in before 3AM or lose my reservation. I arrived approximately 130AM. When I arrived I was told that my room was already given away and I was misinformed. I was told there was ABSOLUTELY no rooms left anywhere in any of the buildings or towers. I drove over an hour very tired from work and not yet showered. I was understandably upset and too tired to drive backhome. I waited at the front desk for a solution. While I waited I watched a black couple and Asian family turned away for the same reason. Then a white man approached the seven stars counter and received a key. I questioned the staff about him receiving a key. They claimed he had a hostess that held the room for him so it does not show up in the system and only seven stars members can receive this service. The next thing that happened is what took this to another level. A young white couple walked up maybe 15 minutes later and received a key and they were Gold members like myself. When I once again questioned why the staff member passing the couple the key said he had no idea by shrugging his shoulders. Are you serious. He was following his managers orders but had no idea why this was the given order. I had a reserved room just like the white couple. I wondered why they kept offering me a seat away from the counter. I am glad I kept my place at the front counter to see this happen. The other 2 families from earlier left but I stayed. Now a 3rd white family approached and staff gave them the speech about no room. The staff had no choice because we caught them in the act. The white folks complained a slight bit and surprise the staff says they have 3 rooms available that just need cleaning and they will get them two rooms and myself a room.

The dresser drawer would not stay closed. I would close it and it would slide open. After walking into it twice we had to drape it off. Also there was a metal rod sticking out of the bottom of the bed frame which could have ultimately ripped into ones leg. The air conditioner was not working so I called maintenance. A very nice gentleman came up and said the unit does not work like your and changed the filter which was extremely clogged. However when I tried to adjust the thermostat and moved the curtain over I could not believe how loaded the windowsill was with dead insects. There was also no mat in the tub and the no slip coating was worn off. Both my husband and I got lucky that we did not fall. It is no doubt an accident waiting to happen. Our room number was 832.

So here is what happened and why I am never going back to Harahs ACThe morning of my trip I received an email from Harahs saying that I can check in now on my phone and later on just finish up at the check in kiosk inside the hotel lobby. Did that all ready to go and took the two hour trip to start my mini vacation. I arrived at the hotel at noon checked my bag knowing that I will be back in two hours to check in and take my luggage up to the room. Around two pm I go to the check in kiosk and it said that my room is not yet available. Ok fine I will come back in a little while. Now from noon til about 3 pm I am walking around playing some slots and some blackjack. Trying to fill the hours until I can go up to my room. From 2 pm until 6 pm the hotel lobby is absolutely packed with guests trying to get into their rooms. In all honesty there had to be at least 40 50 guests in line trying to check in. I did not want to wait online in back of all of those guests. Was frustrated enough as it was. I am not sure if the front desk was shorthanded or if the staff was not ready to handle the large amount of guests. There was a line for each one of the check in kiosks also. When I did return to the check in kiosks after having waited online I was still unable to check in to my room. The kiosks ask for your reservation number and a valid i d either drivers license or passport. I typed in the reservation number but the kiosk was unable to read either of my passport or drivers license. Now it is 6 pm. I have already blown through a good amount of my gambling money after waiting 6 hours to get into my room and I am still not checked in yet. And oh yeah there is still about 40 50 guests waiting to check in also. So I had given up. Grabbed my suitcase from the bell hop and headed to my car to leave Harahs AC forever. And of course as I am leaving the parking garage I had to pay the 10 parking fee. I can say that the 10 was the last time Harahs AC will ever get my money. I should have stayed at Caesars Palace or Balys never had a problem there before. So now my trip to AC is ruined. Back home tonight after having left just this morning with high expectations.
