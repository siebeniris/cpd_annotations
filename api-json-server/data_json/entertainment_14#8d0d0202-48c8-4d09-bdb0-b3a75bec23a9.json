The park is huge we loved it kids loved it the most spending the whole day in the park with lots of activities. Some activities are very expensive and i believe they are not worth it at this rate photos with the dolphins or sea lions for example 10mins photo session for each person is 170 so for a family of four you are looking to pay 680 for 10mins. Some photo sessions goes up to 320 per person for 30mins. Food is expensive because that is what s available to you from the hotel anyways. drinking water is free in the room use that. there is no supermarket in the palm so u either buy from the resturants available to you or take a trip to the nearest supermarket to pickup grocery and food for the whole day. A taxi to Mall of the Emirates would cost around 15 for a one way trip. Always go with the government taxi beige blue or beige orange because they run a meter and will charge u based on that and its always the cheapest option. Otherwise you pick from limo to luxury cars but its always expensive. All in all great experience.

The hotel is as magnificent as all the reviews say However i thought i would highlight some tips for potential guests1. Check your bill every day. We had extra meals internet and spa treatments added daily. Staff are happy to remove them but i visited the front desk daily2. do not arrive at peak time. We arrived at 630am and had a lovely experience. However during the day the reception was packed like a train station at rush hour3. Make sure you get a package which includes all restaurants for meals especially breakfast. Some people were restricted to a single restaurant which had large queues. Staff were feeding people as they lined up. We were lucky enough to be able to change venue and go to a different place for breakfast under our package. Food outside packages is expensive4. Check you package entitlements when you arrive. Hotel did not honor some of the package benefits Kids Club. They also did not tell us about a free daily cocktail until the 3rd day when the barman checked our package5. Hotel is a long way from anywhere. We simply paid for private car transfers which are available outside the hotel. Factor this into your budget. Or catch the fee bus to the malls then taxi from there. Will save you money. 6. Go to the mall when you arrive and get a data sim card for 100 Dirham which lasted us the whole trip. You need you passport phone or ipad and a credit card. Internet at the hotel is 100 Dirham a dayAl in all it was a lovely 6 days.

Went to dubai for 6 nights with 3 older kids 18 16 11. We stayed at the marina for the first 3 nights whilst exploring Dubai and then Atlantis for the last 3 nights for some pampering me time. Atlantis was no doubt a beautiful hotel grand in all cases as one would expect. We had a lovely inter connecting room sea facing view on the 10th floor. I am glad we stayed but I doubt I will stay again and here is why. I feel the Atlantis are better suited for younger families. There are hundreds of young families around especially in the lobby either just admiring the aquariums or participating at one of the kids entertainment that is on. I have never sees the public areas of the hotel quiet whatever time of day. It is always buzzing and if you like that perfect. There are security guards manning some doorways that are not accessible by the non hotel residents and one must constantly carry with them room cards to get access. In our 4 day stay not once did we get to know any of the doormen security individuals nor did they get to know us. My point is it became very impersonal. I missed the quality of service we received at the marina hotel. after all that is one main reason why we choose to stay at certain hotelsWe stayed half board and on our first dinner we checked in quite late therefore we decided to eat at Kaleidoscope buffet restaurant. The food was good enough lots of variety but the service was awful. There were no friendliness from the waiters waitress mainly due to the busy evening they were having. We ordered a bottle of water for the table and that was the last time we had any interaction with any of the waiters waitress. We never came back. Jeferey our housekeeping was most pleasant and friendly and service by the pool Benson especially was top notch. To sum up I have no regrets in staying but next time I will choose one of the more smaller hotels in the area. The number of people staying and visiting the hotel is far too much for the staff to maintain a certain level of service one expects when staying at a hotel in this calibre.", "offset": [494, 658], "date": "2016-04-10 00:00:00", "cpt": "0", "category": "entertainment"}, {"id": 3, "uid": "6fc23b45-f007-4640-9118-4769822ef8d5", "sentence": "5 star.

We had excess to the exclusive lounges as an alternative but the selection there is rather poor and during happy hours far too few tables so many times not being desperate enough we just gave up. Sadly it is included in the price which in Dubai is generally very high. Not a real tourist paradise for Europeans. You can not find the real value for money feeling as you might do in Asia.

We took a taxi to the Burj Khalifa which was a great experience. The Dubai Mall is also worth a visit at the same time as this is where you enter The Burj. We were half board so the main expense for us were drinks which are steep but we expected that. Plenty of fresh water is left in your room for free which is a godsend.

A special mention goes to the gentleman who looked after our room every day Manoj who always did a great job with the room and was unfailingly cheerful and polite whenever we met him in the corridor leading to our room. The hotel while pretty heavily occupied never felt overcrowded which I have sometimes found at big hotels. You really get a sense of how many guests are staying at the hotel at dinner in the Kaleidoscope restaurant kind of the hotels main restaurant which is huge and very busy and is currently temporarily located in the ballroom. Despite the number of guests eating there at dinner time we never found ourselves in endless lines for food as there were so many options on offer that catered to a variety of tastes and this spread everybody around a bit. Be advised that you will find yourself waiting in line at some mealtimes at Kaleidoscope when you arrive to check in for your meal but the staff does a great job keeping it all moving. There are many other dining options at the hotel and we did not manage to try them all but you will definitely be spoilt for choice. The hotels famous attractions such as the Aquaventure water park and the Lost Kingdom aquarium should not be missed and the Dolphin Bay experience needs a review of its own.

We chose a room facing the sea as we felt it would be quieter. We were n\u2019t disappointed the room was lovely. Plenty of bottled water and if you want anymore leave a note for housekeeping We were on platinum half board. Most days ate in the club lounge as it was quieter. We went to saffron once for breakfast and it was amazing however very busy. The club lounge was more relaxing and we felt had plenty of choice. We also enjoyed sitting outside for breakfast. Afternoon tea in the club lounge was great and meant we did n\u2019t need to buy lunch on the days we were at the hotel. The canap\u00e9s and drinks in the evening were good and the staff were round regularly topping up glasses of wine and advising when the food and drinks service was stopping to give ample time to get what you wanted before close. You can stay in the lounge after the drinks and food finished. Hot and and cold canap\u00e9s available and there was even a chocolate desert one night. It was nice to have a couple of drinks before our meal. Cocktails were available as well as wine spirits beer and sparkling wine. The lounge was always clean and tables quickly cleared. We did n\u2019t eat in the restaurants after our afternoon tea as we were fairly full but the canap\u00e9s at the lounge offered enough of a snack to tide us over until breakfast. The lounge is open all day for soft drinks tea coffee and a few snacks. We ate at Saffron our first night and the choice was out of this world. As we arrived late it was fairly quiet and we were there until they closed after 1pm. We ate at Ayamna and that was fantastic. We also ate at Hakasan which was good but we preferred Ayamna the Lebanese restaurant. There was also a belly dancer which was entertaining. Our last night we ate at White Beach which was also good and included in the half board package. Points to note. Some restaurants require a supplement. The platinum package which offers house wine beer and soft drinks is n\u2019t available in all restaurants so check before you order book. It was n\u2019t available at White Beach and a Peroni beer was around \u00a3 10. The wine on the package was good red. Several choices of beer. Various soft drinks and water. The package is only available with the evening meal you do not get drinks at any other time. We did n\u2019t visit the water park. Plenty of sun beds around the pools lots of lifeguards around. Pools were warm and clean. Plenty of towels available by the pools. Bar service. The aquarium is amazing and there are plenty of shops to browse. It is very busy as people come to see the aquarium and use the water park and can wander round the public areas of the ground floor. You are given a lanyard you can wear with your room key to identify you in the hotel. You need this to access the lounge the lifts and the beach and pool areas as these are for hotel guests only. As it \u2019s such a huge hotel the security are unlikely to remember you so wearing it whilst you are walking to and from the pools etc means you do n\u2019t have to search round for it when you are asked. We did find a couple of the security staff remembered us as on occasion I was n\u2019t wearing the lanyard. It is however easier to put it on when accessing lifts pools etc we found. We found the staff helpful we had an issue with our room late one night as the electronic lock had failed and we could n\u2019t get in our room however it was swiftly replaced. We also went to Burj Al Arab for afternoon tea. Whilst this is in no way cheap it was a fantastic experience and one I highly recommend. We were offered a taxi back from outside the Burj these are the limo style taxis see comment below about getting a taxi however to get the metered taxi you have to walk over the causeway and queue so we took the offered limo and paid the extra. It \u2019s a shortish ride to the Atlantis from the Burj so was n\u2019t too expensive. If you are on bed and breakfast there are numerous restaurants cafes at the marina which is only a short taxi ride and plenty of taxis outside the Atlantis. Prices at the Mall vary but you can get reasonably priced meals. There were also some really nice restaurants but we did n\u2019t eat out as we were on half board. Atlantis is at the end of the palm so there are no shops cafes restaurants to walk to so they do have the monopoly which is reflected in the price. Taxis are however cheap and plentiful. Be aware however to get one of the metered yellow cabs we made the mistake of jumping into a limo type car at the Marina Mall as were we approached as we were leaving and asked if we wanted a taxi and did n\u2019t realise there were different types. We were told the cost as we got into the taxi but decided to go with it at that point. We did get free water and there were screens on the back of the seats in front for us to use but boy did we pay for the privilege It cost 3 times the price of a normal taxiWe had coffee and cake at the Dubai Mall. for no more than you would pay in a city in the UK. The water fountains are amazing but it gets very crowded at certain times and security at the Mall herd people to various exits to watch go with the flow.
