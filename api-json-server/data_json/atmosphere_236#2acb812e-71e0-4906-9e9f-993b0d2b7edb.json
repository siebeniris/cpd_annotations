The General Manager should be commended on his hiring of terrific staff that makes the hotel what it is known for. There is a valet that has been there for over 20 years and he is the face of Buckhead he is the first one who will greet you and the last one who will say farewell to you on your way home.

I had the chance to reserve a Club Level Executive Suite for my 35th Birthday Celebration and had an amazing time at the Ritz Carlton Buckhead. Even before our stay Kyle from Guest Services contacted me to get all the necessary details regarding my stay to make it extra special. The hotel is in great shape with elegant furniture and modern elevators but what makes this location so special are their ladies and gentleman. The service that they provide as you come into the hotel is impeccable and certainly know how to appreciate loyal Ritz Carlton Elite members. We were in the 19th Floor and would highly recommend the Club Level experience. Located on the 18th floor the lounge has five different food presentations throughout the day and is incredible. Caroline and Elena at the Club Lounge treated us like kings and felt really at home. Also there are special events on Friday evenings from 060 PM 070 PM where there are special food presentations or the spa comes into the lounge to give 10 minute massages to its guests. I have to thank Jaret from the Spa that actually was more than accommodating in staying a little bit longer for both of us to get a massage and it was amazing. The Pool and Jacuzi on the third floor were great and there is a small patio to sunbathe. Finally the afternoon tea experience at the Gallery restaurant was worth every penny and felt truly special during my birthday celebration with a variety of sandwiches desserts and champagne to compliment the entire experience. This is one of the best Ritz Carlton hotels that we have stayed in during the last three years and certainly recommend it.
