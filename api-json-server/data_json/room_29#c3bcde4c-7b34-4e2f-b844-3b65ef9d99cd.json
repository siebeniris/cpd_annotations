The hotel was one of many suggested as a package break and I chose it purely due to the existing feedback from guests. Very very happy they turned out to be true. The hotel is beautiful overlooking the joining of 5 canals. The rooms are very stylish if not a little too business like although as a business hotel I guess this means they are doing well. Our room was facing inwards towards the car park we had heard this was a very distant second compared to the canal facing rooms but we really were not bothered from the 4th floor with views over to the city lights it was still picturesque. If you can however I imagine nighttime views over the canals would be incredible. The restaurant and bar is fantastic the food is limited but all top quality. The staff in particular both in the bar and the reception were beautifully accommodating and helpful. It is about a 20 minute walk into the true center of Amsterdam do not let this put you off as I am one for convenience but even I did not mind the stroll along the canals to find some incredible places for breakfast lunch and dinner. Breakfast at 22 euros seemed a little steep a 10 minute walk to the nearby Cafe Binen Buiten means a full European breakfast coffee and orange juice in a beautiful little Dutch cafe at half the price. Free wifi was great although slow in the evening. Highly recommended.", "offset": [273, 332], "date": "2015-02-02", "cpt": "0", "category": "room"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "c87b1646-de16-4ddd-9b6f-7fbb356e1b3e", "sentence": "Out of city centre but strangely this is a plus. I will be honest this location seemed too far from the city centre as it is beyond the canal rings. I was not sure what to expect and I was pleasantly surprised. The Wyndham Apollo is located in a tranquil area right on a picture perfect Dutch canal. What I would remember most about this hotel is the smiles. Such a friendly staff. And not to forget. that bed. It was so comfy dreamy I forgot to ask what mattress they use. I did not want to leave my bed. The room was nice and clean. The workout room not gym was perhaps a little disappointing because it was quite small. So skip the gym and rent a bike from the hotel. I did just that and I pedalled all over Amsterdam like a local. It was WONDERFUL. I came to know Amsterdam in a way that I was not expecting. The fact is that nothing is really far away. For example the hotel would be about a 40 min walk to Anne Franks House on Prinsengracht. By bike that is about 15 20 mins. Rijksmuseum or the Van Gogh Museum are probably a 20 min walk from hotel but less than 10 mins by bike. I had say the hotel is in a better location for museums than if you were staying in the city centre. The Wyndham Apollo is right near the Art Zuid Sculpture Garden on Apololan. A must if you are into sculptures and even if you are into strolling along a nice park near canal. As for restaurants and bars there is plenty within walking distance. The front desk is happy to help out. I had recommend having breakfast at De Bakerswinkel Amsterdam South that was a nice find. The hotel restaurant is also very good and offers nice portions. I was impressed with my stay at the Wyndham Apollo.

We looked at this Hotel on a booking site at the early part of this year and made a provisional booking. Later the hotel was selected as a preferred hotel by our association so conference in Amsterdam. We reboked directly with the Hotel a canal suite and the reception at that time were extremely helpful. When we arrived at the Airport for the shuttle in did not turn up and another driver from the hotel group called our driver. When he finally came to collect us he then had to fill up with diesel The room is comfortable with a superb view over the canals junction Sadly the amenities in the room did not match and we had th ask for shower gels soap ad tissues. Frankly the suite needs prefurbishment. The services for breakfast are very poor and the staff unhelpful. On one day our room had not been cleaned until gone 160 and we had to ask twice with the Duty manager and then spoke with him about our total disappointment with his hotel He sent a bottle of wine and some beers to our room and a note of apology a nice gesture but little compensation. and we did not drink them and left them behind.

We stayed at the Wyndham Apollo before beginning a Viking river cruise in late April 2016. Our room was on the ground floor and we were surprised at how quiet the room was. It is a very comfortable hotel but we found the hotel restaurant to be expensive. We arrived on Kings Day and with all of the celebrations decided to stay in house for lunch it was also raining. We enjoyed the view of the canal and the party boats on the canal but the music was too loud to really relax and enjoy our very over priced lunch. We asked the waiter if he could turn down the music and he said no that it was only like this one day a year. the celebration of Kings Day. and we would just have to tolerate it. Very unpleasant.

We stayed here for 3 nights mid August and could not fault a thing. The hotel staff are pleasant and welcoming and our room was spot on clean spacious and quiet. After reading various reviews on the Wyndham Apollo I was ready for a mammoth walk into the centre of Amsterdam each day but it took just 30 40 mins to walk to the red light district. Other attractions such as the Heineken Experience Rijksmuseum and Van Gogh museum were about 15 mins walk away. We did not use any public transport but for those who can not or do not like to walk far buses and trams run through regularly. We did not eat in the hotel there is plenty of pavement cafes close by where we went for breakfast.

We asked before arrival for a room with a bath tub as it shows you in the pictures of the room on their website we received a room with no bath tub. The room was cold the heater in the room blew out cold air only even when turned up to the max setting of 30. The radiator in the room was located in front of the full length window and the curtains closed in front of the radiator meaning we had no heat at all in the room with the curtains closed. I understand it was cold outside but it was uncomfortably cold in the room at any point of the day or night. The walls were paper thin it felt like we came to this hotel for a relaxing break away as my partner was 25 weeks pregnant when we arrived for our stay. We were awoken throughout the night by a screaming baby on two nights of our stay in another room woken from people running down the hallway during the night and on our last morning the hotel had a cherry picker parked outside our window with its engine running from 825 am making it impossible to get back to sleep after an already disturbed nights sleep no different to our three previous nights stay. for a four star hotel i feel it lacked a level of class and professionalism people usually go on holiday to relax from their already busy and stressful lives we were unfortunately unable to do this whilst staying at the Wyndham Apollo Hotel Amsterdam. I have stayed in 6 hotels in Amsterdam since 2010 and this was my worst experience here yet i would never stay here again.
