This time I stayed in an Executive Club Suite and was pleasantly surprised by how spacious and well appointed the room was. We had a view over Hyde Park with glimpses of the Harbour and were granted access to the Club Lounge located on the top floor. The lounge offers refreshments throughout the day with a special afternoon tea served on weekends along with complimentary drinks and canapes served before dinner. The selection is fair but could be more extensive along with the breakfast which features limited hot items. The staff were all accommodating and friendly and constantly checked if we required assistance or drinks. The lounge features televisions business facilities conference rooms and a selection or reading materials which can be enjoyed on one of the lounges inside or on one of the balconies outside with views over Hyde Park and the city. The hotel exudes an overall feeling of luxury and comfort and each time I have stayed at the Sheraton I have only been greeted by friendly and helpful staff. My only request would be to have more power points in the bathroom as one is not enough and to broaden the breakfast menu for the Club lounge as I expected more considering the cost. Otherwise the hotel is beautifully finished and in a great location near museums Westfield Sydney and QVB for shopping and only a short walk down to Darling Harbour to enjoy a lovely Sydney evening. Thank you Sheraton for a lovely stay and I look forward to returning in the future.", "offset": [1135, 1317], "date": "2015-02-23", "cpt": "0", "category": "restaurant"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "933d98cf-7076-46e2-975d-d28558e20465", "sentence": "Super convenient.

We checked into your hotel yesterday. I would like to put on the record our dining experience. It started by being told we could not have a table at the early sessions this weekend. We are staying in this hotel because of previous positive dining experiences over the years and intended to have most of our meals in the hotel. Maybe we should have been advised that we should book in advance if we wished to dine when we booked the room. We booked and arrived for the second sitting at 805 to find a throng of 100 hungry diners queued in a melee that would make you think a Sizlers queue a pleasure to line up in. We went back to our room for half an hour had a drink and tried again. This time no one was there not even someone to show us to our reservation. The food and service was some of the worst I have experienced in years I \u2019l just itemise1The shellfish had been well picked over by the time we got there. Half the oyster and clam shells were empty. The oysters although sweet and fresh were the smallest I have ever been served I presume guests had been picking them off the shell to double up2The bugs were tasteless probably due to being frozen to long3SERIOUSLY the blue swimmer crab was off. One whiff walking past them told the story I would be surprised if no one eating them did n\u2019t end up in the loo for the night4On the main buffet half a whole salmon was all that was left for protein. Oyster Kilpatrick never surfaced. The pork cold leftover and half an hour later the meat titled \u2018 lamb shanks \u2019 which they were not arrived over cooked dry and swimming in a black onion soup of some sort yuck5Why there was a three person deep throng at the dessert table is beyond comprehension. The deserts were so bad that the woman next to me left with jelly beans and Jaffas in a bowl comlaining about the quality of the jelly beans. I just had ice cream only one to choose from the waiter said he \u2019d be back in 5 minutes with the other6We ate our desert and had to ask for the table to be cleared this was half done and reluctantly we put the waste seafood scrap bowl on the floor so we could eat desert without the whiff of prawnheads7Tea and coffee was not offered as has been usual in the past. So my wife ordered tea by the time the milk arrived had to ask. the tea was cold and my coffee still had not arrived. I finally had enough and complained to a young woman who said she was the manager. I had n\u2019t seen her all night she was talking at the register rather than running her restaurant. She said she would definitely get back to me and pass on my complaints to the staff I \u2019m sure she \u2019l blame the staff but I did n\u2019t believe she would get back to me because she scrawled my name and room number on the back of a soiled drink coaster. The worst. guests at tables around me were complaining as well. Needless to say I \u2019m canceling my other restaurant reservations and do n\u2019t expect to be billed for this meal. And further if you expect payment without argument for minibar items may I suggest you supply a minibar menu with prices. Further I asked for my room to be made up at 10 am. When I returned at 3 pm it was still unmade and I waited in the bar till almost 4 pm. bloody disgraceful.", "offset": [3133, 3218], "date": "2015-09-27", "cpt": "0", "category": "restaurant"}, {"id": 3, "uid": "ac194533-202f-457c-9195-088a9ddab856", "sentence": "Enjoyable Great location very clean quite and comfortable great staff.

This was good as the restaurant at the Sheraton was most disappointing. Not wanting to spend 85 each on a seafood buffet we chose the a la carte menu at the restaurant one evening. What a disappointment this was. The choice for healthy eating vegetarian options was so limited that it seemed like a menu of 10 20 years ago. We ordered soup which was very tasty but was priced at over 20 and came in such a large bowl that we could not finish it. Price and serving both need to be lowered to make it an acceptable entree dish. Also we ordered crunchy cajun sweet potatoes expecting to taste the cajun spice. A plate of deep fried oily sweet potato chips were presented to us. They had so much batter that we could not eat them and there was not an ounce of cajun either on or in these chips despite the restaurant manager stating that the chips were rolled in cajun spice before being deep fried. This certainly did not occur with our batch. The menu should have stated that these chips were deep fried also. Crunchy does not necessarily mean deep fried. Surely the Sheraton can do better than this in it is nicely appointed restaurant. While we thoroughly enjoyed the location close to shops and Hyde Park and the very comfortable and attractive room I was unhappy with the food choices.

Sheraton on the Park needs to understand that not everyone who stays there has a business account to put their food on. There should be a range of prices. This was not so.

I stayed at Sheraton on the Park for the first time ever despite being an Aussie native for over 20 years. I must add that the overall the service is impeccable. My interactions with Heath at check in were enough to convince me that my stay was going to an awesome one. Heath took his time welcoming me to the hotel and was very patient polite and professional and even went as far as recommending me a room on the top floors. The room on said floor itself was like a mini palace. I was blown away by the opulence and space it provided. Sheraton is bang in the CBD and I recommend tourists get off at St James Train Station. The cheapest way to get to the hotel is by the trains bar none. It helps to buy an Opal Card from the domestic Airport Train Station. For International visitors getting the opal card is a must it is the most convenient and cheapest way to see Sydney on trains ferries buses as this is Australia \u2019s largest city. My thanks to Fraser for coming to check out the issue I had with the TV in the room. He was most pleasant to deal with. Opposite the hotel is the family oriented HYDE PARK one would find it a total surprise to find a tranquil family park amid the CBD craziness.

As for eating options Sydney boasts amazing cuisine options form Fast Food all the way to fine dining not mention the myriad of cuisines available in the city is endless. I would also like to thank the polite Asian lady her name I believe is Cho \u2013 she helped me with a few concerns as well. On checkout I was greeted by Indian gentleman Mr Bedi who treated me with respect and dignity. I was most pleased with my stay overall and look forward to returning one day soon. Definitely I would say SOTP is in my list of TOP 10 hotels for Sydney a magnificent yet opulent city that offers much to see and do \u2013 the possibilities are on and almost endless.

What I did not like in retrospect it was a mistake to pay extra for a park view room. Although most traffic noise is blocked out there were intrusive noises from buses and regular siren sounds from emergency vehicles coming into the room well into the night On Monday morning house keeping started their work with the vacuum cleaner at full blast at 730AM on my floor. After this went on for half an hour I stuck my head outside the door to see what the commotion was but it looks like just regular house keeping which seems to be starting unreasonably early and continued for more than an hour.

It was very hard to get more then 5 glass refills in 2 hours due to staff being busy or focused on other tasks some times it felt like staff was sparce The staff very kindly talked about everything we had on our high tea stand.
