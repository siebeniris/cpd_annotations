Martha Washington looks good on paper and the rooms even look good until you try to sleep there. I booked my 5 nights there at least 5 months in advance and was given the dud room. Oh yes they know it is the dud room but will not let you in on the secret. The room is fine if you like sleeping in a sauna. If not you have to turn on the freight train noisy air conditioner that blows freezing cold air at you. Then chugs to a stop where the room heats to sauna again and the air con kicks in to freeze you. We had to leave the air con off to get any sleep. Oh and then there was being awoken at 6 am by the ceiling rattling. I thought it was the air con dying it is last breath but it was not on. This kept up to the point I rang reception in alarm thinking something horrible was happening. Oh no we were located under the gym. Reception said we will move you but the question being why they do not put the 1 night stays in the dud room and give the longer stays a non dud room.

Note. I visited when this was the Martha Washington but the refurbishment was almost complete. I prefer this location to the upper east or upper west as it is more central. I preferred the stay here to the W on Lexington. I did not actually have time to visit the gym but it is supposed to be quite large which I expect is rarity for a hotel in New York. The rooms were a very high standard and a great size if you avoid the smallest I stayed 3 times in total and once in a small room. I did have an issue with dry cleaning however the customer relations lady sorted it out quickly and efficiently and was generally very good.

One issue with our room ruined our stay in New York. The air conditioning unit in the rooms is EXTREMELY loud. It does not run constantly and every 8 12 minutes clicks on then stays on for a period of time. When it is on it sounds like a jet engine over your head. I think some rooms are better than others because when we first arrived we asked for a new room due to this sound. We thought it was someone running on a treadmill overhead. it was not it was the AC unit. Due to this my business partner and I were only able to sleep several interrupted hours. This made for a long day of work the next day. Aside from the AC units the rooms are clean and functional. Beds were comfortable and the mini bar and snack area were well stocked. Hotel staff could not have been kinder and more helpful during our stay. Modern chic decor. Friendly and helpful front desk staff. Wonderful location. Walking distance to tourist activities.

Second I arrived early by train at 1 pm and was told that there were no rooms ready but they would call me when ready did not get the call 50 charge for early check in if available. At check out I was told I was a no show. Also a nasty extra charge I said no that is not true I slept there. Then she gives me the bill with the extra charge. So I show her my confirmation showing the total 28 less. I also pull up the screen shot of the website total. She says to me I am not going to debate it with you I just have to show my manager No sorry let me talk to my manager. Clearly this happens often good thing I had a printed confirmation.

Quite often there is only one person on reception so there is often a que which can be annoying if you only want to ask something. We had to ask for a visitors guide which were not on display. Maybe a good idea to have them on display for guests to help themselves. There is no tea or coffee in the rooms but free hot drinks on ground floor in the mornings.

This was APARANTLY for the extras and service we got which we knew nothing about it was n\u2019t until day 3 we found out we should of been getting two bottles of water a day a free coffee each morning.

This was my second stay at The Redbury Hotel NYC. The hotel is in a great location and has very close and easy access to the green and yellow subway lines. There is also a Barys Botcamp Gym two blocks south witch is a big plus for me. The best thing about this stay was Shelley who covers the reception night shift. During my first night all night long there was construction across the road from the hotel and the noise combined with jet lag was terrible. At 4 am I finally could not take anymore and went down to reception to see if I could change to a room away from the noise. Without hesitation and with an amazing attitude and professionalism Shely quickly changed me to a new room on the opposite side of the hotel.

We where treated with beautiful amenities in the room for not one but two days to make it memorable.

Not to mention you are within walking distance to wonderful attractions Empire State Building Times Square 5th ave etc beautiful restaurants and shops. The hotel also has access to New York club gyms which beat any hotel gym any day. Much better than my stay the night before in every way. Marta is also a great restaurant and they have a great bar.
