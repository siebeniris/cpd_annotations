Rosewood Little Dix Bay is a gem of a property located along a spectacular beach on Virgin Gorda. Built over 50 years ago by Lawrence Rockefeller the resort was designed so that cottages were not visible approaching the shore by water or from town on land. Little Dix boasts perhaps the most amazing staff one could hope to meet locals who are incredibly warm and friendly loyal to the resort and what it stands for and have been with Little Dix for years. They know the names of guests hug the many children who have returned year after year watch the kids grow up love to share stories of their families and just could not be more delightful in every way. There are different levels of accommodation but all are spacious and simply but tastefully furnished. My personal favorites are the hexagonal beachfront villas but there are tree houses for families houses for those who want them and other offerings. Since the resort makes golf carts readily available it is easy to get around even if you are a bit far from the Pavilion dining. There are two main restaurants on the resort The Pavilion and the Sugar Mill their gourmet restaurant for guests over 12 years. The Pavilion offers buffet breakfasts a la carte lunches and dinners that alternate between buffet and a la carte meals. In previous years the resort offered themed buffets Asian night or Italian night as well as a kids buffet and hopefully they will return to that idea. This year food was definitely better as there is a new chef. There is usually music during dinner a blend of reggae ballads and other music. The beach itself is a gorgeous strip of golden sand bordered by mangrove trees that stretches the length of the bay. Along the mangrove edge are a series of thatched umbrellas for shade and beach chairs that are nicely spaced so that you are not on top of anyone and each set of visitors has their own personal space. Waters are warm and when snorkeling the bay you can see a fair amount of fish life including the resident ray and turtle. Staff walk the shore taking orders for lunch or drinks so beach picnics are easy. The resort offers free masks and fins as well as kayaks sailboats and paddle boards for guests. In addition there are bubble classes for kids sailing lessons drops to other beaches tubing and assorted excursions to surrounding islands. Located at the resort is Dive BVI the best of the dive companies in the area. Most of the staff has been with the organization for many years knows the area and its currents well and is extremely safety conscious. They have excellent equipment for rent. Dive BVI also offers charter dive excursions as well as scuba classes and the people could not be nicer. In addition to beach and water sports adults can play tennis work out in the well equipped gym zone out in the spa and even play croquet. There are also a few hiking trails on the property to nearby beaches or over the hill to the harbor. In the Rosebud Center for children kids can do arts and crafts play house or dress up listen to music or even have their hair braided island style. The resort also offers everything from cookie decorating to pizza making to face painting as well as a resident magician. So there is more to do than just soak up the sun. If there is an issue with the resort it is the new management with its ability to organize and supervise staff and relate particularly to long time guests. Management has not put effective systems in place to handle dining service in an efficient timely manner make sure that water or bread are delivered to tables handle the increase in a la carte service or handle meal service on the beach. Developing these systems is something critically needed particularly when there is a staff that is so warm and willing to help. Management has to also learn to relate to their guests in a more meaningful way. This is not a big resort and strives for a very intimate atmosphere. Many of the people have returned over and over again have developed friendships with other guests and are great cheerleaders for Little Dix. It would really help to find a minute to talk to these people and get their thoughts something different from a casual How is dinner. question while people are eating. In essence though Rosewood Little Dix Bay is a gem that needs to be constantly polished and treasured. There are few places like it.", "offset": [2244, 2383], "date": "2015-01-06 00:00:00", "cpt": "0", "category": "beach"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "115e89c0-db8b-4bc9-b010-fee1bed49398", "sentence": "Exceeded expectations. My husband and I just returned from 7 glorious days at Little Dix Bay. It was simply wonderful. From the minute we got on the ferry to the resort we were greeted by the kindest staff. That kindness from EVERYONE continued throughout our stay. We were impressed by the families that have been coming to Little Dix for years and how the staff was familiar with them. Within days the wait staff were calling us by name \u2026. so personal. Here are a few of the highlights of our trip. The beach is by far the most beautiful of any resort in the Caribbean. We saw turtles and plenty of fish \u2026 \u2026 from our kayak. Just imagine what you can see with a snorkel. The bay is quiet no jet skis which we really liked. Our room was immaculate we were in room 75 which is a hike to the restaurant but there were always shuttles available. and situated really close to the beach. We loved being on that end of the beach as it is quiet. It was so refreshing to have ample beach chairs as in some resorts you have to get up early to save chairs. There are plenty of floats to enjoy the beautiful water. Also there is a great hike beginning right behind our room which is the hike to Savannah Bay. It is the perfect balance of cardio and view. Once you get to Savannah Bay it will take your breath away. The cleanliness of the resort was most impressive. The housekeepers were very nice and our room was an oasis each day. The food was delicious. The breakfast buffet at the Pavilion was amazing. We enjoyed having dinner at the Sugar Mill each night as it is a smaller restaurant and less crowded. It is steps away from the beach a beautiful setting. The spa is gorgeous. Patricia gave me a massage and it was excellent. Go to the yoga platform and discover some chairs tucked in on the side of the hill to watch the sunset. We WILL be back to this special gem \u2026 \u2026 hopefuly very soon.", "offset": [939, 1046], "date": "2015-03-24 00:00:00", "cpt": "0", "category": "beach"}, {"id": 2, "uid": "18b42f45-da05-4dd3-b621-c657061202fe", "sentence": "Rosewood Little Dix Bay.

We traveled to Virgin Gorda not knowing anything about it other than everyone we knew who had been there loved it. So after figuring out how to get there a direct flight from DFW to San Juan and then a Cape Air puddle jumper to Virgin Gorda our trip was booked. Our first impression of Little Dix Bay was before we even arrived at Virgin Gorda our flight from San Juan to Virgin Gorda was canceled so were being rerouted to Tortola where we would then take a ferry to Virgin Gorda. I called Little Dix Bay to inform them of the itinerary changes and they were very accommodating arranging the transfer to the ferry as well as the ferry which delivered us directly to the resort. We were met with their signature rum punch which was amazing and then driven to our hill top villa. The villa was beautiful. Spacious with fabulous views out every window. The property was perfection. The daily breakfast buffet offered something for everyone and we had everyone in our group. from carnivores to vegans. The extensive beach was beautiful offering groupings of four lounge chairs an ocean chair and two pool floats per each umbrella. The beach waiters came by periodically offering refreshing frozen grapes ice water and Evian face spritzes. There were also numerous kayaks catamarans paddle boards etc. available to use as well. The snorkeling we amazing with the rich sea life in the bay.

The bay is beautiful expansive and immaculately serviced. Great for relaxing in the surf long swims the two swimming pontoons are 14 mile apart and the bay is much larger than that and good long snorkels. The opposite end of the bay to the restaurant is very shallow and the reef not in in good shape I was told rockerfeler dynamited it but there is anyway some caribbean reef die back in the area. so the best swimming end is near the shipping channel. There are a good number of interesting fish including some trumpet and cow fish further out though not so many parrot fish etc. The real stars of the piece are the resident sting rays the turtles there is good turtle grass in the bay and the 3 miniature black tip shark that constantly patrol the surf disney like accompanied by their little fish friends. The beautiful beach is great for a romantic stroll a relaxing read or building sandcastles. The water sports facilities are fun and entertaining and well used. We did kayaking paddle boarding and sailing. Note the bay is a little shallow at one side for the hobie cats so people tend to sail out further as the water is still pretty sheltered by other islands further out. Be warned that the boat guys will not rush to save you if you capsize in fact they likely wo nt notice for a very long time and if they do notice the only way to rescue you is with the little motor boat that could be out for a long time ferrying guests to other beaches so wear a life jacket if going out of the bay. The beach drops are a lot of fun and very varied. Mountain trunk is slightly hairy with an awful lot of life on the reef including literally thousands of the benign mountain jellyfish. whereas Valley Trunk is much more tame and extremely beautiful Virgin Gorda style with the giant boulders of the baths providing a back drop to the picture perfect coral sand. Did nt try the other activities as so entertained with the watersports but there looked like a good program of things. The creche was very well equipped with the worlds largest collection of crayons to draw turtles and fish with. The food was lovely and the service extremely friendly the breakfast chef alex was a particular high light. Only downside was there was not enough caribbean food on the menu for our liking. The atmosphere was relaxed low key and fun and the restaurants had beautiful views and the live music was great. The accommodation was great and everywhere extremely clean though the service was a bit hit and miss if anything broke. I asked for our broken coffee machine to be fixed everyday for four days and everyday they forgot and there were a few little niggles like that. But it did nt much matter I could make tea and there was plenty of coffee at breakfast. There was a mix up with our room booking and we got the wrong one and the hotel management went above and to fix their mistakes and it seemed they really did want to try the best to ensure we had a thoroughly enjoyable stay.", "offset": [27, 84], "date": "2015-08-28 00:00:00", "cpt": "0", "category": "beach"}, {"id": 5, "uid": "f851baee-95c7-43ea-bdb1-040ed6ba1581", "sentence": "Amazing Beach Vacation. I had heard so much about this property that I could not wait to go. Stayed on the Stay for 5 nights pay for 4 package and added the meal plan. Beautiful property inside a reef. Beautiful large room with spacious bathroom. Nice pool for a break from the beach. Fabulous snorkeling right off the beach. Saw many stingrays turtles a baby shark and a fish that was so cool I still laugh about it looking right at me while snorkeling. Took a hobie out of the reef and saw so many turtles. The food was excellent. Breakfast buffet was fabulous. Lunch and dinner selections were great. Not sure we would add the meal plan next time as my husband and I are not big eaters and would have been better off eating al la carte. Went off property to eat for only one night. While this property is difficult to get to it is well worth it. Try to fly in and out of Virgin Gorda as the ferries can be challenging for scheduling. One small glitch in an otherwise fabulous trip was a scorpion that had found its way into our room one evening. It was on the floor of our bathroom and when I called the desk to tell them about it they were so nonchalant. I do not know if this happens all the time on Virgin Gorda but not where I come from. I was a bit alarmed. They sent a man to take care of it and nothing was said in any way of an apology. We had stayed at Biras Creek a few years ago and Little Dix is so much more luxurious but Biras Creek had more watersports. All in all I can certainly recommend this property to anyone looking for a great beach vacation.", "offset": [285, 325], "date": "2015-08-29 00:00:00", "cpt": "0", "category": "beach"}, {"id": 6, "uid": "360484b2-9cca-401f-96ec-0f1628cfd323", "sentence": "Our Favorite Vacation. It was our 10th anniversary and we wanted to take a trip we could always look back on as perfect. We were open to anywhere in the world and nothing was off limits as long as we believed it was the absolute best choice for us. We wanted a tropical paradise with every amenity and a lot of privacy. We wanted to feel like we were on our own planet when we wanted. We wanted to be close to water sports and excursions if we wanted. We wanted excellent food. We wanted to never see a crowd or wait in a line or feel like we were in the middle of a Spring Break meat market. We wanted to sit on the beach have a few drinks read a few books and feel peaceful. We wanted to take day trips and dig into the local beauty. We wanted access to all of the things we might want to do but not be in the middle of it all. Little Dix Bay on Virgin Gorda was all of these things in its own superlative way. Most days we sat on the beach just a few steps outside our door with just a few people anywhere near us while they brought us incredible food and tasty cocktails. One day we rented a jeep arranged through the concierge. If you have a free day I would definitely recommend this. There are a lot of great beaches and restaurants to visit around the island. We also did a jet ski tour around the island which was incredible. Go to Blue Rush Water Sports and Jet Ski Rentals. These guys are great. The tour guide took us around Virgin Gorda and the private islands of Richard Branson Paul Allen Oprah etc. You can go as fast or slow as you want. The water in that area is pretty calm so if you are new to jet skis you will be just fine. There is so much to do on Virgin Gorda you could easily fill every hour of a week long vacation and still not see it all. Even if you just stay on the Little Dix Bay property you can find plenty of activities to keep you busy. Our trip to Little Dix Bay was absolutely perfect. It was everything we wanted and more.

An added bonus is that there is a boat on the island that will take you to nearby beaches to visit. do not miss Spring Bay.

I use reviews to glean information on properties. As such opinions are of limited usefulness. After all you do not know me my tastes or travel habits. Instead I will try and provide information that I wish I would have known before booking this resort. Not because it would have changed my opinion in fact we very much enjoyed our trip but because it would have been useful. Also there is little to say about the grounds dining and facilities since this resort is undergoing a major 18 month renovation. I suspect that when it reopens it will be the prime option in the Virgin Islands. Transfers Little Dix is hard to get to. Most will want to fly into Tortola but those airlines are notoriously unreliable and their small planes mean checked baggage may not travel with you. You can get their from St THomas but Virgin Gorda is about a 2 HR boat ride and that does not include going through customs in Tortola. Beach beautiful beach with soft white sand. It can be a little narrow in spots especially at high tide. It can also be busy in high season but its size makes it feel I crowded. There is a decent reef for snorkling but boats continually come in and out through the Bay there is no roped off swimming section. As such if snorkling you have to be careful tomwatch for incoming boat traffic. They will not watch for you. Fod it is Caribbean food. Serviceable but nothing special. However you are not coming here for food. The buffets on the other hand are impressive. Landscaping Little Dix is beautifully designed and landscaped. I am sure they will retain that character. Island features. The Baths if done in the late afternoon are an amazing thing of nature. well worth the short drive from Little Dix.

A couple of things that were upsetting I would like to discuss because it was a VERY expensive stay and long journey and it did not meet my expectations. I am very thorough with my planning and had sent an email prior to my arrival to ensure that I could see and do all the things we wanted to accomplish no one answered my email. I then called your 80 and requested that they transfer to me to speak directly with the resort which we did. I spoke to a woman who stated that she was overwhelmed w emails. Quite astonished as the resort was less than 30 full when we were there. Anyway I told her to look for my email so that I could ensure that we would make sure all the plans could be accomplished. She told me that I would not be able to travel to Anegada as the ferries are no longer running. I also inquired thru the butlers and front desk a few times while there at the resort and was told the same. When we left we met another couple at the VG BVI airport who said this is false that there are ferries every day. they pulled it up on a website and showed me. This is EXTREMELY disappointing as I now will have to come back to fulfill my wifes dreams of seeing this place. How is it possible that I can stay at some a high end resort and the staff be clueless or not even bother to look into it. They actually told me I could charter a boat for 140 or more which I felt was outrageous. So then I asked my butlers2. if they know of any other guests that may be traveling there or tortola and maybe we could join if there was room and help defer the costs and they told me they do not really communicate with the other butlers and basically made no attempt to help in this excursion request. There is no excuse for the many attempts that I made pre arrival and during that this could not have been discovered that we could have taking a ferry for a nominal fee to travel there. What is the purpose of having butlers if they do not help with something like this. When we arrived we met several people too many actually to be quite honest after traveling an entire day I really do not need to shake hands with 8 10 people prefer to just go to room and shower and maybe while eating there and waiting 45 mins for breakfast they could stop by the table and introduce themselves service is very slow. Also they provide free water in the room but charge 10 for the same bottle when we dine there. Really. They gave us an itinerary of daily events and emailed however every time I asked about it and said its on the itinerary they asked me to show them. like I am lieing or making it up. How is it that they do not know there are complimentary boat rides to the beach or give a map or description of some locations nothing. The same thing happened when I asked for the snorkel trip on the itinerary do you have it can you show me. Crazy. and none of those things ran as scheduled and took 45 mins to arrange. So in short I was less than impressed with the disorganization and lack of assistance to travel to ANegada and appalled they would not know this or even inquire. I would like another run at it but for 70 to stay there I am not really excited to return to potentially have the same experience. How can they be so unaware and at such minimum capacity and completely over staffed and not capable. Oh and lastly why do you have 5 7 men cutting the lawn at 8 am outside the beach rooms rather than doing it when no one is in there rooms. quite awkward and uncomfortable. sorry for the truth but you asked and I do not feel that my expense reflected my esperience.", "offset": [3392, 3530], "date": "2020-02-06 20:32:37", "cpt": "1", "category": "beach"}, {"id": 11, "uid": "fc1e3154-149c-446b-8454-42b8c808f5bd", "sentence": "5 Star Accommodations but only 1 star Service.

There was more space dedicated to a mini bar station than to closet space. The decor was extremely generic and could be found in any hotel anywhere. We miss the way the rooms were previously designed with an eye towards a west indian vibe. Also missing were any kind of outside footbaths or system for rinsing sandy feet. The previous version of the rooms had this and it seems to be a major oversight in a high end beach resort room.

Then when we did seek to use their services we had trouble finding them and getting any sort of timely response. However we kept being channeled through the butler whenever we wanted to book anything but we could find him and then we we did he never came back to confirm one way or the other whether he was able to arrange for what we had asked so we would have to track him down again for the follow up. In any event our butler experience was totally unacceptable.

Finally the design and decor of the room was disappointing. There was virtually no closet or drawer space which seems poor planning since many customers would stay for several nights or a week. There was more space dedicated to a mini bar station than to closet space. The decor was extremely generic and could be found in any hotel anywhere. We miss the way the rooms were previously designed with an eye towards a west indian vibe. Also missing were any kind of outside footbaths or system for rinsing sandy feet. The previous version of the rooms had this and it seems to be a major oversight in a high end beach resort room. The butler program which is intended to be a luxurious amenity was actually so poorly executed that it made our visit worse rather than better. The butlers did not give us an adequate introduction to the property room services etc. upon arrival and had we not been there before we would have been totally lost. Then when we did seek to use their services we had trouble finding them and getting any sort of timely response. However we kept being channeled through the butler whenever we wanted to book anything but we could find him and then we we did he never came back to confirm one way or the other whether he was able to arrange for what we had asked so we would have to track him down again for the follow up. In any event our butler experience was totally unacceptable. While not unavoidable it was also frustrating to have all the water out on the property one evening right before dinner so that we were not able to shower. In fact i was fully soaped up and shampooed in the shower when all the water stopped and i had to rinse off in the ocean.", "offset": [3460, 3581], "date": "2020-02-22 22:34:58", "cpt": "1", "category": "beach"}, {"id": 15, "uid": "ef603bd8-ae05-4388-bb75-eb82c7e4cf93", "sentence": "My wife and i have been going to the BVI for many years sailing throughout the islands but we had never staid in Little Dix Bay.

I sent an email upon our return home and inasmuch as I have not received a response I have decided to post here. The email began Please forward this to Mr Pade and Mr Arora in the event I have incorrect emails. Dear Mr Pade I am writing to make you aware of our experience at Rosewood Little Dix Bay. I chose to contact you directly rather than placing a review on Trip Advisor. We chose to visit Virgin Gorda not only for the beauty of the island but the exclusivity of Rosewood Little Dix Bay. The description on Google was \u201c high end beachfront lodging offering 3 restaurants an infinity pool plus a posh spa and a gym \u201d. According to your website there was a promise of \u201c dedicated butler service \u201d which was enticing as well. Although the hotel is quite beautiful the lack of service we experienced impacted our stay. We were spending 4 days with our very close friends the Bienstocks and were looking forward to relaxing and being pampered as we all have stressful lifestyles. In the interest of time I will list those items we found extremely disapointing1. There were 2 restaurants not 3. The farm to table restaurant is not ready. We ate at the Sugar Mill on Wednesday night our first night there. The service was beyond terrible. Anything we asked for from water to bread to cocktails never arrived until one of our friends got angry. At that point Marcus stepped in and tried to make everything right. He should be commended for his skills as well as his long hours and eforts2. We arranged with our butler to have housekeeping to arrive at 9. I realized the first day that I should change it to 12 noon so we would be out of the room and showered for the day ahead. Although I made the request the housekeeper came between 9 and 10 am. It was inconvenient to have them there when I was trying to shower after working out at the gym. We also realized that our butler is not \u201c dedicated \u201d to us. She has 14 other rooms to assist which it made it very difficult to get the attention we were expecting. 3. My husband and I wanted to purchase a bathing suit and a sweater from the shop. The women although very nice were unfamiliar with the process and it took at least 20 minutes before we could leave with our items4. The pools are tiny and the spas are not fully staffed. My husband wanted a massage either Thursday or Friday but there was no availability. 5. We ordered lunch on the beach. After an hour and a half we were informed that there was a problem in the kitchen. At that point the rain started and we went back to our room. Although we canceled the order we were charged anyway. There are attendants walking the beach but my husband had to move his own chaise and the towels were pretty much thrown on the edge of the chair instead of being properly set up. I would appreciate a response. Thank you in advance. I did not receive any response.", "offset": [2634, 2812], "date": "2020-02-28 00:00:00", "cpt": "1", "category": "beach"}, {"id": 17, "uid": "c0adf03c-b2da-40b1-9beb-3e61e97a0c2c", "sentence": "We had great expectations. Had never been to the BVI and obviously not the fabled LDBRosewod has done a great job with rebuilding after the storm. it is next to impossible to replace what a major hurricane destroys. The overall property looks great and the room was wonderful though there a couple of small things that could be tweaked to make the stay a bit better. The disappointing part. The staff overall was great hardworking well meaning and friendly. There were two notable exceptions. First the butler who was assigned to our room was simply missing in action. On the day of our arrival we were greeted by the butler. She escorted us to our room and asked about dinner. We said 7 pm at the Pavilion and she said she had make the reservation and come by about ten until 7 to walk us over. She never showed up so finally at ten after 7 we walked over to the Pavilion by ourselves. And there was no reservation. The next day she again asked about dinner reservations and we said 8 at the Reef House. We arrived at 8 and there was no reservation. They were able to fit us in so it was not a significant issue. And from that point on we started going directly to the front desk to make reservations and the only problem we had there was on our last night we requested dinner at 8 at the Reef House and when we showed up there was no reservation not the butlers fault. We had also asked the butler about arranging a car rental for Tuesday. We went to the front desk area at the time we agreed on 11 am and the butler was finishing up with someone while we waited. She then excused herself to check on the car and became clear after about a half an hour that she had dropped the ball again but was able to arrange for the car. On the afternoon of our last day we returned to the room after being at the beach and found a bucket of ice on the table. We had not ordered it. My wife ordered some room service and when it was delivered she asked the woman about the ice. She said that the butler was supposed to be providing it everyday. When my wife told her this was the first time we had received any ice the woman said something along the lines of somebodys been slacking. So our overall experience with the butler service was not great. The second disappointment was with the dining service. And we both basically agreed that the servers had simply not been trained properly. We do not know if that is because there was a rush to open the resort and there just was not time or if this is as good as it gets in the BVI. Hopefully the former. One quick example. The wine service was sloppy. The the server finished pouring a glass he she just pulled the glass away dribbling along the way. And because the tables are mostly wooden slats there were several occasions when the wine dripped through and onto our feet fortunately never hitting our clothes. As I said the staff seemed well meaning but they just did not seem to know what to do. I do want to add that our housekeeper was great and the young man Devon. who served us on the beach was also wonderful. And the spa was also a great experience. Beyond the staff issues the food service itself left us unimpressed. There were a few good dishes but by and large the food was just not what we expected. One example was the eggs Benedict. I had it three times and it was consistent. The muffin was so over toasted that it took a fair amount of pressure to cut through it. The bacon was paper thin. The egg whites were typically translucent not cooked enough. And the hollandaise not a sauce but more like a dollop of sour cream glopy. And this is just one example. So is this a training issue or is there just a skilled labor problem that is part of life in Virgin Gorda and throughout the BVIWe also felt like the menu offerings were a bit strange trying too hard to do something different but then falling short on execution. And the wine list particularly by the glass across all three restaurants was too limited. No opportunity for each restaurant to express itself. I assume the resort has a sommelier that could work with each location to create separate wine lists or at least have a couple of unique offerings per location. The beach food service could probably be expanded a bit more finger foods. And the distance from kitchen to the customer makes it difficult to deliver fresh and not food. I do not know how you solve that problem other that to add another kitchen facility further down the beach or cut back on the foods eg French Fries. that require hot delivery. Just before we left for the trip I read some of the reviews on TripAdvisor and I told my wife I do not want to be one of those people. I think private feedback like this is more appropriate and is hopefully more helpful. We are looking forward to a return visit post CoronaVirus. in a couple of years and we hope that things will have stabilized with respect to some of these issues. Thanks for the opportunity to provide feedback and let me know if you need any more information.
