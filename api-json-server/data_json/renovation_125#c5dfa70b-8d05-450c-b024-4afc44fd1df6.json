I get that this is a cheap hotel but at a minimum you expect the plumbing to work properly and the bed to stay together.

Come to find out the frame was not held together by any screws or bolts. It was simply leaning together so all it took was displaced weight and the whole thing broke.

The check in an check out was fantastic. There is so much to write in here I could write a small book. The staff was fine professional. The things I am talking about have nothing to do with the check process. There is so much maintenance that needs to be done to this hotel it is not even funny. I do not know how many maintenance workers they have working there but they need more. it is simply more issues than one person can handle. I had to remove a plastic bag from the smoke detector that someone who stayed in the room before me had wrapped around it so they could smoke in the room an it would not set the smoke detector off. This by the way is a violation of the fire code. Funny thing is some one on the house keeping staff should have noticed this. I am jus sayin.

The staff is nice and tries their best but can not keep the quality above water even for a bargain hotel. Our first room had half the power out so we got a second room. That room had a flashing phone that never stopped blinking brightly during our entire stay even though the front desk staff tried to shut it off a cracked toilet a TV remote that did not work the blow drier had fallen off the wall in the bathroom and a heater that only had the settings full A C and full heat. Garbage sat in the halls throughout our stay. The bathrooms do not have fans in them which leads to them always being damp and the ceilings are molding and discoloring. I am generally pretty tolerant since I realize I chose an inexpensive hotel so I could save money for stuff I really want to spend it on but this dropped below the bar even for me. The staff was friendly and tried their best to help within their power. The hotel is cheap about 10 15 night cheaper than other local big namesSerious maintenance is needed. They are not able to keep up with the simplest of things like replacing broken toilets or TV remote batteries. Greenville has a great childrens museum Dave Busters is nearby.
