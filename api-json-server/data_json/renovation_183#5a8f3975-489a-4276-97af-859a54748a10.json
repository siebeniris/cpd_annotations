Stayed one night for a boat ride at the harbor. Hotel is conveniently located off of I95 and the perfect location for hanging out in the Baltimore Harbor.

All the Lamps have sockets which is always very convenient. Bed was comfortable slept well. Connected to the Gallery mall which really did not have much of a shopping selection to offer although the fourth floor was closed for renovations.

Came in from a long night of exploring the city and found that the sink was not draining. I was to tired to call the front desk to resolve this since it was 4 am in the morning. So the water just sat in the sink. I am assuming that the room next door was clogged too because I can hear maintenance using the plunger around 8 am. Maintenance came and knocked on my door at 830am to say that they needed to unclog my sink to fix the room next door. I was planning on sleeping until 1030 check out at 11. before I hit the road. So my girl friend and I had to rush to get our clothes on and pack our bags since several men were in and out of the room. did not even get a chance to brush my teeth. Called the front desk and they just blew me off saying we were not aware of what was going on and just said sorry have a nice day. Last time I stay there.

Stayed at the renaissance for 2 nights over the Memorial Day weekend. Chose the hotel for its location overlooking the harbor and we had a great view from our room. Self parking was in the general garage for the shopping mall but valet was available. The hotel lobby was lively and modern with fresh lemonade and water available for free. Staff were friendly and helpful although we had to wait for an hour for new coffee supplies to be sent to the room after the daily service had omitted to replace them. Overall the room was comfortable but decor was dated and the hotel could do with a makeover. We were on the 9th floor and there was a convention going on so waiting for 1 of only 4 crowded elevators became annoying.

Traveling for business this is in a nice location. But the property is very tired and in need of a facelift not nearly as nice as other Renaissance hotels that I have stayed in.

Asked for a restaurant recommendation that was local owned not chain the only one he gave me was Angies with brochure I was not impressed.

When we got to our room on Saturday the sound of jackhamering above us was deafening and gave my husband a headache. I called downstairs to see how long it would go on and was told that it was from noon to six. I asked for another room and we went downstairs to get one. Vivin came and helped us as we had to get in line again and ended up upgrading us because all of the other rooms we were offered had the noise problem. They are redoing the bathrooms in the place. If you will not be in your room between noon and six it \u2019s not a problem but otherwise discuss the issue with the staff and make sure you will get a room far away from the noise. I could understand putting us in a noisy room if it was after six as we were checking out the next day but it is a waste of time for everyone to put people in a noisy room like that. I blame the management for making that decision. The pool and spa were well kept and clean but the pool was very cold and I went into the hot tub to warm up after my swim.

From the Front desk to the Concierge Lounge I received impeccable care and attention. The hotel has been recently redone and it is very upscale clean and comfortable. There is still a slight odor in the hallways from perhaps all the new restoration. The tv which was large misidentified me. Sadly the channels offered were fewer than I expected no HBO or Showtime. The Concierge Lounge recently redone no longer carries straws or plastic bottles water is available by filling glass carafes. The room itself was bright functional and upscale. The staff was very helpful especially with all the new machines. While the stay was near perfect the major and serious flaw was the hotel restaurant Watertable. The breakfast buffet served cold food in their chafing dishes they do not work or no one checks the temp. Dinner was overly expensive but very underwhelming probably the worst meal I ever had at a Mariot Renaissance property. Stay at the Renaissance and be pampered. This is the best location for the Inner Harbor. But skip the restaurant.
