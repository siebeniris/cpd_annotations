At 20 night you expect a certain level of quality. It has the trappings of a Doubletree the nice comforter tiled bath and granite counter but I have never tried to sleep on a bed so hard in my LIFE. I am a side sleeper and this made my shoulders ache. Then there is the shower. I know how this type of shower handle is SUPPOSED to work and this just. well did not. The water ran for the entire first day because I could not get it to turn off. And that is after I had so much trouble getting it to give me hot water. I even informed the front desk about this non functional shower on my first day and after a FIVE DAY STAY nothing was done about it. When you give a place the opportunity to fix something by telling them what is broken they should AT LEAST make an effort. And that is all in addition to their complete screw ups on payment and check out. I had the room reserved for me by my company and they were given a credit card number FOR COMPLETE PAYMENT. It said so in the paperwork and everything. I have a print out. I check in and they told me that they had only charged ONE NIGHT to the company card and they would be charging MY card for all the additional nights. ARE YOU KIDDING ME. Even after we got that worked out and by worked out I mean my coworker had to go to the front desk with her card and pay for them. I got my check out papers slid under my door a full day BEFORE I was due to check out. I called down to the desk and was informed that I only had the room for 4 days instead of the 5 that we had reserved. Insert expression of the most extreme disbelief here. Again I had the printout from their reservation office that very clearly stated I was staying for 5 nights. The front desk transferred me to some other number that was supposed to see what they could do for me. That person then transferred me to someone ELSE. And that person said they would talk to the sales desk and have them call me back. I waited and waited no call so I marched down to the front desk with my print out to solve this where I was informed that they tried to call but nobody answered. So in addition to the shower not working I guess the phone does not work either.

We stayed here Dec 30 and Dec 31 2015 for a small New Years getaway. I booked far in advance and got an excellent room rate. This hotel was PERFECTLY located for what we wanted to do. Check in was super nice super quick and the free cookies were wonderful as we were starving from a delayed flight and long day. We stayed on the 10th floor and our family members meeting us in Chicago stayed next door as we were able to get online and pick our rooms next to each other the day before check in which I consider a nice feature. The room was perfect. Not small. Great bathroom and shower. Good amenities hair dryer shampoo conditioner lotion. The long seating nook next to the windows to view the Chicago skyline and into the offices next door was fabulous. I spent some time there just viewing into the downtown condos and offices surrounding us. Lovely. The room was easily heated and cooled. The beds were comfortable. The TV and all the furniture were updated. Everything was perfect in this hotel room plenty of storage for clothes a desk a chair etc. There was NO safe and of course I did not like that since we do not like to carry our passports with us but there was a big sign at the front desk stating they offered safes there. Location is the main thing with this hotel. It was perfect for our needs for this trip. We took the blue line from the airport 5 per person coming in to Chicago and 3 per person leaving Chicago and we took a taxi from the Clark Lake station to the hotel which was 5 or 6 both ways and we just gave the taxi driver 10 both times. Everything else was walking distance Navy Pier was 10 minutes maybe 15. Easy easy straight walk from the front entrance just turn left and walk about 3 or 4 blocks and you are there. The side entrance of the hotel is directly across from two fantastic eateries Timothy O Tooles which is huge inside and is a bar restaurant with great service and lots of wonderful options from fried goat cheese appetizers to bayou mac n cheese to wings and sandwiches to salmon. We had a family of five and everyone left happy. They also have 48 beers on draft and lots of drink specials. Next door to Timothys is the West Egg Caf\u00e9 which serves you quickly and friendly for breakfast. We had crepes pancakes chicken fried steak eggs bacon etc. It was all affordable under 10 per person and quick and good. We lucked out just walking across the street to eat twice. There is also a Whole Foods Market on the corner by the hotel that sells EVERYTHING liquor sprite sodas you name it they have it. They close early 9 pm. so go early. Down from Whole Foods is a 7 11 that has liquor sodas hot chocolate hot dogs and sausage dogs 3 for 3 etc. There is a Giordanos at Navy Pier but we walked to the one on Rush Street so we could walk past Magnificient Mile. it was about a 10 to 15 minute walk because we are slow. We loved Giordanos and we stopped at Garrets Popcorn on the way back to the hotel too. If you just want to walk up and down Magnificient Mile you are only 5 minutes walk away. The doormen at this hotel are awesome. Hubby and his brother had a good conversation with them about the KC Chiefs. They also watch who goes up and down and they have armbands so non hotel guests are not allowed up the elevators 24 hours a day. My husband was smoking outside at around 430am and almost did not get in because he forgot he had on his arm band. I liked this. The lady in the gift shop was super nice and chatty. I liked her. We took a taxi to Shed Aquarium Adler Planetarium and it was only 12. I gave the guy 20 because he let five of us in his little Toyota. So the only thing we did not like is the hotel has NO vending machines and the sodas in the gift shop are 249 each so make sure you go to Whole Foods Market before 9 pm or bring your own. Also I would give this hotel 5 stars but there is no microwave and the refrigerator is pre stocked with items for sale so nowhere to store leftover pizza or sodas while we stayed. We would definitely stay here again.

I saw people being issued rooms so I went back to the desk about 40 and was told she would try to find a room because she knew we had been waiting which was amazing since the guy right next to her said there would not be any rooms until 50 at the earliest. We ended up on a much lower floor with zero lake view but whatever. The room was clean but the bed has seen better days. in fact the mattress felt almost worn out.

Me and my wife stayed here during the 4th of July. The location was perfect and walking distance to the Navy Pier Millennium Park Buckingham Fountain and many restaurants. That is one of the primary reasons we booked here. As a Hilton Honors member when we check in at a Doubletree hotel we are offered cookies and bottled water. We did not get that initially when my wife checked in while I parked the car. The person who checked us in did not even worked at the front desk and probably explains why we did not get the usual cookies and bottled water. That person also did not give us the room I selected on the Hilton Honors ap and instead gave us a handicap room that did not have a bath tub. We had to go back downstairs and talk to someone who actually worked at the front desk to get this problem resolved. After speaking with someone regarding this matter the front desk person apologized and gave us an actual room similar to the one I had initially booked. We were also offered cookies and bottled water. We were also given breakfast vouchers for the incovenience and made things rightThe room was clean spacious room for a downtown Hilton hotel. The bed was very comfortable and slept well. The bathroom was clean but the shower lever was loose but worked. The parking was convenient and cheaper than the parking garage and open parking lot across the street. They also put a 75 hold on your credit card which was the first time that happened even as a Hilton Honors member staying at Hilton brand hotels in other major cities like Los Angeles San Diego Miami Pittsburgh and Washington DC. The pool area on the 5th floor was very nice and relaxing. It was nice that they had a bar serving drinks and chairs to relax. The one thing I did not like was the very slow elevators. During the busy 4th of July there were crowds of hotel guests waiting for the elevators and there were many in which some did not appear to be working. I would have rated this 45 but the process of checking in was not up to par as the other Hilton brand hotels we stayed at in the past. If you are looking for a good location within walking distance to tourist spots this would be the place to stay.

My only complaint is that I had purchased this stay on Priceline where all bookings are final. I specified that I wanted a hotel with a pool as we were traveling with our three children for a fun getaway. Once our booking was finalized and our hotel was revealed to us we were extremely bummed to find out this hotel only has an OUTDOOR pool which obviously is closed for the winter months. We contacted Priceline to switch to a different hotel with a pool but the DoubleTree would not issue a refund. Priceline said that the fault is on DoubleTree for listing it in this manner. This should not be allowed. An outdoor pool in the dead of a Chicago winter is not a pool and should not be listed as a pool. Would have given a higher rating if it would not have been for their dishonesty.", "offset": [620, 730], "date": "2019-12-19", "cpt": "2", "category": "general"}, {"id": 28, "uid": "c2fe7e6d-6476-48f2-8c1c-31c4ff92994e", "sentence": "Hilton Diamond Member Experience. I travel to Chicago quite a lot and as this hotel was recently renovated I had been eyeing it up with the intention of giving it a try as you never know when you will run across your new favorite hotel and end up coming again and again. I typically like to book suites as I like plenty of room in which to work. I booked the largest available which was the deluxe one bedroom suite. This room was truly lovely. It exceeded my expectation and was beautifully appointed and decorated with great amenities and had a wonderful space to work. I typically like to eat at the hotel as after a long day I do not like to go running around and I found the lobby bar and seating to be really appealing. This is a near perfect experience but we are sadly coming to something that just spoiled everything. Upon checking in the lady was very friendly until she handed me the breakfast vouchers then she became very uncomfortable explaining that both gold and diamond members get the same continental cold breakfast. But she told me to make sure and let them know that I was a diamond member as if that was going to get something more. Because of this 7 Charge I decided not to eat dinner at the hotel and to eat just down the block where for drinks and dinner my bill was 43. The next morning I went down and as I was being seated there was a lady who was a diamond member who was saying that her husband got a free breakfast but now she was going to have to pay 7 dollars I do not know what was going on with that but then my server said the same that I was going to have to pay 7 for a hot breakfast I decided to just opt for some coffee and a roll and then I can just hop down to Yolk where I can get my usual freshly cooked made to order 2 egg breakfast served with seasoned potatoes or cheesy grits. Toast pancakes or english muffin all for 850 and I do not have to get up and get it myself. I took the description right off their online menuLong story short I spend far to much money at Hilton properties every year achieving diamond status to be given the same benefit as a gold member. You have every right to nickel and dime the most loyal Hilton members if you want but by my calculation its risky because you just lost 5150 plus a generous tip for your server because I am not going to be treated this way. Why should a hotel affiliate with Hilton Properties. Because they get access to a ready made loyal clientele like gold and diamond members who the only reason they discover your hotel is because you are on the Hilton reservation website. Now that you have them you can if you choose deny them honors benefits like late check out and never give any upgrades basically you can conduct yourself anyway you see fit however my guess is people will frequent places where properties honor the benefits of the Honors program for gold and diamond members especially. For me it just comes down to breakfast I will not be returning over the 7 breakfast upgrade charge. One of my favorite doubletree hotels in Naples Florida gives me a hot breakfast for free the doubletree in Elk Grove Village gives me a hot breakfast for free the Hilton Suites Magnificent Mile gives me a hot breakfast for free. These are just a few of the places I return again and again because they know the value of my status represents in future business.", "offset": [572, 725], "date": "2019-12-28", "cpt": "2", "category": "general"}, {"id": 29, "uid": "28e4f3d4-d86c-4f87-85a8-e20547d44b84", "sentence": "They did n\u2019t have our reservation although they did get us another room.
