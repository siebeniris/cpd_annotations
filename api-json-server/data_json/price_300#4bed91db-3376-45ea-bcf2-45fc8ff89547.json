Breakfast was one of the best I have ever had at a hotel. The choices were almost limitless. The waiting staff were very attentive. Every staff member we came across was friendly and helpful. This hotel also has a pool and spa but unfortunately we did not use them as we were so busy seeing Berlin.

This is a nice hotel for a very good value in the centre of Berlin close to the Tiergarten and the KaDeWe. We stayed the first week for a conference and had an upgraded room that was large and beautiful. We then left and came back for one more night on our own without an upgrade and the room was nice smaller and less modern but still a very good value. The staff seemed very friendly. We had lost our room when we first arrived as my husband by mistake booked it for a night earlier than we arrived. While we were on a plane they gave our room away as we had not responded in 24 hours. The conference organizers helped us get another room somebody had cancelled but we did not understand why they did not just charge us for the first night and kept our room. In case you stay that is their policy. They emailed us but we were on a plane. I would 100 stay here again as I liked the location and the breakfast buffet is awesome. The free Wifi is very bad.

There are many many conference and meeting rooms it would be hard to imagine that this hotel could not accommodate your conference needs. Couple of things to highlight which might be interesting. useful. They have a 14 day cancellation policy or at least they did for the event I was attending. And they stuck to it. Unfortunately I had to cancel one of my nights about 9 or 10 days out but even though I heard reception telling someone else that the hotel had been full that night they still charged me 90 cancellation which I found a bit steep especially as most hotels that I use have a same day one day or 48 hour cancellation policy. The glasses of wine are huge and quite expensiveI had the Caesar salad with chicken and the salad was swimming in the Caesar dressing. Much too much and much too rich.

I have been staying here three or four times a year for the last fifteen years so write review every year or so. In the last year I have been in deluxe rooms and suites in the West wing and on the club floor in the other wing. I have to say I am not a fan of the standard superior rooms the upgrade to deluxe rooms is worth it for the extra space and the far nicer bathroom. This last weekend I was on the club floor which was lucky as there were big conferences on end of my stay and escapes from most of it there. The rooms on the 8th floor are deluxe rooms and suites those with even numbers have superb views over the Tiergarten and the monuments of Mite. The staff up there are friendly and helpful and do their best to look after everyone. From 5 pm the lounge is a nice place to have a glass of bubbly and some canapes before heading out to dinner. I paid a couple of visits to the Spa which was looking as good as ever it is even nicer when the terrace next to the pool is open to lay on. I rarely eat breakfast but when I do go down to it the selection vast covering EU countries as well as the Far East and some local Berlin treats. For me the location is perfect the street is not too busy but the 200 bus stops outside. Between the Tiergarten and the Zoo there is greenery all around three sides. The KaDeWe and Witenberplatz is a seven minute walk. Do things go wrong. yes sometimes but if there is an issue then talk to reception they have always fixed mine.

There is a lovely sitting area connecting the Marlene bar to the lobby. Keycard needed to use the elevator. At the room we discovered we were right next to the elevator. The elevator shaft was right behind our bed. That did n\u2019t become an issue with noise until the hotel got busy over the weekend. In fact we did n\u2019t hear a soul until the weekend. It seemed like we were on the floor alone. In the room we had a nice sitting area. There was a nice amount of closet space and areas to set your things. There is a fun selection of hot beverages to make in the coffee tea maker. There is one complimentary 1 L bottle of water per day. The minibar was expectedly overpriced. It \u2019s in a sensor so you must make do with the tiny space that is marked for \u201c personal use \u201d. We could barely fit a box of leftovers in there. The bed was crazy firm but it was still mostly comfortable. The pillows were a little too soft and I did n\u2019t know how to access the advertised \u201c pillow menu \u201d. I suppose I could have inquired but I did n\u2019t care that much. We used the pillows from the couch when we wanted to prop up in bed. The tv is viewable from both the bed and the sitting area. Cable in English are limited to news horse shows and Judge Judy. There are pay movies and a very few of them are free. Not why we were in Berlin anyway so none of this is an issue. The bathroom was beautiful and clean. There were nice toiletries and a no fog mirror. The provided bathrobes were very stiff so I did n\u2019t use mine. The deep soaking tub was raised so it was quite a big step in and out of the bath shower. Be aware of your footing. Also there is a space in the door that is perfect for water to leak through and soak the floor. We opted not to have breakfast at the hotel but we did check it out and it looked great for those who like to eat a hearty breakfast. We also did n\u2019t eat at any of the restaurants but the bar had a great selection good service and delicious free bar snacks green olives and Parmesan crackers.

One week at the Intercontinental for a leisure conference trip. Overall a great week \u2019s stay. Welcome on arrival was very good extremely warm and friendly. This was my first stay at an intercontinental since IHG introduced changes to the Ambassador programme earlier in the year. Whilst I am not a fan of some of these changes no longer providing fruit or a free movie we did receive a very good upgrade and welcome amenity of a 15 Euro account credit. The upgraded room was very large and whilst I think it was a Deluxe it was a junior suite by many hotel standards with a good sized bathroom. Everything in the room was good although my only issue was with the AC that was really just a fan rather than climate controlled air. As temperatures outside were around 30 degrees the room did get quite warm. We were supplied with another fan on request that helped the air to circulate in the room. I believe we were in the older refurbished wing so maybe this is less of an issue in the other wing. Overall service is excellent throughout the hotel. Breakfast is a vast buffet and sitting out on the small terrace area is a pleasant treat to start the day. Pool and gym were good too.

So how did the IC meet my confused expectationsThe room was small and definitely worth nothing more than four stars. While the bed was comfortable there was little room for anything else. A small desk and a chair was all there was not even a coffee table could fit in the room. As far as amenities are concerned there was a safe and a 05 L bottle of water replenished daily. But to get a toothbrush I needed to ask the maid. There was air conditioning but it could barely cope with the sweltering summer heat. The cramped bathroom came with a bathtub that had a handheld shower with adequate water pressure. Breakfast cost a whopping \u20ac 34 and was definitely not worth it. They claimed it \u2019s the best in Berlin but the breakfasts I \u2019ve had at nearby five star hotels are n\u2019t that different. It \u2019s served 630 1030 and was very busy at 930. They do n\u2019t walk you to a table just shove you in and since all tables were taken I actually had to ask them separately to find me a seat.

So I am staying in this hotel with my husband for over a week and today I was n\u2019t feeling well in the morning. Couldn\u2019t find my card and was already very late for breakfast so I thought maybe I will just get myself a new card on the way back. Anyways once I was done with the breakfast. I went to the reception to get the card and she told me she can not give me one since I do n\u2019t have my I d and it \u2019s a security thing. It was fine till then but what happened next makes my blood boil every time I think about it. She told me in a rather sarcastic tone that this room is not even booked under your name and I said of course that \u2019s my husband. Anyways she said yes because usually there \u2019s 25 euro extra charge for the second person. I told her how I was with my husband at the time of check in sitting right across while he was holding our son and also playing with him. I also mentioned how we stayed in the other hotel in N\u00fcrnberg and the lady there mentioned she is n\u2019t going to charge anything extra for me she noticed me herselfIn fact it always happens that the hotel tells us at the time of check in if they will charge anything extra or not. I told her I have my i d in my room so she said sure and sent a GUY along with me to confirm my identity. Now this guy entered the room before me I was completely embarrassed as I had all my things lying everywhere. he checked my I d and instead of leaving tells me how I should plug my phones charger somewhere else and put the telephone plug back on. I told him it was because of the baby that he starts playing with it. I could still receive calls anyways as long as it \u2019s connected to the cableAl this while I was shocked and asking them how could they not notice me when at the day of check in the lady who upgraded our room was chatting with my son and could see that i \u2019m also sitting there calling his name. She gave us two cards and two vip cards even because of the event that was happening. Also i \u2019m not till now hiding away in my room in fact I am having breakfast daily along with my son and they ask me for my room no every single time. Is your security system so flawed that anyone can come in the hotel and stay in someone \u2019s room and have breakfast using their name. I feel like this is the worst experience ever after staying in so many hotels for so many years. The lady should have gotten in touch with my husband or the person who did the booking that day. She SHOULD have given me a new key if she thought it could be only a misunderstanding mistake which she did say so. She must have sent a LADY to accompany me to my room. I felt ashamed and stayed in my room till my husband came.
