Where to begin. Prior to arriving we both had very high expectations of The Waldorf Astoria brand. The name just conveys a certain expectation. That of luxury and the epitome of service. It was to be the crown jewel of our 10 day four hotel vacation. We arrived at 30 with a baby in tow we had requested early check in. We received early check in at 359. Regular check in is at 40. We paid for a deluxe ocean view room. We were quite disappointed to discover you could only see the ocean by stepping onto the balcony and turning 90 degrees to the right In the online description and picture you could see the ocean from the bed in the room. They had no other options available even though our trip was booked well in advance. Upon talking to management about the issue it was agreed the hotel would waive the fee for the upgraded room type. However they never followed through with this so upon checkout this fee was still on the bill and the desk staff refused to waive it. The air conditioner never cooled the room even in the middle of the night. For the price of the room I expect the AC to work well enough to at least cool the room. The front desk staff was rude and snotty. However the wait staff was prompt and the the housekeeping staff were very friendly. We had a hit or miss experience with the concierge. The ice machine on our floor broke on the first night of our stay requiring us to go to other floors and eventually running dry those machines requiring us to go even farther for ice. We were on the top floor and much to my surprise someone suddenly knocked on the balcony door. They were sanding and repainting the outside of the building. It was a workman knocking to tell us we had to remove everything from the balcony so they could do their work. Also we could not use the balcony that afternoon because of this. The next day they painted the balcony so we could not use it then either due to the fumes. We were also blessed with scaffolding to block our already limited view and a lovely compressor noise from the power washer. No one informed us of impending maintenance while we were checking in. No letter slipped under the door or call from the desk or any kind of apology for any inconvenience we may have experienced from the hotel. Just a strange man on the balcony. The plates of food are huge and delicious but they never quite got the order right or all the things it said in the description. You would think when you order coffee they would bring or at least offer cream. We had to request the cream. All in all we were quite let down by the experience. When asked about our stay at check out disappointed was the response we offered to the agent. the hotels response to that was nothing. Upon seeing the billing issues and their refusal to fix it or take responsibility for getting it fixed having someone from management follow up with me and then having the desk agent be incredibly disrespectful to my face this hotel left a very bad bitter taste in my mouth. I would not recommend it to anyone who is expecting a high class exceptional service experience with luxurious amenities and finishes. If you want amenities or more dining options be sure to go next door to their other resort Casa Marina because apparently that is where everything is.", "offset": [1614, 1675], "date": "2015-05-29", "cpt": "0", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 3, "uid": "7dacf82e-4568-4638-bb2b-795d20bed8a3", "sentence": "Maid Service Pool service Air conditioning.

Just returned from a 4 night stay at the Reach in Key West. This was my first time in Key West and wanted to enjoy a non kid vacation with my girlfriend. I had concerns based on the reviews about the hotel rooms. I contacted the hotel back in January and Ernest Romo EJ promptly replied to my email. EJ informed me that there were 3 hotel rooms that had be renovated and they were demo rooms for the upcoming renovation starting in August. EJ went out of his way to make sure we got one of the renovated rooms and it did not disappoint. The interior was very modern nice couch area bed was very comfy and the bathroom was really wonderful. The staff at the hotel were amazing. Besides EJ shout out to Jese down at the beach cool dude always making sure we were setup at the beach or pool. The wait staff was also excellent. They have this great system that they have a pager for the wait staff. Works quite well and drinks were extremely good. We ate at the onsite restaurant for breakfast twice. They have a nice brunch menu on the weekend smaller plates really liked that option. The pool albeit small was clean and not overcrowded at all. The beach again not big but plenty of room was clean. However there was a TON of seaweed which the Reach tried to maintain by cleaning it daily. This is not a Reach problem Key West in general had this problem. To the point they closed certain public beaches. The smell was not good at all. However they groomed the beach daily but there was just so much seaweed. Was better to get out there in the afternoon was not as bad. Overall it was just a great stay. Highly recommend renting bikes from the hotel that is how we got around Key West given the lack of parking for cars. We also checked the sister hotel Casa Marina. Only the pool area. The place is massive and the pool needed some TLC. Nice wait staff as well. but so glad we stayed at the Reach.

She walked a few steps in and saw us and apologized and left. We followed and ask her why she was entering our room and she said she needed to drop off a coaster and a note pad. We spoke to management who seemed a bit dismissive of our concerns. 2. A member of our group inadvertently got off on the wrong floor and went to room 23 instead of her room which was 323. She scanned her room key for 23 and the door unlocked only for her to find some people in the room who were very surprised at her presence. She profusely apologized and left.

Our stay began w a call 2 days prior to confirm details I spoke with EJ and he assured us all was good. He was on staff when we checked in and took care of everything we needed He is your GO TO GUY at the Reach. Thru our entire stay he was on top of our everyone needs. Our room 317 was a nice standard double we are not able to get a diamond upgrade this stay it had a good view of the courtyard and decent view of the ocean from the balcony. The rug had a curl at the corner which became a trip hazard but we learned to manage it. All rooms were revamped and decorated nicely w hidden touches related to the area. Beds were very comfortable cozy. Adjoining room doors are thin so voices carry from other rooms so note tone. Did not hear anything from above or thru walls just door noise. Bathrooms are a bit small so keep in mind if you are a person of size like myself 65 wide shoulders. shower is tight. really no issues with rooms but rug all have refridge and safes. View was nice looking over courtyard and had partial ocean view from balcony rm 317 bit noisy thou from lobby walkway elevator dings. What truly separates this place is the Staf Four Marlins rest trib to Hemingway had good fresh food but the staff was Off the Hok Mark Elen Fernando Ruestam Francesca support crew were AMAZING. Everyone remembered our names made us feel so welcome Daily. additionally EJ called the CM one night to make sure we could be seated at the sister property for the Nat Champ game and drove us over in their shuttle. Beach staff daily was always ready to get lounge chairs umbrellas and towels not to mention beach wait staff bringing drinks and complementary Italian ice pops while sunning. Breakfast daily was great discounted if H Diamond never disappointed. There is a local bus you can get on fro free two blocks from hotel little deli store half black away 3 blocks from Southern most point Buoy. only minor issue we had was at check out our travel companions had some accounting issues with regard to room charges but it was remedied properly and all was fine.

We stayed here because it was newly remodeled and is the sister to the Casa Marina where we usually stay but it is needing renovation. To say The Reach was disappointment is and understatement.

The renovation is still happening and it is the noisiest property we have ever been to. Beeping back up alarms workers talking very loud and pounding on metal is everywhere starting at 8 am even on weekends. Also as stated in their website there is no in room dining. I called and you ca n\u2019t even get a pot of coffee and a couple danishes sent up for breakfast. I was told they are still waiting on a few moving parts for the in room dining but \u201c they could have it set up at the restaurant \u201d. Sounds like the only moving part needed is someone to bring it up to the room. We do n\u2019t use the cofe makers in the room after a bad experience with a bug in one once.
