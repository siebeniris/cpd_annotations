We booked this resort with great hesitation based on the great discrepancy of reviews on Trip Advisor. Now we see why. During our one week stay we had experiences that were both horrible and wonderful but our overall take on this stay was disappointing. We arrived after dark tired and just wanting to get situated. When given our room 024 on the ground level we were overwhelmed by the damp and musty smell that hit you as you walked in. I was prepared for this based on some of the other reviews. We unpacked our bags and settled in for the night. In the bright morning of a new day we awoke to a much better view of the room. I was shocked and aghast at the mold that was building around the a c venting the ceilings and all over the walls. The mold appeared to have been painted over but was again permeating out through the paint. The shower stall looked like a science project in various stages of mold muck and crumbling ceilings. The shower head was caked in mold looking like it had not been cleaned in years. I went down to the front desk asking to see a manager. He asked me to return after 1 pm when he had more rooms available and we could look at another room. We went down to the pool for the morning and returned as requested. Armed with pictures of my moldy room on my I phone he did not want to look at them. He said that a replacement room is being provided and that it was just about ready and that we could take a look at it. Our new room 2069 was on the third level. The room was slightly smaller than the previous one but it had a spectacular view overlooking the lush gardens and pool area. The bed in this room was a true king sized bed vs 2 full sized beds that were pushed together in the previous room. The cleaning lady was putting the finishing touches on the nicely assembled towel arrangements which were loaded with hibiscus blooms and petals as were the bathroom vanity. A couple of balloon arrangements decorated the headboard of the bed. I returned to the front desk and told him that the room was like night and day and we appreciated the switch up. We were a bit surprised when he asked us to not take too long in relocating to the new room as they had to get our old room ready for the next guests. Really. That room needed to be condemned. On the food and restaurants it is spotty at best. We ate at both the Specialty restaurants and in the buffet. The worst was at La Altagracia Steak house. This is the same location where they serve lunch polside all day and the service was the worst. The menu is pretty much pre set. Our Seafood trio appetizer was supposed to be three different seafood dishes but they were all the same. When we mentioned this to our server he did not understand more on the language difficulties later. When we pointed to the Seafood trio appetizer on the table right next to us with three different dishes as they were supposed to be he says to us all the same. A few minutes later he returned took our Seafood appetizer and that was it. No seafood appetizer for youMy steak like was like all of the steak that I had here overdone thinly sliced fatty and grizzly. My wifes lobster was surprisingly godLa Bodega Rodizio the Brazilian style restaurant with a wide variety of meats carved fresh from skewers had the potential to be good. Unfortunately everything was way overdone and dried out. What a disapointmentKristal the gourmet fushion restaurant was very good with the best wait staff that we encountered. This was 5 star dining with interesting taste combinations. The waiters were personable and fun and we enjoyed our dinner here. We also enjoyed Luigis Italian restaurant on two occasions. They had a great salad and pasta bar which served both hot and cold pasta meats cheeses and soup. You then get to order your entr\u00e9e off the menu. We both ordered the OsoBuco dish and it was wonderful. There were three great desert choices available and we were uncertain as to what to choose so they brought us all three. Dinner was topped off with shots of Limoncelo or Sambuca. Very niceWe had to try the Buffet for dinner as everyone said that it was great. In our opinion the menu was not much different than the lunch menu with the exception of adding a carving station for meat. The night that we were there they were carving lamb. We prefer to be waited on for dinner and our preference was the Specialty restaurants. Keep in mind that reservations need to be made in advance and these are taken in person at Luigis between 8am1am each day. You may make reservations for up to three days. Men must wear slacks for dinner. Ladies wore skirts sundresses slacks or jeans. We did have breakfast each day and the menu did not change. Be sure to try the fresh made juice bar with 7 different juice choices made fresh before your eyes The omelet station was my usual choice as I prefer my eggs prepared fresh to order. The breakfast was good with a nice variety. The grounds of the property are expansive and beautiful. They are well maintained and a pleasure to walk. Out of all of the Punta Cana RIU properties this one was the most photogenicThe beaches in Punta Cana are amongst the most beautiful that I have ever seen. Tall palm trees abound and they grow right to the oceans edge. The beaches are wide and the sand is spotlessly clean almost like sugar. You can walk for miles in either direction and just enjoy the view. The water is the most beautiful turquoise blue you have ever seen. The ocean was fun to swim. Yes the waves can be aggressive at times but the water is very clean. Ok that is the good now for the bad. The language barrier. there is definitely a problem in communication with the help at this resort. do not get me wrong they are pleasant and most of them work hard. But if you do not speak any Spanish you are going to have a hard time getting through. The staff understands most one word requests beer water coffee spoon. But try to string 4 or 5 words together in a sentence and they will look at you like you have three heads. If at all possible try to learn some brief conversational Spanish before going you will be less stressed out. The drinks are very inconsistent. Depending on the time of day who your server is whether you tip or not and what bar you are at will all depend greatly in the quality of your drink. The best drinks hands down are in the Martini bar in the resort lobby. This bar serves signature and good quality drinks with top shelf liquor. Tip nicely here and you will be well taken care of. The drinks at the pool bar are best when you go to get them yourself. When served polside they often are weak and service can be slow. We tipped usually a dollar each time and the help did remember us and came around more often. The drinks were better too. We were surprised how many people did not tip as these folks really do work hard to serve you. Make sure that you bring plenty of sun block sun tan lotion and all of your toiletry products. For northerners like us the sun is intense here. We started with SPF 50 and had to move up to an SPF 80. The price for this small bottle cost us 28 on Caribbean Street a small RIU operated shopping district. I enjoy working out and the gym facilities are pathetic. The gym located in the Spa area had just a few treadmills one bike and a Universal weight machine with 2 of the 5 stations broken. The facility was worn and dirty. There were no towels no disinfectant supplies available and the water cooler was dry. The second facility on Caribbean street was worse. It is second floor above a store front. This one had some free weights. The bars weights clips and everything was very badly rusted and smelly. The universal weight machine was well worn with tattered and broken benches rusted chains and pulleys and it just looked hazardous to use. One of my biggest concerns this whole trip was of the safety and quality of the foods and drinks that I was consuming. It was most difficult to remember that all of the tap water in the resort is not potable. Yes bottled water was widely available but it is hard to remember like when you are showering and brushing your teeth. Regardless we were careful and did not screw up. Regrettably I write this review sick at home for 5 days now with a bacterial infection. My doctor says that I likely caught this in the Dominican as the symptoms that I suffer do not compare with what he has seen locally. I should have trusted my intuition on this one unfortunately I wanted to give it a try. We will never return to the Hotel RIU Palace or even to Punta Cana for that matter. There are simply too many other places to visit without jeopardizing your health.", "offset": [4659, 4718], "date": "2015-04-24", "cpt": "0", "category": "restaurant"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "b38dc535-2e2f-45e5-b6aa-3f1ef844d0d7", "sentence": "Relaxing Awsome Vacation April 25 May 2 2015. I have to say that after reading some of the reviews I was a little nervous when going to this resort. HEY YOU FROM ILLINOIS WITH YOUR ONE STAR REVIEW what resort were you at anyway. The resort was beautiful and had some of the Dominican charm with lots of wood in the common areas. The grounds were kept immaculate by the crew only drawback is the smell of the water from the sprinklers. I went with a girlfriend of mine and we were looking for a relaxing week with no hassles and really had not planned on any excursions. This was my 8th time at the DR but my first time at this resort and my friends first time at an all inclusive. We did do the 12 day Dominican Country trip and it was very interesting I had brought a suitcase full of school supplies and the teachers and the children at the school we visited were so excited. It was hot so make sure you wear a hat and sunscreen. We also did the Dr Fish Spa excursion this was indeed the highlight of our vacation it was the best 1500 I have ever spent in the DR. Out on the ocean massage yoga exfoliation treatment neg ion detox floating on the water lunch and relaxing. You could not have asked for anything more perfect. As for the service we had no issues all of the staff that we dealt with from the front desk to the maids to the bar staff were gracious and they always tried to help you outI always tip my servers maids and waiters and waitresses one american dollar is much appreciated. There is free wi fi check the envelope that you get when you check in the login info is on the front of that. We had the wi fi cut in and out a little but it is free what do you want it is available in the resturaunts and in the lobby and main buffet area. The staff at the front desk was always willing to asit if we were having issues. There were many food selections and if you could not find something to eat you should not even go to an all inclusive. This is the DR people you are not dining at the Keg. Of course the beach is by far one of the best in the Caribean so no issues there. Please do yourself a favor and do not look at the negative reviews. these people are looking for a Diamond status resort and they should just shut up and go there if they are willing to shell out the extra couple of thousand dollars a week to have their butt wiped for them. I will certainly refer this resort to friends and family. Keep up the good work. P S I love Spugeti he was at the Serenis both times I travelled there and he does an amazing job keeping us all smiling. Thank you for a wonderful time. Hola until we meet again.

On arrival we received a drink and transfer to our room was quick. The room was in a good position with partial sea view which was very good. but the disappointing smell which was stale and feisty. I also had to get staff to spray the room which we realised we had mosquitos. We could not use the drawer space we lived out of our suitcases I was not putting clothes in drawers which were stale. I was not convinced the top covers on the bed were clean since I found a stain and my daughter told me to smell the pillows not good. The bed was dreadful not comfortable at all. I found the room quite depressing the hotel needs a total makeover the best thing about it is the building not the interior. the shower water did not go down the plug I reported this but this was not fixed we were stood having a shower in dirty water from our sun creams and shampoo it was disgusting. The buffet restaurant had no sanitizing gel on entry or exit. we hardly ate anything in the two weeks there was always a problem with flys. if we booked a restaurant the food was freshly cooked the steak was good the Italian was rubbish I had lamb we were told the lasagne was rubbish my daughter had fish. this hotel did not match up to the Riu in Mexico last year. The entertainment was rubbish the show would start at 2145 and be over by 230. no disco then dancing in couples not catering for the younger people the Vegas show was 30 minutes and 15 minutes to thank the entertainers. The Wi Fi was never working even if you woke up in the early hours so this was not because too many people were using it. It came to our attention that two American couples had 2 towels each so they had one for the beach and one on beds by the swimming pool and these beds had towels on them before 8 am and before the towel man came but what annoyed me I never saw all 4 of them using the beds it was just a base for them. As far as we were aware it was one towel per person. The best thing about the hotel was the staff the drinks service round the pool area was very good and in the eating areas our room was cleaned every day and clean towels. Our trips were fantastic this was what made the holiday swimming with dolphins etc. this was a very long flight and not quite lived up to what we paid for the holiday and expectations. we went to Coco Bongo and this was virtually the same show as last year in Mexico.

Stay away from Riu Palace Punta Cana. You been warned. The intention of this review is to help others to find a better place to stay that the Riu Palace PC however it is particularly directer to Roni last name. the main manager of this terrible place the Riu Palace PC First of all we are travelers. I want to mention that I am very sorry for the ones who give 4 stars to this hotel because it means that you have not experience a real 4 stars hotel. My wife and I have been traveling to many countries. China Japan Canada M\u00e9xico Spain United Kingdom France Italy etc. etc. But we never have such a horrible experience. Roni The Riu Palace Punta Cana is a magnificent building that it is falling apart in pieces. The lack of attention to detail from your part is causing this hotel to deteriorate rapidly. I REALLY THINK THAT ALL THE POSITIVE REVIEWS GIVEN ARE ACTUALLY FAKE AND THAT YOU HAVE PEOPLE ACTUALLY WRITING THOSE REVIEWS. Shame. Using all the thousands and thousands of dollars you charged all of us for visiting your hotel you can actually make a difference. YOUR EMPLOYEES ARE SO AFRAID OF YOU. THEY SAY NOTHING IN FEAR OF LOOSING THEIR BAD PAID JOB. THEY ARE OVERWORKED AND UNDERPAID1. The property needs a desperate TLC tender loving care everywhere. All toilets around the building are leaking and continuously flushing. This leads to tons of water being continuously wasted this does not help the environment and it is a waste of money. Suggestion organize an efficient team of plumbers from the ones you already have there and instruct them to make sure all toilets work properly. You will save lots of money2 FOOD. We paid lots of money to come to Riu Palace Punta Cana to eat the cheapest commercial food ever. Food is in bad condition because you do not have air conditioner at the restaurants the same food is exposed all day long for people to eat the restaurant Don Manuels doors and windows are open flies are everywhere the food taste bad it is either raw or over cooked. YOUR POOR EMPLOYEES ARE SUFFOCATING WITH THAT RIDICULOUS UNIFORM. HAVE YOU EVER WEAR THOSE RIDICULOUS CLOTHES. DO IT. My wife got sick from eating there and when we reported it we where told that this was the first time this ever happened here. What a lie. We talked to many other people in the hotel and many of them got sick from eating your rotten food. Suggestion. you charge around 150 250 per night use this money to provide your customers with quality well prepared food. You have great chefs and cooks give them the opportunity to surprise your dinners with a delicious well rounded food creation every day. Have a theme dinner every night do not repeat the same food so often have imagination please. BE SMARTAIR CONDITIONER is the key to keep the food from going bad in a couple of hours. This hotel is located in a country blessed by the Sun. Cover your hotel with solar panels so you can have an inexhaustible source of energy. Think and act before is too late3. DRINKS ARE AWFUL. You force your poor employees to serve the cheapest alcohol to customers. Would you drink those mojitos with putrid mint4 POOL. So little pool so dirty so greasy so turbid so full of nasty drunk smokers. No restroom close to the pool means that 100 of people pees in the pool. The so called entertainment at the pool is so noise that our vacation was far relaxing. Suggestion. Have a pool cleaning team not just two poor employees just to clean disinfect and sanitize the pool every night. Scrub all the black and greasy spots and filter the water every night fix and replace all the missing tile do not serve drinks in disposable cups do not serve straws. Take care of the environment. 5 SMOKERS. Many people is trying to live a healthy life and do not smoke. There is no place to go in this hotel for this people. Smokers should not smoke in the pool or outside of the restaurants. Give the give of life to all your visitors. 6DO NOT ABUSE YOUR EMPLOYEES. They have a sad face a frowning face because they do not have breaks they work so hard and long hours for a bad paid. 7WHY YOU do not HAVE WOMEN IN THE RECEPTION OFFICE OR AT ANY OTHER KEY POSITIONS. ALL CHEFS ARE MEN. hm8ROM SERVICE food is the worst9Specialty restaurants are just recycling the food from one another and putting it in decorative ways over nice china. You did not trick me on this one. I noticed how the food from the morning is recycled all through the day redecorated refurbished reheated. Sad. 10 WIFI. The hotel claims that there is free Wifi in the rooms and everywhere. This is totally false. Wifi does not work telephones do not work showers are either cold or hot. This hotel needs new management. SOMETHING NICE. Some people is nice. But the best thing on this hotel was the Polish Violinist. He was great. KUDOS FOR HIM. RIU PALACE PUNTA CANA IS A FIASCO. THIS IS A 2 STARS HOTEL OLD BUILDING AWFUL FOOD WORST POOL NOISE AND TOXIC WITH ALL SMOKERS EVERYWHERE.

We recently stayed at the Riu Palace Punta Cana. This was our first trip to the Dominican Republic. Though the hotel was extremely nice it was not quite what I had expected. This is probably the oldest of the Rius in the area. The rooms themselves were clean and fairly updated though on the smaller side. Unles you pay the upgrade your view is an interior garden and on the balcony side we had the side road and construction. I do not believe there are any ocean views here. The exterior can use some fixing up. Only 1 main pool plus a small infinity pool. The beach itself is amazing. The food was good but not great. As for the restaurants they were all acceptable except for the Brazilian steakhouse where most of the meats were quite dry. The service was impeccable especially at the main buffet.

We returned from the RIU Palace Punta Cana yesterday after an amazing two weeks holiday. Needless to say I was worried before I went out with the bad reviews on trip advisor. However we had a fab time the staff are all amazing a couple of dollars tips a day goes a long way if you do not want an early start everyday tip the towel boys a few dollars a day and they will save your sunbeds for you. We only ever had one issue with our beds where someone tried to remove our stuff claiming it was there beds. My only disappointment with\u200b the hotel is the evening entertainment they have a mini disco for the children at 8 pm for 30 mins where all families are sat inside then at 830 the entertainment goes outside until 945pm. You are literally sat there in silence and in the dark with children until then. Not really the best regards entertainment if you ask me. The RIU entertainment staff all speak Spanish and if you ca nt speak fluent Spanish they will completely ignore you. Yes the hotel is dated and requires a make over but considering its such a huge place it is still looking great and we loved the old fashioned d\u00e9cor. We were also advised by Thomson before departure that the RIU Bambu next door was being refurbished and there would be a little noise. It has pretty much been demolished and is a building site. You can hear the building work by the pool and while eating lunch in the beach front restaurant. Again not really ideal when your trying to have a relaxing holiday.

This is the first time we went to an all inclusive resort but have been on many cruises. My impression of staying here was like being on a cruise on land. The grounds are lovely and well kept. The lobby area is stunning we commented that it reminds us of what old Florida or Cuban hotels may have looked in the 50s. Check in was quick and our bags were delivered by bell service quickly. Others have mentioned that one thing that needs to be changed quickly is that the rooms have keys instead of cards and the room number is actually on the key. The safe is free and recommended but it also is opened by a key. Many people have written reviews about being disappointed in the rooms. This resort is scheduled for refurbishing this spring summer. I thought the rooms were spacious and lovely. This is an ocean front resort of course the rooms will smell musty. The decor is a bit tired paintings are faded bedspreads are old mattresses need changing out. However our air conditioning was working well and I did not see any mold or mildew anywhere. Our rooms were cleaned every day. There is a minibar in each room with liquor available coffee maker and soda and 15 L bottles of water replenished each day. My husband asked for beer and there were always a few cans in the fridge. When we checked in the room we paid for was not ready and they compensated by upgrading us to a room facing the courtyard. The minibar was not stocked and we requested re stocking. It did not happen that day and we mentioned it to our excursion representative and she said she would take care of it. When we came back to our room to get ready for dinner the mini fridge was overstocked and there was a bottle of wine on the bedside table with an apology letter. We did not have any problems after that. Do ask for a room on a higher floor and as close to the pool as possible. They do have music and dancing until late and rooms closer to the lobby will have noise until late. The sports bar even though it is open 24 hrs is nothing special. The pool is great the bar staff is very accommodating and attentive. The entertainment staff is great they have activities starting around 130 am and they are there until 6 pm. THEN they change clothes and go to the courtyard to entertain in the evenings. I wonder if they ever get to go home. The food is good not great and plentiful. The buffets have numerous choices I could always find options that I liked. Lots of seafood lobster crab claws mussels shrimp caviar rare tuna rare salmon and tons of fresh fruit. As others have stated the meat was not the best but not terrible. Options for the kids also. I am a wine drinker and my wine glass was never empty. It was passable and plentiful. But to me the staff was the best I have encountered. Everyone worked their hardest to make sure we had what we needed they were so friendly and so hard working. Always a smile never a frown.

It \u2019s really just the inside that needs work ASAP. My boyfriend and I kept joking that we felt we were on the titanic. The hotel will be refurbished soon so hopefully they will update the decor. This place is huge but they need more restrooms outside. There \u2019s only one near the pool in La Altagracia restaurant. The male waiters were extremely pleasant and provided excellent customer service. The female waitresses need some sort of customer service training.

If you \u2019re looking for burgers they are usually cold as they are sitting out for a while during lunch. It would be nice if the hotel had food service by the pool or atleast a place where you could grab a sandwich or snacks. As for dinner we only went to two specialty restaurants. Krystal was GREAT reminded us of a high end restaurant back home highly recommend it and La Altagracia was good as well but would have liked to see more side dish options every single plate comes with potato wedges and advertise chimichuri sauce but they do n\u2019t give you any. The entree options were very good steak lobster etc. Drinks were pretty and tropical looking. They only serve Presidente beer and the liquor is not top shelf. They do n\u2019t have bottled water at any of the restaurants but the fridge in the room was stocked with soda beer and one liter of water.

This was our first time ever in the Dominican Republic however it was n\u2019t our first in a RIU hotel. We were looked after from the very start to the very end by absolutely everyone. The hotel itself looks amazing from every angle and is very respectfully clean hands down to the maids. Our room was FOREVER clean and we always got asked for a turn down service or any extra drinks with the mini bar which is free and includes alcohol and the room service is free too. The hotel cater for pretty much anything the shops on sight were great as was the bar service pool service hands down to matos and the beach may I add there is ALWAYS a sun lounger available anywhere. They had so much selection of food that was DELICIOUS I have to thank all chefs and staff service during meal times both breakfast and dinner. My partner enjoyed the steakhouse and Italian whereas I loved the Japanese and buffet themes. This was by far the best RIU for food meals the mainly male staff during our meal times sorry names have been forgotten deserved every tip we gave as they treated us like king and queen we felt very loved and ALWAYS had a smile on their faces. The extra activities that me and my partner associated ourselves with on site were the Splash World water park. was so much funTenis Ping Pong Gym and Riu Pool Party which is themed on certain days. We also Recommend the Tui Trips that were BOOGIE ADVENTURES and SAONA SUPREME. We CANOT thank Jonathan our Tui Rep enough for his help with not only our trips but also the information he gave about the hotel his English is impeccable and I was sad to have missed him before we went to give him a tip for how grateful we were. The entertainment team outstanding and so hilarious at the pool side activities there is so much entertainment I enjoyed all of it from the dancing Acrobatics Circus Magic Show To the Variety Show. The only thing I can recommend is maybe to add some other different things with the entertainment such as a Talent show maybe and a Proper Magic show in which you have someone playing cards etc I felt like a couple of nights they were very similar to each other in terms of acrobatics and performance but otherwise it was enjoyable. We had such an amazing holiday and disappointed is an understatement when coming back home. The only concern and frustration I had during the stay was the language barrier for us English speakers I only assume this is because English is their third language.

Sunny warm weather. 3 If I stopped my review here I \u2019d give a 5 however. Low lights Front desk housekeeping maintenance staff. I unfortunately had 4 rooms during my 6 night stay. 305 key would n\u2019t work for me or the staff 3020 a c was n\u2019t working maintenance guy tried to sell it as normal temp but my friend \u2019s a c in 3036 worked just fine was noticeable cooler. 3041 funky odor but choose not up say anything since this was my third room upon arrival until the ants showed up in the bathroom. Front desk \u2019s resolution was to send housekeeping with Roach spray which she proceeded to spray all over the floor towels. We did n\u2019t speak each other \u2019s native language so she did n\u2019t understand that no that was n\u2019t an acceptable solution. Front desk sent her back a 2nd time with fresh towels she wiped the roach spray off the floor. She finally came back a third time with a mop bucket however the room smelled of roach spray. Front desk would not offer a new room but instead sent housekeeping up and a new lady with some attitude said she \u2019d \u201c clean \u201d my room flashing her bottle \u201c Air Freshner Apple Scent \u201c. I let it drop until the ants came back I was moved to 3028 toilet runs both electrical outlets on each side of the bed do not work. Also when I reported the ants were back the front desk acknowledged that spray does n\u2019t work they have to use the powder in order to kill the nest. Not cool they knew this all along this my lower rating. Food was ok. Not awesome but I \u2019ve had worse. My friend had no issues in her room. Understandably I see why the online reviews differ so dramatically. Good luck.", "offset": [53, 137], "date": "2018-12-29", "cpt": "1", "category": "restaurant"}, {"id": 12, "uid": "bd6ef37b-9c01-4806-857d-7f8beba72be7", "sentence": "About As Much As You Can Ask Of A Reasonably Priced All Inclusive. let us start with the staff though a lack of English proficiency may require some moderate effort of Anglos part the personnel at the Palace were truly exceptional. Smiling faces and prompt attention with a genuine desire to accommodate guests needs were demonstrative. the norm. You can not fake nice and management is to be commended for the results of their hiring practices and supervision. The physical facilities offer pretty much whatever you might desire and they are kept up immaculately. The pools are spotless and the beach welcoming sandy and clean. If there is one potential downside to the beach for some it is that it is public. So be aware of your valuables just common sense really. There are plenty of lounge chairs at the beach and ample palm trees for shade when desired. One is issued a towel card per person at check in and you can exchange your towels throughout the day as often as the desire to do so takes you. The food was well above the norm for a non truly exclusive overly expensive all inclusive. If you can not find something to satisfy your desires you are really either not hungry andor not looking. The buffets have something for everyones palette. The assortments of fresh tropical fruits at all times were a treat as were the pastries. The bakers do any outstanding job on both the deserts and numerous varieties of breads. Though we sampled the specialty restaurants come early they do not take reservations and fill up quickly and were satisfied with all of those which we sampled being the Japanese Spanish Haute Cuisine French and Steak Lobster the buffets are expansive and highly diverse among their offerings. Like I said if you can not find somethings to satisfy you you are not hungry andor not looking. Made to order eggs omelettes stir fry and a host of various regions foods are on offer. The grilled BQd chicken at the pool side snack bar was surprisingly tasty and made for a pleasant and quick lunch. there is plenty of sea foods on offer as well. Burgers and fries are on offer virtually all of the time should you be traveling with childrenThe rooms renovated over the summer of 2018. are extremely well maintained by the staff they come in twice daily to clean make up the room and replenish the beverage supply in the fridge. The bar and fridge were adequately stocked with Vodka Stolychneya Rum Brugel a local DR product. though not their top label and Gin Gordons. The fridge contained a surprisingly pleasant local the most popular DR lager pilsner style beer Presidente. Unfortunately for my tastes the establishment is a Pepsi products one. there is something just wrong about making a cuba libre without Coke though you can purchase Coke at their shop. Liters of water were amply provided and refreshed as well. A footnote about water it is advisable to use bottled water in your rooms to drink and brush your teeth with. Otherwise the water served in the restaurants and the ice used for drinks are all adequately safeguarded and we experienced no gastrointestinal issues whatsoever. So relax in that regard. Please remember to tip your housekeeping staff their wages are low and they depend on gratuities and they earn the your consideration. For those whom might wish to work off some of those calories yoga classes and exercise classes in the pool at the beach and elsewhere take place at various times and those conducting them are very pleasant people. there is a sports bar with food if that is your thing the NCA Tournament was taking place while we were there and there was a contingent of Michigan State fans ensconced at the Sports Bar when we passed by. Evenings entertainment is somewhat limited this is not Broadway Vegas or a substantial cruise ship but we found some of the musical offerings pleasant and sufficiently diverse to satisfy our needs. For our trip at the end of March early April apart from a little rain a nature imposed siesta the weather was delightful. Though we did not venture in it is my understanding that the casino is operated by a separate entity so I have nothing other to add to that. For a week or so if you want to relax dine drink swim golf snorkel dive dance enjoy some excellent coffee top notch cigars etc etc this is a near perfect venue to do so. When arranging your flights be sure to fly into out of PUJ Punta Cana if you can it is much closer to the resort than STI Santiago International Airport. Regardless of whichever airport be sure to pre arrange your ground transportation and avoid the various shills that will somewhat aggressively approach you. we had booked with Coming 2 and the driver that met us was extremely pleasant while his colleague loaded our bags and we settled into the spacious van he brought us some cups of sweet black Dominican coffee.", "offset": [1251, 1339], "date": "2019-04-13", "cpt": "1", "category": "restaurant"}, {"id": 13, "uid": "ad69311e-1b75-41ea-b2cd-92f0f1c0cdd1", "sentence": "the weather and resort are great.

There \u2019s dancing every night in the square with staff there to teach you if you \u2019re new games on the beach if you need to mix things up and staff are EVERYWHERE to assist you from getting drinks to planning an excursion. We dined every morning and every night at the buffet in La Isabella and each time Wily or Raul were there to greet us and get us a seat.

I traveled here with my husband for a spring break trip. The hotel was very clean and the food was OK. Not terrible but not the best food either. We did not do a room upgrade and so the view from our room was literally a wall and a roof top we could not see ANYTHING out of our window. The grounds were beautiful and well kept as was the weather. We never left the resort as there was everything we needed day or night right there many food options beach pool shopping even a water park. The main reason for me writing this review was because of a wonderful server we met while there Kelvin. He definitely went above and beyond to make us feel special and welcome. He was both a bartender at the swim up bar and a cocktail server in the evenings in the courtyard. He was warm welcoming not pushy and made us different special fruity drinks his specialties. We looked forward to seeing him every day and I have thought about him since returning home. Something that did concern me that I would like to look into more before traveling anywhere all inclusive would be the way the staff are treated and the hours they work. The staff at this resort tended work many days in a row for very long amounts of time. I hope they are compensated fairly and treated appropriately. I would like to know more about this.", "offset": [787, 879], "date": "2019-06-07", "cpt": "1", "category": "restaurant"}, {"id": 17, "uid": "825067e0-199d-47f2-a43f-56febe9b9db4", "sentence": "Sandy at the buffet.

The hotel entrance is beautiful to say the least. Check in is the normal process you give personal information etc. We were greeted with an alcohol free fruity drink. The clerk checking us in did not really give us a rundown on need to know details ie. restaurant locations where to get updates on entertainment etc. We did get a map with letters so tiny that you needed a magnifying glass. We ended up discovering things by talking to other guests2The room. The rooms are nothing like the photos. I would say that they were underwhelming at best. Clean most definitely but dated. Electrical outlets 6. Not six doubles but six singles. You may think that is plenty but 2 are in the bathroom and 1 is also hooked to the lights over the curtain. So if you do not mind the Beacon of light while you sleep you are down to 5. Also phone chargers do not want to make connection and nothing gets charged. No problem we called for maintenance. A man shows up with a flat blade screwdriver and procedes to stick the screwdriver into a live outlet to bend the connections. It did not really work but it is what it is. Rooms are energy saving and all lights and outlets are powered by your room card placed into a slot. In theory this is great except when you depart the room you can no longer charge your electronics. The water pressure in the showers is a dream come true. Excellent showers. Toilet rarely flushed on first flush. Often the toilet would be running when we got back to the room and once it overflowed. I mean badly. Used 6 bath towels to sop up the water. Maintenance blamed it on the use of toilet paper. Something to note. do not flush TP but instead toss in garbage can. Yuck3Staf. The entire staff was excellent. Always willing to please and always smiling. 2 employees of note were Sandy Santana our head waiter at the La Isabella Buffet Style Restaurant. He and his crew Ortiz and Marcos were outstanding. Our Room maid Berky Maria Javier was detail oriented. Our Room was spotless and she always had a nice towel animal sitting on our bed. 4Fod. Overall anything meat sucked. They overcooked every piece of meat every single day. The breakfasts were definitely the best. They pretty much had anything that you could think of. The only 24hr restaurant was the Sports Bar. Never ever ever changing the buffet selection of Dried burgers mystery meat hot dogs and kraut petrified breaded chicken strips and stale nachos with cold cheese sauce. 5. The Beach pool. They were never short on pool towels. 3 pools were clean and well maintained. The Beach had plenty of lounge chairs more than enough for everyone. Tons of washed up seaweed that they did not pick up often enough causing that rotting fish smell a couple of times. The waiters on the beach and by the pools were all very gracious and attentive to your needs. Pools close early at 630PM 1830. 6. Entertainment Probably the most disappointing aspect of the resort. If there was any you had to truck on over to the lobby to look at an electronic bulletin board and the message would not tell you the location of the entertainment anyway. 7. Coffee bar This was an afternoon lifesaver for us. After swimming all day having a delicious cup of cappuccino and a delicious dessert really hit the spot8. Spa. The spa services were excellent. The massages are very relaxing9. Airport transportation It was nice after a long flight to not have to touch my bags until I reached my room. We had Amstar who transported to and from the airport. They were professional and courteous. it is worth the extra money for private transportation. The reason is you could be traveling to several hotels before you get to the airport. No use having that anxiety added to your stress. A note about the airport They have no anouncementsso go to your gate and pay attention. If your gate changes nobody tells you. If you are like us you may look forward to a room with an ocean view. Unfortunately if that is the case do not choose The Riu Palace Punta Cana. The horseshoe shaped building only affords a handful of rooms that actually face the ocean. Even if you are able to get one of these few rooms they are so far back from the beach that you are not seeing much. Get the Mobile Passport Ap. it is safe and secure and you will not have long lines rentering the USA10. SafetyFor those feeling hesitant about going to the Dominican Republic do not be. it is safer than most American big cities.

Much respect and gratitude for Jerod aka Big Papi who is the crew DJ and keeps daily and nightly music upbeat and fun. He is also very knowledgeable in english and fun to talk to.
