Our room overlooked the pool so we were able to enjoy the Neon Trees concert from our balcony one night. I recommend checking out the polside concert schedule and booking a room overlooking the Boulevard Pool and strip for this experience. Or if you prefer to watch the Belagio fountain book a room on the North side of either tower. our friends had a room in the East tower on the 55th floor. They liked their room because they could look down on the fountain. I found the view to be too high to enjoy the fountain show. It made the huge fountain look puny. Also our East Tower elevators were never crowded. West Tower rooms are a bit quieter at night being away from the strip and the nightclub but their elevators were always packed. I found the East Tower much more convenient. When we got to our room at first glance the room was very impressive especially the bathroom. But now the negatives the rooms both mine and my friends had similar issues. were not cleaned to the level I would expect for a new 5 star at 300 plus a night and I am no clean freak. Prior guestss toiletries left in drawers balcony windows dirty and cigarette butts in ashtray no mattress cover on bed just a thin sheet sliding around on top of the mattress. When I asked the housekeeper if she could put a mattress cover on the bed the next day she said they ran out. I had to call a supervisor and then they came and used a bumpy blanket under the sheet. Bathroom was very nice and the tub had a huge window that overlooked the balcony did not get to try it out but it looked awesome. Shower water pressure was disappointing. Overall we loved the convenient location of this hotel and having a good sized balcony to sit on that overlooked the strip. Oh and we found the hidden pizza restaurant we had heard about.

I stayed here with my husband for 9 days during our wedding trip to Las Vegas in October and I absolutely loved this hotel. I think I \u2019ve found my Vegas \u201c home \u201d. I ca n\u2019t imagine choosing anywhere else now. For the first 6 nights we had booked a Terrace Studio suite but on check in we were given a complimentary upgrade to a One Bedroom Terrace suite with fountain view in the West Tower room 2703. We loved the location view from the room so much that when the time came for us to move to our next room \u2013 we had reserved a Wraparound Terrace for our final 3 nights \u2013. the amazing check in staff let us move into the suite right next door. They gave us they keys for our new suite without making us check out the other room allowing us to take our time and leisurely move our luggage from one to the other. If that \u2019s not great service and going above and beyond then I do n\u2019t know what is. Just one example of the outstanding service we received from staff while staying at Cosmopolitan. Both rooms were absolutely gorgeous with the standard Cosmo blue silver d\u00e9cor and some really great furniture. I particularly loved the bathrooms with double vanity units and rainfall showers they felt very luxurious. We used the Wraparound suite to throw a party so needed the extra space but for a regular stay the One Bedroom Terrace was definitely big enough. I \u2019d be happy to live in that romThe West Tower is further away from the Strip than the East Tower but the Strip views from the rooms are still as incredible see my photos. and it \u2019s also closer to Wicked Spoon buffet the Bamboo Pool which we went to almost every day. We booked through Virgin Holidays in the UK so had a few extra \u201c perks \u201d thrown in with our stay such as a free cocktail in the Chandelier Bar and free breakfast at Wicked Spoon EVERY DAY. Definitely a highlight if you can get this deal then go for it. We figured out that the Wicked Spoon bill for our stay should \u2019ve been over 60 without this. We also did n\u2019t have to pay the dreaded Resort Fee. Other Positives Balconies \u2013 Cosmo is one of the only hotels on the Strip with balconies so obviously that \u2019s their big selling point. You just ca n\u2019t beat relaxing on your own private balcony with a drink overlooking the Belagio fountains when you need to get away from the crowdsPols \u2013 I spent a lot of time at both the pools and I \u2019d say they \u2019re among the best in Vegas. Very well kept loads of sun loungers and good atmosphere. Bamboo Pool is great for relaxing and sunbathing we went here most days. One day I reserved cabana at Boulevard Pool for a group of 12 of us it was such a great way to spend a day with friends and get very drunkLocation \u2013 I love being in the centre of the Strip with so many bars restaurants and sights near you. Within easy walking distance you have Belagio Caesars Paris Aria City Centre and way more. There \u2019s also a great selection of restaurants within Cosmo from burgers pizza to tapas Greek food and of course the iconic Chandelier Bar.", "offset": [1659, 1847], "date": "2015-11-25", "cpt": "0", "category": "facility"}, {"id": 5, "uid": "6f71d09f-c53f-4794-a041-b7bcd7501e6b", "sentence": "Three wonderful days in Vegas. My two daughters and I just got back from our fun trip to Vegas. We were celebrating their 21 st birthday. I chose to stay at the Cosmopolitan Hotel. And we loved it. The location is perfect. it is a unique hotel because you can actually walk into the lobby right from the strip. There is a bus stop literally at the front door and what a convenient and inexpensive way it is to ride along the Vegas strip. The casino is not at all annoying and you can avoid it altogether before you get to your elevator. Rooms are comfortable and beds are amazing. Great hot shower with a rich stream of water.

We left our luggage and were told we would get a text when our room was ready. We did not get a text and had to queue again after 3 pm however lines moved very quickly. We called down for luggage which was delivered quickly by a very helpful employee. The room was very stylish the two beds were very comfortable as was the seating area. The bathroom was spacious but we found it odd that there was a blind shutter that could be opened between the bathroom and the bedroom. A few negatives the carpet in the room was very dirty as evidenced by walking around in socks and the elevators were very slow. While waiting on the ground floor for a bank of 6 possible elevators the crowds kept growing. We easily waited more than 5mins before one elevator arrived.

I stayed at the Cosmopolitan for a girls trip. We arrived at the hotel around 80pm on a Thursday night and did not have to wait in line to check in. We had booked a Terrace king room with pull out couch and were offered a fountain view for 50 more per night which we accepted. Upon entrance the hotel has a very modern and posh feel. The entrance and Lobby are not quite as extravagant as other hotels like Belagio or Caesars but definitely had a luxury feel to it. We stayed in the Chelsea Tower which was right near the check in desk and very convenient to the Uber Pick up area and Taxis. The boulevard tower is a bit more central to the casino and restaurants however our group was happy to be in the Chelsea tower with more convenience to the strip. There was also a great coffee shop right near the entrance of the Chelsea Tower called Va Bene which was very convenient. The room itself was stunning with the best view overlooking the Belagio Fountains I had ever seen. We loved the balcony attachment on the room something you had have to specifically book and the view upgrade was well worth it. The bathroom was very spacious even for 4 women to share and the beds were very comfortable. We enjoyed dining at the hotel at Beauty and Essex Milos and The Henry. We also enjoyed late night appetizers at CliQue followed by drinks at the Chandelier bar which is a must go to place if you are staying at the cosmopolitan. My only complaint would be the extremely slow elevators. I am not sure if the hotel was having mechanical issues during our stay with their elevators but it seemed as though only two were running. It took close to 15 minutes to get on an elevator on a Saturday morning and when we got on it was so packed we were squeezed in and stopped at every single floor. Several other guests were complaining about the elevator issues as well. The location of the hotel made it easy to access the strip.

Without doubt this is a very pleasant hotel to stay in. Its location is ideal situated as it is halfway along the main strip and handy for all the main ares of interest. My wife and I arrived on Monday Oct 23rd for a seven night stay after what had been a very long day travelling. It was however disappointing and frustrating to see that despite a large number of arrivals waiting to check in there were only 4 manned reception desks out of a total of I think 10 and it seem to take an age for each incoming guests to be processed. There was a member of staff controlling the queues but this in no way speeded up the check in procedure. Not an encouraging start but in reality the only shortfall we encountered during the whole of our stay. The housekeeping standard was excellent as was the level of service in the various restaurants and eateries. Nothing was too much trouble and staff went out of their way to please. The room was more than adequateCity room in Chelsea Tower over looking the pool with 2 Queen size beds and a huge shower.

The suite was huge with two full bathrooms and extremely well appointed. Housekeeping did an excellent job each day. There is an eclectic choice of restaurants in the Cosmopolitan but our favorites were Beauty and Essex and Rose Rabbit Lie. Both of these were incredible food and service. Elevators were fast for a hotel of this size and never had to wait more than a minute. The only real cons I have were that the entire first floor and casino had a much smokier smell than any of the other similar properties we visited. Also check in was over 25 people deep in each line and it was a Wednesday when we were checking in. They could do a much better job with this process.
