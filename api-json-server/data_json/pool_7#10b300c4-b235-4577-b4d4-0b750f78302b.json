First off we were able to get an amazing deal on our room. After taxes resort fees etc. we paid about 170 per night for the room. While full price is a little higher than I want to pay this resort is constantly offering deals. The room was a standard nice hotel room. It had a mini fridge and a Keurig coffee maker both were quite convenient. This is definitely a family oriented resort. This resort has 4 pools 3 of them specifically centered around family fun. there is a lazy river zero entry family pool with slide and basketball hoop a wave pool and a kids pool with water slides. They also provide life jackets for the weak swimmers. There is one pool set aside from the rest that is designated as adult only. They offer a mini golf course have a playground basketball court and even do kids only activities with their Camp Omni. Another bonus for us is that this resort is away from the Disney Universal International Dr craziness. There are plenty of restaurants and a Publix less than a mile away. We like to stay away from crazy busy areas and this was absolutely perfect. Really this resort is a vacation in itself without ever leaving the resort campus.

I have struggled writing this review swaying between a 4 and 5star experience. Ultimately I based my 4star circle. review on this simple question. How excited would I be to return. The answer in short probably depends upon when the return was to be. This was a staycation for us after cancelling a trip to the Florida Gulf Coast due to red tide. We live in Seminole County so we really wanted just a few days to relax and unwind with the kids. I suppose we accomplished that but not without issue. The Staff is Great oftentimes awesome. From arrival to bell service to the front desk the staff is 5star all the way. The hotel is nice and clean but in an odd way lacking in ambiance. They have this beautiful lobby overlooking a fantastic pool and golf course with a beautiful bar and courteous service but no music. no atmosphere. no ambiance. Just a big quiet room. Omni you are really missing the boat here. Put a Piano Player at that beautiful lobby bar piano and I guarantee you will cover the cost with bar sales. Heck we headed down early for a dinner reservation our first evening expecting to relax and have a glass of wine and relax and instead the space was dead. Rooms. Here is the deal. The suite we booked in the sunset lodge is just a big room with a couch and table but has no separation between bedroom and living area. We look for this when traveling with a toddler who needs naps and the suite. we booked here did not fit the bill. Worse yet the suite was in a separate building the Sunset Lodge which was like the red headed stepchild of the resort. It was kind of like staying in the econo lodge next door to the nice resort. Ok but certainly not the same. The front desk thankfully moved us into a nice room in the resort. It was smaller but had a beautiful balcony and was in the middle of the action. Thank youThe pool area is beautiful and great for kids. There is a fantastic kid zone water area wave pool and lazy river. Adults have their own pool if they wish. Nice bar at the pool music playing fun vibe. Now the issue the guests. They take towels handfuls of them and put them on chairs to save them for groups. The people though were completely obnoxious. Since I swam every morning in the adult pool before 8 when the family pool opened I got to witness the crew line up at the family pool hut for towels every morning. I personally witnessed 1 women get 15 yes FIFTEEN towels at shortly after 8 am and drop them on chairs so no one else could use them. Then of course the towels sit all day on unused chairs apparently when people leave they do not pick them up. so that when you actually want to use a towel or chair none are available unles you play this redneck low class white trash game yes sorry judgmental but come on people. Twice when I wanted a towel after my morning swim and twice when my family wanted them in an afternoon none were available. OMNI you can solve this issue. Make everyone account by room number for a towel and charge them if not returned. It sounds harsh but better that than letting the low class hogs take over your resort. Fireworks on Saturday Night awesome treat well done. Movie night was a bit weak due to a lack of available seating and floats including several empty but towel covered seats. My wife had a nice experience at the spa and I took golf lessons at Ledbetter both first class experiences. We ate on property for every meal and breakfasts and dinners were excellent. Shout out to Trevis for OUTSTANDING Service. The head chef gosh I wish I remembered his name was always there and took great pride in the food and presentation. They brought a special dessert for my daughter who has a peanut allergy thank you. I am not a big buffet fan but this one was really well done. We also ate in the Asian Restaurant and that experience was also excellent. All in all the hotel restaurant and services were fantastic. I did however feel a bit nickel and dimed. You pay for EVERYTHING they charge a 35 Resort Fee and then charge you on top of that for mini gold. Parking was outrageous considering this is Kissimmee not NYC. At the end of a long weekend I felt we had a nice time but for the very very frustrating pool experience but we certainly paid for it 250 for 3 nights and I am not sure we could have found better value per dollar at Animal Kingdom lodge see my review or at the JW Mariot or Ritz Carlton. Finally here is how I arrive at 4 stars instead of 5. I used to operate a nightclub. There you can have the best music system awesome drinks and a great facility but if your crowd is rough no one will want to come. Omni struggles with that issue. The crowd was rough especially the obnoxiousness at the pool.

I stayed at this hotel for three nights on business and attended a conference at the hotel. I visited and used almost all areas of the hotel so here is my usual balanced report and useful tips for future travellers. Here \u2019s what I liked. The hotel is large light bright and airy with some wonderful views from some rooms including mine of the golf course. The Reception area and conference rooms were modern well maintained and comfortable. My room was pretty standard but the bed was comfortable the bathroom was a good size and well maintained and I had everything in it I needed. I did n\u2019t have chance to use the swimming pools as I was there on business but I noticed they were huge and there was a good choice of quiet and serene pools some with wave machines and others with water jets and slides. There was something for everybody. I particularly liked the fire pits and evening lighting outside. It added ambiance to an evening stroll around the grounds. The Fitness Center gym was a good size and well equipped but see my comment below about access to it. Finally the food was good and not particularly memorable but the service was superb in all areas. Here \u2019s what I did n\u2019t like. The mark of a huge hotel like this is how they handle check out. It \u2019s totally predictable yet there was only one employee on the front desk so a huge line queue soon formed at 8 am when a guest had a problem and could not be checked out quickly. Clearly this is an expected regular problem as they had roped off a queuing line up area. I had to step out of the queue line to make a business call once I realized it was going to take some time. It is also worth knowing that this hotel is frequently used for large events. I was there for a conference at the same time as a ballroom Latin dance competition a teenagers \u2019 football soccer tournament and another conference. This made for an eclectic mix of guests noisy and boisterous teenagers and people with young children. The chill out pool is probably the only place you could get some peace and quiet. I also struggled to find somewhere to sit outside when I wanted to warm up from the over air conditioned conference rooms. There were very few seats that were n\u2019t sun beds. You also have to go outside to reach the Fitness Center. In the average Florida warm weather it \u2019s not a problem but worth knowing if you want to use the facilities in the middle of a thunder rain storm. Overall this was a good hotel but the checkout experience alone has brought my rating down from 5 stars.", "offset": [644, 864], "date": "2019-05-24", "cpt": "2", "category": "pool"}, {"id": 17, "uid": "83b339c0-27e1-4c63-aae2-bfe6744f6505", "sentence": "Beautiful resort it hang on to your pool towels.

A bit more than a restaurant down the road would charge but not unreasonably so. I believe my large plate of pasta and Italian sausage was 19 if that helps give you an idea. I have one complaint which I did share with hotel management. As a guest they give you a \u201c pool towel card \u201d. You trade the card for up to two towels at the pool. When you turn in the wet towels they give you the card back. Here \u2019s the kicker. If you do n\u2019t turn in your towels or if you do n\u2019t leave your pool towel card in your room upon departure they will charge you 25. WHAT. The card actually advises you and I quote \u201c Do not leave your towels unattended \u201d. This policy is very shortsighted.
