We opted for the breakfast and parking with our package which I highly recommend. Excellent valet and the food was delicious. We had an overpriced drink in their club at night and their dance floor and combo was fabulous. Next visit I would opt to stay at another hotel that is less expensive and enjoy their lounge which is open to the public. The room was clean no view and weirdly configured. The bed was comfortable. The TV had only a FEW channels. That was a surprise also considering the price. Guess you pay mostly for the service which is VERY good. They turned our bed down and left chocolates.

Firstly there was literally no one to ask where to go and when we arrived at the hotel lobby we were curtly told where to go as if it was a bother for the front desk clerk. Not only that but she clearly made me wait to say something instead of asking me if I needed help. Very bad start. When we did make it to the lounge area we had to pass through a bar area where people were walking in and around us. It was very unsettling that they do not have a designated area for tea where people will not be disturbed by random people walking in and out. Not only that but we were literally next to the bathrooms. We were seated on a low chaise type sofa with a small table in front of us. It was actually very difficult to eat on the table and we were reaching rather uncomfortably for things at times. The tea service itself was lackluster the tea sandwiches were miniature bitesize tiny bits and the scones were cold all of the condiments left little impression and our linen was stained. The service itself was very plain and none of our items came out on a tier. Even the bone China was plain and simple. I was expecting the Ritz to have paid more attention to details such as fine China clean linens and a beautiful presentation. The waitress also never took our used silverware. We had to use the same silverware for our sandwiches on our desserts. They also did not have actual tea spoons which I thought was a bad oversight on the hotels part. it is a small detail but a very telling one when you can not even provide proper silverware. We were honestly more impressed with the actual hotel the building not the service. Not a memorable experience and honestly not worth the 50. If you are looking for a proper tea service I would recommend driving to Covington to the English Tea room and Eatery. Not impressed at all. Vastly disappointed with the entire thing.

The sugar plum tea was exceptional. The first course was bite sizes canap\u00e9s with no tea sandwiches. The chicken salad curry cup and the cucumber dill were my favorites. The presentation is not like your traditional tea party with the items on a tiered tray. All the items come on one plate. The first course is a bit lackluster all the canap\u00e9s are crowded on the plate. If they presented the first course how they did the dessert course I think it would be a lot better. The next course were the vanilla and a cranberry scone. They were small but good. I expected them to be bigger. The last course was the mini desserts all very pretty with different flavors. The tea at the Ritz was my favorite part of our whole trip. It also has the best parking rate round. 21 to park ca n\u2019t beat that price.

We had a pretty rough time at the New Orleans Ritz Carlton. We spent our first day at Mariot \u2019s Saint Hotel followed by 3 night \u2019s next door at the Ritz Carlton. I wanted to surprise my wife with the Ritz but wish I just stayed at the Saint next door. This New Orleans Ritz is nothing like the ones I \u2019ve stayed at before in Philadelphia and New York. It was in really rough shape. The basement pool and hot tub were not well cared for. The wood by the hot tub was rotted out. The hot tub tiles were gross with mold mildew. The wicker towel holder was old and worn. I was surprised that half the time there was no doorman. It \u2019s a rough neighborhood and I had envisioned the Ritz as a quick escape from the craziness of Bourbon Street. At Mariot \u2019s Saint next door there was always a doorman security watching the front door. At the Ritz half the time anyone could walk in. However I \u2019m saving the best for last. On our last night they performed the turn down service and left our room door open. When we arrived at our room we were freaking out checking for people behind the curtains and making sure none of our electronics or other valuables were taken. When we called to tell the front desk there was complete indifference. For the price you pay for the Ritz you expect more. You expect it to be the best hotel around. However Mariot \u2019s Saint next door was a much better experience for half the price. The JW Mariot across the street and the other Mariot a couple of blocks down also look like great options. When we got home this evening I had a new charge on my credit card from the Ritz. Apparently with no communication at all they decided to charge my credit card for an orange juice from the room.
