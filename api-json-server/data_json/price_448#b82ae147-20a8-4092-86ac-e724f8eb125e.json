Great stay. Kids and I went for mini vacation of 4 nights and everything was wonderful. Polite and efficient staff. Room was spotless. Love the pool overlooking the bay. Music playing by the pool made for a great atmosphere. Really good food at the restaurant. Nice to get take out and eat by the pool while you watch the boats.

This is a motel style hotel that is somewhat dated. However despite the room needing a makeover it was clean and comfortable. Hotel is well located and free parking is a bonus.

Our room was in another building no porterage offered. We had to pay for the room straight away no problem but they charged extra 100 in case we smoke in the room or bring pets.

A bird stole a piece of my bun as soon as the plate was set on the table and the brought me another burger without any charge. The breakfast is very complete it has cereal yogurt pancakes eggs fruits etc. The rooms were big and very clean. We stayed only two nights but we rented three rooms and were a total of 11 people.

Spent lots of time reading reviews and agonizing over where to stay as a first timer in Miami. did not want the craziness of SoBe and needed parking for our rental car. We wanted to be within walking distance to Collins and Lincoln or so we thought. After realizing that we had have to pay a fortune to park our rental car and pay high room fees we decided to look further out and found the Best Western. Good rates and 10 parking. The hotel is trying to update and they have done a good job in the lobby. Staff were friendly and helpful. The room was sort of updated carpet tile fixtures etc. The beds were only full size and semi comfortable. AC blasted loudly all night. Which probably kept us from hearing any outside noise so that was actually ok. there is a restaurant in the hotel on the water side. it is called Shuckers. I will review it separately but I can tell you not to waste your time and money. Use the free drink coupons from the hotel you get two for each day and GTFOT. The hotel is on the bay which is really cool and makes it centrally located. Uber was 15 down to SoBe. We drove to Mid Beach one morning. it is around 36th street and scored on street parking. Just have to get there early which in Miami is anytime before 1030am lol. We used the pool overlooking the bay. It was great. Just turned the sun chairs around and enjoyed the view of the bay.

Entrance of the hotel is nice and modern and i had high hopes for the rooms also. Unfortunately it did not live up to expectation room was clean but very tired. Balcony door was a nightmare to open and close and very little day light opposite a high rise building. Staff were very warm and friendly on arrival however they did not want to answer any further questions beyond that first interaction. A deposit was taken from the card i held the room on AND my card i presented at check in. At no point was i advised of the double charge or else i would have remained with the original. When i asked reception why they requested the money twice i got very vague answers and a stroppy attitude. Needless to say calling my bank to release the funds back to me was the last thing i wanted to be doing on holiday and after a 10 hour flight. Location is OK basically thank god for uber pool. This saved us substantially on taxi costs to the touristy areas of the city. Time to places like bayside is roughly 20 30 mins.
