I was going to let this slide and chalk it up to the property being older but on the morning I checked out when I was in the shower one of the ceiling panels fell down exposing the plumbing above it. If i was taller it could have hit me in the head. Mentioned all this when I checked out staff was apologetic and comped a night as well as bonus starpoints but the hotel lacks even general maintenance. When I said that all of this was easily fixable the response was well the building is an old property. That should not matter. Unles there is a complete overhaul I probably will not be staying here again. Will check out the Westin or Le Meridien.

Also I think I just got unlucky at the front desk. I had the taciturn Briana. I checked in and she just handed me my hotel keycards without telling me anything about my requests or the hotel or even like a Welcome to the hotel.
