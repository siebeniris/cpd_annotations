Friendly staff nice pool and facilities rooms in good condition and well appointed. Stayed in the Tamarisk Bldg. on the second floor this time and found the noise from the road very distracting and it interrupted our sleep several times. The location is quite central but you need to have a car as nothing is within walking distance. Would stay again only if we could stay in another building. Central location nice pool and other facilities. Rooms have been renovated and are perfect for up to 4 people. The noise from nearby Cathedral Canyon Dr is loud day and night. Need to plant trees or something to block the noise or upgrade the windows. If you have a car the location is good.

We chose this place for it is central location as we were visiting elderly relatives in Banning and Palm Desert. Although not ultra modern in this spacious two room suite everything was functioning bed was very comfortable and we were on the upper floor only two levels high. The spacious south facing balcony overlooked the golf course and the mountains and had sun virtually all day and hardly any noise from the surroundings. The grounds were well maintained and the two pools were of a good size and reasonably warm. There is a snack bar bar by the polside lounging area. Sun loungers are good quality and free towels are issued from the games room which also has pool tables and table tennis. The reception area is very welcoming and there is free coffee in the foyer in the mornings. All the staff were very helpful and cheery. I played a few rounds of golf on the adjacent course which was in reasonably good condition considering the time of year. I was on a few occasions scooping small roaches up and throwing them outside it is a hot climate and the room is not hermetically sealed you can not prevent this at all times we take the conditions as they come.

From the cheesy pool cafe to the neglected activity center the cockroach we found in the room. I really think they should have a nice sit down restaurant instead of ordering from the pool cafe and taking it to go or having to eat outside in 115 \u00b0. I signed up for an activity only to be informed that it was canceled because they did not have staff that had been trained working that day. Another activity they were not the least bit ready for was the making a succulent garden. I chose 3 plants out of the 9 available luckily the other people decided not to do it but they only had 6 plants to choose from. We attended the Welk resort owner meeting where they show you all the good things you would get from becoming an owner. luckily we had no intention since they scheduled that meeting early the furst day before we were totally disappointed wuth the resort.

There were probably only 20 chairs that are polside. I recommend they add more water stations. I recommend fresh fruit inside the water coolers. I recommend they offer cream or real half and half at the coffee station in the lobby. I recommended they play more music at the pool it was quiet for a day or two.

We also found an earwig in our bed.
