This was a short staycation3 nights on a promotional package. Property is reasonably close to Atlanta although likely a 70 90 minute ride from ATL and hosts a lot of weddings and corporate affairs. All staff were very friendly and helpful. Room is what you would expect from an upscale property although wifi was slow unles you paid for the upgrade. Hotel restaurants are nothing special but the food at the winery. ooh la la fair warning prepare to pay we were quite happy. Pool area is very nice and salt water although the food at the pool is pretty limited. The winery tour came with the package was pretty straightforward it is a winery. Some of the wines are quite good because the grapes are imported from CA. The local wines are muscadine based and are surprisingly good if you like sweet. The Spa was disappointing perhaps because it was heavily booked by a wedding party. There are two affiliated golf courses. The Chateau course was in such bad shape that it was closed perhaps for a year according to the pro shop sadly after I had already played. The Woodlands course is in so so condition for a resort course but ok condition for a GA public course that gets a lot of traffic which is what it really is. Beware thick rough blind shots and considerable local knowledge required but still a fun round. Must have been because I did go back the next day. If you are trying to save money on food there are options close by off property but you will need a car.

I am here for a wedding which was lovely and for the price point the rooms are esteticaly appeasing but not functional for the average female guest staying here. The lighting in the bathroom sucks for applying makeup not to mention the mirror is set back way too far so I had to lean in to apply my wedding makeup there was no additional mirror to use and doing so cause me to bruise the front of my thighs on the counter top of the bathroom sink. The one full length mirror in the room while nice is smoky so one can not get a good vision of how they look. The food is a grade below average in my opinion they only have 24 hr room service on the weekends there is no complimentary water in the rooms but all the vending machines was out of water I do not drink soda. therefore I remained thirsty for a long while and I could not take my meds in the morning. My room did not have hot water so they had moved me to another room in which the TV was smaller and something was off about the bed. Because I had to wait for them to either fix my hot water situation or change my room I missed breakfast and had to wait for an hour or find another place to go eat I am a diabetic so missing meals in not acceptable. At the wedding reception the the food was subpar and the silverware on the tables were dirty. I AM TRULY OVER THIS PLACE. though I have one more days stay however I am ready to cut my losses and jump ship. OH did I mention that the shower has only one small soap dish so it is virtually impossible to take shampoo conditioner a razor or the likes in it with you because there is no place to put those things until you need them. To sum this up I have stayed at far nicer places and I am not inclined to recommend the Chateau Elan as a nice place to stay at least not at their price point. sincerelydisapointedguest cantwaitoleave.", "offset": [40, 201], "date": "2016-11-05", "cpt": "0", "category": "price"}, {"id": 6, "uid": "07b64894-35c3-43ed-8e36-8e72fdfecec4", "sentence": "Nice wine tasting but the Cafe s new menu is unimpressive.

I really did want to love this place but the quality versus cost does not meet expectations. The property itself is very beautiful and the hotel and winery are set up really well and also beautiful. However the costs of things are WAY higher than they should be. Example one the wine tasting is 20 per person for 6 tastings. I knew this in advance but reviews I read said the tastings were generous. They are not. They use the shot stoppers on the wine bottles so each tasting is literally measured to like 2 oz or something. I have been to SO many other wineries and never have I seen this or paid 20 for six measly tastings. Example two. The rooms. They are nicely appointed and recently renovated however they are not worth 300 a night by far. Maybe 200 a night. However my biggest complaint the hot water in the shower. what hot water. Its BARELY lukewarm. I thought something was wrong with the hot water heater until my husband pointed out that the shower fixture is the same one we have at home. and you could not move the lever past halfway like we do at home for the hot water. They must have put a stopper partway to the hot side which prevents you from making the water hotter. so they are cheap and do not offer hotter water than lukewarm. I did not bother complaining as we did not have time in the morning to switch rooms to see if it was any hotter. But when I pay 300 a night for a room I expect a nice hot shower. Example 3. The food. All the food we had was over priced. The cheese plate we ordered at the lounge for 16 was listed as a selection of cheeses honeycomb honey and crostini. What we got was tiny amounts of three types of cheese a smear of honeycomb and those cheap water crackers. never again. How does costini water crackers. The breakfast was even worst. At 20 per person I was expecting a true brunch. What I got was the same powerded eggs Light and fit yogurt and cheap biscuits with gravy that is served at the local Holiday inn for free. The made to order omelets were the only saving grace. So I am really sad that Chateau Elan did not meet my expectations. We are not high end people and this was a splurge for us so I was shocked at what we got for 300 a night. I am not sure we will ever return even though the customer service is fantastic our servers were great and check in and check out was a breeze. Parking is free which is nice and the wine is really really great in flavor and variety. We loved the Irish pub onsite and the grounds were nice for a stroll in the morning and the pool area is beautiful for when its warmer. The whole place is set up for quick weekend getaways and overnights which is what we were doing. I was hoping we could go back but we only will if they start providing much discounted rooms and packages.

I realize that this is a very upscale resort and was actually okay with that. but was absolutely shocked when they charged us an additional 8 for two glasses of orange juice. I would think that a 40 breakfast buffet would at the very least include two glasses of OJ.

The chateau is absolutely beautiful from the inn to the pool to the winery to the spa. The biggest and truly only complaint I have is that the amenities listed on the website are NOT consistent with the hours they are actually open. We came Monday Thursday and the website AND the brochure in the room itself both had pool hours and restaurant hours listed incorrectly. They stated Fleur de Lis was open for breakfast daily but it only actually has breakfast on weekends. The spa itself was also hard to find without asking for directions. The pool bar was listed as opening at 11 daily but really opens at noon throughout the week. It would also be nice if the winery was open later than 7 pm. The gift shop was unable to break a 20 bill which was also slightly inconvenient and the treadmills and elliptical machines almost all had tv screens that were not functional which was disappointing. The pool was lovely and spacious with plenty of comfortable chairs and umbrellas but the waterfall advertised by the website that allegedly pours into the hot tub was not running at all. The pool bar staff was awesome Crystal gets five stars hands down. Dinner at Marc was unexpectedly awesome particularly the Brussels sprouts and the charcuterie board that was far superior to the one offered next door in the winery. Robert our server was super friendly and knowledgeable and took plenty of time explaining the dinner features to us and making us feel welcome and special. We got tremendous enjoyment from the after dinner house made caramels with duck fat. Absolutely mouth watering. The lemon pepper wings and the snake bite drink at Paddys were both excellent and the price was right for the pub fare. The room was very clean and well appointed and the beds were extremely comfortable as well. From a cost standpoint the room rate was totally reasonable the spa services seemed overpriced as well as the majority of the food and drinks but that is to be expected at a nice resort hotel. Yoga for 15 at the spa was really enjoyable and the tennis court hourly rate of 25 seemed reasonable as well. The staff went out of their way to make sure we had everything we needed and overall we really enjoyed our stay and would recommend the chateau to friends looking for a quiet or romantic getaway particularly with a unique winery twist.", "offset": [1663, 1782], "date": "2017-07-27", "cpt": "0", "category": "price"}, {"id": 10, "uid": "1b9cb391-ed04-4edb-b74f-3a16eb85d937", "sentence": "Very nice property but over rated expected more especially when it came to the room but all in nice.
