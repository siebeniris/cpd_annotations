I always wanted to stay in Raffles Hotel because of the history and my fondness of old colonial buildings. I arrived just after 3 pm and expected to be able to check in my room. However the room was not ready and staff offered me a complimentary meal in their Italian restaurant. However I had already eaten on my flight and was not hungry. Instead I suggested they offer to buy me Singapore Sling in The Long Bar. My room was ready in about an hour and I was picked up by the same staff and shown to my room. The member of staff was polite and courteous I think her name was JoevieI stayed in Somerset Maugham suite on the ground floor. The suite has high ceilings and separated in 3 distinct areas dining living room bedroom and bathroom. The room decor and furniture is immaculate and clean. I really enjoyed the room and seeing historical pictures documents of Somerset Maugham even though I did not know who he was. A couple of minor complaints about the room. At night I could clearly hear floor boards creaking and people walking in the room above me. Also the hot water in the bathroom was not very hot. I do enjoy a steaming hot bath and the water was lukewarm at bestIf you do get the chance I encourage you to explore the hotel. I wondered around and stumbled across a room with photographs documents of old showing for eg the barman creator of Singapore Sling Noel Coward and QEI staying in the hotel. Also above the reception which is out of bounds to the general public is worth visiting. Here you can sit down take in Raffles and admire the history and decor. I think I must have spent half a day wondering aroundLocation wise Raffles is more towards CBD near City Hall or Esplanade MRT. By City Hall is a large shopping complex called Raffles City I think. City Hall is only a few stops away from the famous shopping area Orchard Road. Raffles is near the waterfront and walkable to Merlion and Esplanade TheatresAs for the hotel itself I would say Raffles is more than what I imagined it to be.

From the minute we arrived there was none of the usual hustle and bustle of check in queues we were ushered away to the residents only lounge where we were given Singapore Slings or whatever else we wished while the staff dealt with our check in. We were then taken to our beautiful suite. We had a Palm Court Suite which was glorious. The decor was fitting with a wonderful colonial hotel and I do not agree with reviewers who say it needs an update modern decor would just not work. There was lots of room for all of us it was impeccably clean and housekeeping did a wonderful job twice a day especially the lovely touch at turn down including an extract from one of the famous authors from the time. We were supplied with unlimited bottles of water decent nespreso coffee machine where pods were constantly refilled decent tea and a cupboard full of glasses cups mugs and a tea pot. Singapore is a very noisy busy city so it was wonderful to come back to Raffles and we immediately felt relaxed. We ate in the Long Bar and the Courtyard Cafe. yes it was expensive but so is the rest of Singapore and the quality and friendliness of the staff at Raffles is worth it. We also had breakfast in the Tiffin Room which was superb with everything we could possibly wish for to eat. The pool was just wonderful and Melvin looked after us so so well anticipating our every need. It was never packed and we were always found loungers immediately given fresh towels and lovely cold bottles of water.

I stayed in the hotel from Feb 4 to Feb9 with my family included a kid of more than 4 years old for celebrating my 9 years wedding anniversary. Every one of the hotel is very nice. At the first time when you stepped out from the taxi you were just began treated as the distinguished guest. The Indian door man would let you sit in the lobby you just need to provide your passport then everything would be done. As the area of origin for the famous Singapore Sling it now has become the welcome drink of this hotel. Everybody who stays in the hotel can try Singapore Sling during the time of Check in. But of course the kid will get a cup of orange juice as welcome drink. After the check in our butler led our way to our suite. Our suite was on the ground floor with garden view just nearing the gift shop of the hotel. Raffles Hotel opened in 187 it was named after Sir Stamford Raffles who was also the founder of modern Singapore. The suites of Raffles now still keeps the British Colonial style the shutter windows in the sitting room golden brass taps of the bath room everything of the room reminds me Raffles is the hotel of 19th century of the word. The suite of Raffles used Fragonard as toilet requisites because I traveled with my daughter. one set of kid \u2019s organic toilet requisites GAIA were also ready in my suite. The brand of tea bags in the Raffles suites is also my favorite brand Ronefeldt. It was a really enjoyable feeling that every morning you could have a cup of tea you like. As the landmark of Singapore Raffles hotel now is also opened to the public as a scenic spot. But it \u2019s just one part of the hotel. Many areas are just opened to the residents only for protecting the privacy of residents of the hotel. I enjoyed my stay very well not disturbing by the tourist at all. It \u2019s a pity that the hotel museum was closed during the time of my stay. I only visited the corridor of 2nd floor which exhibits a lot of photos for the notable persons who stayed in this hotel before including Queen Elizabeth II former US president George Bush and Bill Clinton etc. This area is opened to the residents only it makes me know a lot histories for this remarkable hotel. Besides the hardware service is always noticed as the heart of the hotel which can be called luxury hotel. Raffles Singapore keeps traditional costumed Indian as the doorman. I noticed that there were two elder Indians my daughter called them kind \u201c grandpa \u201d every morning they chatted with my little daughter and said Hi Five with her although my daughter could only speak a little English but she really likes these two \u201c grandpas \u201d from heart. At the first time when you stepped into the suite I noticed the welcome letter written by General Manager on the table it made the residents felt so warm. The butler service was also good if you had any question your butler would always help you in time. Housekeeping always finished job at the right time. This time I travelled with my daughter of 4 years old every afternoon we came back to the hotel for her nap and then went out for dinner again. Every time we came back to the hotel our suite was always cleaned so well and on the table everyday fresh fruits would be sent in the evening a little story of Raffles paper would be put on the night table although I never met the housekeeper during my stay. As I mentioned before every body of the hotel was so nice my husband and me once missed the way in the hotel for going to Long Bar I met three workers and then asked the way although I heard they were discussing something about work one of the man during them who looks like a manager still led us the way personally to Long Bar and arranged the seats for us. At the swimming pool the workers would help you set the towels on the reclining chair at the first time. My husband and me have several travelling experiences in several Luxury Hotels around the world but my husband said the service of Raffles Singapore was really the best we have ever met. This time because travelling with our kid we just tried Tiffin for breakfast and Long Bar Tiffin offers traditional English breakfast very well but it was a pity that at the last day my husband would like to try Japanese breakfast set and got the reply that it had been cleared out. Except this every thing was excellent. I believe that if next time I come back to Singapore we still would stay in Raffles Singapore Raffles left our family all good memories during our travelling time in Singapore my little daughter now still talks again and again that she likes this hotel very wel\u83b1\u4f5b\u58eb\u9152\u5e97\u7559\u7ed9\u4e86\u6211\u548c\u5bb6\u4eba\u60ca\u8273\u7684\u5165\u4f4f\u4f53\u9a8c\uff0c\u65e0\u8bba\u4ece\u786c\u4ef6\u548c\u9152\u5e97\u5386\u53f2\u80cc\u666f\uff0c\u9152\u5e97\u670d\u52a1\u8d28\u91cf\u6765\u8bf4\uff0c\u90fd\u662f\u5f53\u4e4b\u65e0\u6127\u7684\u65b0\u52a0\u5761\u56fd\u5b9d\u7ea7\u9152\u5e97\uff0c\u4e5f\u662f\u65b0\u52a0\u5761\u72ec\u4e00\u65e0\u4e8c\u7684\u6587\u5316\u9057\u4ea7\uff0c\u4e0b\u6b21\u518d\u53bb\u65b0\u52a0\u5761\u6211\u548c\u6211\u7684\u5bb6\u4eba\u4ecd\u7136\u4f1a\u518d\u6b21\u5165\u4f4f\u83b1\u4f5b\u58eb\u3002\u4e9a\u6d32\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e16\u754c\u7b2c\u516b\u7684\u6392\u540d\u4e0d\u662f\u5f92\u6709\u5176\u540d \uff01.", "offset": [988, 1211], "date": "2017-02-20 00:00:00", "cpt": "1", "category": "room"}, {"id": 11, "uid": "7d851b1b-d39d-4323-98f0-61da8450fb58", "sentence": "Welcome Home.

A four night stay in a State Suite in what is lauded as Singapores iconic luxury historic colonial hotel with a price to match was unfortunately far from what the marketing hype would have one believe.

It all felt like the luxury Raffles name has been cheapened by Acor down to something akin to an MGalery Collection hotel. Service experienced was very mixed starting with my travel agent Virtuoso and myself sending independent email inquiries regarding my confirmed reservation only to receive the automatic acknowledgement email but no following email answer.

After some time waiting with nothing happening I got up and wandered about the lobby until a butler finally came up to check me in only to be rudely interrupted by a hotel visitor with the result the butler switched her complete attention to the rude hotel visitor and wandered off with them showing directions leaving me abandoned on the lobby floor.

Arrangements were made for a butler to arrange a viewing of a Studio Suite the next day but this never happened. A couple of days later I requested at reception for an inspection but was told all were occupied a lie to fob me off as it turned out. and that the hotel was no longer selling Studio Suites and I would not be able to inspect one. Why then are they still being advertised on the Raffles Hotel website. Later that morning my butler showed me a serviced unoccupied Studio Suite. Do not train your reception staff to lie to in resident guests to fob them off it leaves a very sour impresionCheck out experience was worse than check in. Despite all confirmed for a butler to attend my suite from 130pm to check out for an arranged limousine transfer at 145pm I waited until 140pm with no contact from any staff. I phoned to ascertain what is going on and a butler said he had come to my suite. Sick of waiting yet again I commenced carrying my luggage to reception only to meet a butler half way who ushered me down only to be sat down in the public part of the main lobby and wait and wait again for a sheet of paper to be printed. Check out was finally completed a bit before 20pm. Fortunately the limousine was on standby and I was not in a mad rush to catch my flightSuch a shame as excellent service was also experienced. Special mention must be made of butler Claren who was very polished and professional with service provided. Ryan at the Tiffin Room could have been in any number of three star restaurants perfect professional service to be highly commended. I used room service once which was promptly and professionally delivered. Butler Jeremy was efficient at delivering fresh milk for coffee in suite it must be the first hotel I have stayed in where no milk or creamer is provided in room of course preferable would be on call tea or coffee served by butler as used to be the case in Raffles and is still done at The Strand Hotel Rangoon for example. The restoration architects are to be applauded and commended for the magnificent restoration of the Raffles Hotel building beautifully accomplished. Modern technology airconditioning and lighting have been cleverly and seamlesly integrated into the historic suites and bathrooms pleasingly remodeled. Double glazing and soundproofing provide for a generally quiet retreat although the traffic noise can still be heard in the State Suites overlooking Bras Basah Road and thudding footsteps of those in the suite above can still be heard below. Marble and teak walkways gardens and courtyards have all been beautifully restored. However those in charge of interior decoration ought be sentenced to several dozen strokes for the unforgivable destruction of the grande dames elegant colonial soul. Colonial cane furniture on the front portico replaced with dull modern furniture of a style one would expect to find in an Ibis a somewhat gaudy platinum coloured main lobby chandelier clashes badly with the elegant colonial styled brass coloured chandeliers elsewhere in the lobby the beautiful antique persian carpet in the main lobby replaced with a bland modern abstract patterned rug the same completely out of character mass produced contemporary artworks hang in every suite and abstract patterned carpets in the suites instead of persian carpets etcThe elegant colonial Raffles Grill has been replaced with a modern bistro at fine dining prices complete with gaudy laser cut light fitting and with some tables so close you could bump elbows with neigbouring diners. The Tiffin Room has been guted and replaced with an ambiance more akin to an upmarket food court stripped of crisp white table clothes and with tables so small the waiters have difficulty juggling tableware around to fit plates on the table. The elegant haven of the Writers Bar is now a darkly decorated room which feels like ones in some modern Italian basement bar. The final straw would have to be the graffiti street art murals on the gleaming colonial white interior walls of the first and second floors of the main building completely and utterly absurdThe elegant Raffles Hotel monogram cutlery and silverware is retained however a big tick for getting that right. Elegant bedside lamps remain in the suites and there is a comfortable leather upholstered chair. but then a modern styled table and bland gray sofa with thin armrests which looks like it is from a cheap Novotel hotel. Acor are misleading guests by claiming the hotel fully reopened on 1 August. The Bar Billiard Room was still not open and scraping down and repainting of the front wall of the hotel was still taking place at the time of my stay. Scraping painting and use of strong smelling epoxy glue was evident in various locales about the hotel. It all felt like the hotel was very much still in pre opening soft opening mode. The in suite iPad management system is an excellent idea and worked well for operating lights curtains etc except that the night and day curtain buttons are the wrong way round as are the high to low fan speeds for the airconditioning check for yourself Mr Westbeld State Suite 265. The latter resulted in me having a somewhat noisy uncomfortable suite with roaring fan noise and blasting air in the parlour on what was supposedly low fan speed until I discovered the fan speeds had been incorrectly programmed. I used the iPad command to have a butler call me or attend to my suite a couple of times but gave up waiting only to discover it is much quicker to dial 2 on the telephone and speak to a butler directly. if the call does not ring out with no answer as it did on a couple of ocasionsThe Raffles Spa facilities are excellent with helpful staff the sento provides a wonderfully relaxing soak and there are saunas and steam rooms. Pity the ice machine never worked for the whole five days of my stay. Breakfast was excellent in the Tiffin Room apart from the lost colonial ambiance with what may well be the best pastries in all of Asia. Service in the Tiffin Room was excellent particularly from Ryan as previously mentioned. If you are merely seeking a plush modern hotel experience in the shell of an historic building then you might give Raffles a pass subject to service levels experienced. If however you are seeking that unique special elegant colonial Raffles experience that modern hotels do not offer forget it you are too late.", "offset": [3192, 3515], "date": "2019-08-28 08:08:57", "cpt": "2", "category": "room"}, {"id": 22, "uid": "01e2cf1d-4edb-42f4-80c5-fa1a028c332c", "sentence": "very soothing environment.

We stayed at the recently reopened Raffle in mid September 2019. This was an irresistible opportunity to see the huge renovation and the first since 198. The hotel is stunning being both modern and extremely rooted in its history at the same time. It rightly belongs in the pantheon of legendary great hotels but you can tell there are some early teething problems. Those problems hit immediately when we arrived. We got to Raffles at 130 am after a very long couple of flights from Toronto. There was no one at the door and we had carry our bags up the steps and through the lobby. Weirdly there is no ramp at the entrance which seemed odd given the renovation. Hiccup number two was the 15 minutes it took to check us in. This was clearly an issue with their computer system since there was n\u2019t anyone else competing for the staff \u2019s attention at that hour. Once that was dealt with the real Raffles emerged. Every room is served by a group of butlers and one of them appeared to deliver us to our room. Every room is actually configured as a suite with a bedroom and separate sitting room. The rooms are beautiful in a a fairly monochromatic way. The floors and furniture are dark wood and the walls are a warm white The bathroom is clad entirely in carara marble with a lot of nicely milled detailed. This was an expensive renovation. Pretty much everything in the suite can be controlled by two iPads one in the bedroom and the other in the sitting room. In a nod to tradition and practicality some functions can also be controlled using updated knob and tube style brass switches. These switches add a real century old charm to the room. We had breakfast in the Tiffin Room. The restaurant had a wide ranging buffet with everything from cereals to some pretty luxurious charcuterie. There are even salmon caviar and blinis with the usually accompaniments. There is a large variety of breads and pastries which are surprisingly good given challenges of the heat and humidity. The \u00e0 la carte menu has western Chinese Japanese and Indian breakfasts making it a great palate expanding opportunity. We had high tea in the lobby. It has the typical selections of savouries and sweets and a truly comprehensive selection of teas. If you have come all this way it is worth braving the crowds and cost to have a drink at the Long Bar. It is the home of the Singapore Sling and their version is definitely superior to the vast majority of imitations. The outdoor pool is wonderful especially in the heat of the equatorial afternoon. The water is salt water chlorinated. The pleasant surprise is the almost Atlantic level salinity. It makes the swimmers exceptionally floaty. The bartender comes around with water and the occasional pleasant treat. An especially memorable one was an edible rubber duck in coconut jelly. Back to foibles for a bit. Every day the staff brought sweets of some kind. Weirdly the uneaten portion was removed at the turndown service. This was very odd and quite disappointing if you \u2019re expecting to come back to the room for a snack. An overall observation was that the staff took a long time to get to know the guests. This is an expectation at this level of hotel especially in one with just over 100 rooms. Somehow some communication was not happening that I expect normally would have. On our last day I got to sit down with a member of the management team to discuss the issues we had encountered. The hotel is everything we expected it to be there were just some service issues that were missing for a hotel in the top echelons. She was interested in hearing our concerns and I have every reason to belief that Raffle \u2019s management will address them. If Marina Bay Sands is the new Vegas y face of Singapore Raffle \u2019s the the traditional and refined yet updated face.", "offset": [1186, 1340], "date": "2019-10-01 00:00:00", "cpt": "2", "category": "room"}, {"id": 25, "uid": "a0646760-6385-4adf-a28d-e308f458b4ce", "sentence": "Amazing historic hotel needs some fine tuning. We stayed here with my elderly mother in November and had booked 2 Personality suites requested John Wayne for my mother for 2 nights. We were warmly welcomed on arrival and shown to our suites by our Butler. The rooms have been recently renovated and were very luxurious. Unfortunately the air con in John Wayne was broken and could not be fixed. As there were no other Personality suites available we both chose to change rooms and downgrade to a lower room category the Front desk Manager offered us some small financial compensation each to cover the difference. The room sizes and design were identical however a glass must have been broken in our new suite and not properly cleared up as I stepped on broken glass and cut my foot. The rooms suites themselves are very well appointed and very quiet. We could not hear any external noise at all. However my elderly mother really struggled with the new iPad which controlled the lighting the curtains the air con and the TV. The lights etc had manual switches which helped but she could not manage the tv controls at all and it would have been nice to have a traditional remote control as well. We contacted our Butler to arrange to have our complimentary Singapore Slings at a table in the Long Bar but after an hour of calling him he never came back to us so we asked for them to be delivered to our suite. We also asked to have a table booked at the Bar and Billiard Room restaurant for that evening at 7 pm which he called back and confirmed. Our drinks arrived and were delicious. However when we arrived at the restaurant they had no record of our reservation and all the tables were fully booked. They could have sat us at the high bench surrounding the kitchen but we would have been sat on high stools which my mother could not manage. The Restaurant Manager was fantastic and after a short wait he managed to place us at a table that had just been vacated. We had an amazing meal. The breakfast was good quality and plenty of it. We had to leave at 6 am on our last day and a picnic breakfast was delivered to us. it was huge and really good. We chose to wheel our own cases to reception to check out but could not get into the main lobby as all the doors had been locked and no one heard us knock my husband managed to get around to the front door and the night porter helped us with our bags to our awaiting driver. We checked out without incident. I have yet to check my credit card to confirm we were paid the room change compensation. It was wonderful to stay here and it is a beautiful grand hotel.

I rarely put reviews on tripadvisor because hotels typically send surveys to guests. My husband and I stayed at the Raffles Singapore in February and clearly a guest survey is not part of their MO. The hotel has done an excellent job in their renovation refurbishment. It has all the modern features but has retained its colonial charm. We booked one of the personality suites and the room was nothing short of spectacular but still has its flaws. The chest drawer fridge was leaking and not closing properly so all frosted up. The water bottles that are available for guests were n\u2019t stored in the fridge both still sparkling. So unles you want to drink them at room temperature you have to always ask the butler for some ice everyday. Ice bucket everyday being refilled twice a day upon request would have been easier. The dressing table with pop up mirror with the hairdryer inside was too low. Or maybe they just need to tilt up the mirror angle so it \u2019s the right reflection instead of looking at your neck while sitting you can actually see your hair. The Ipad control was really hi tech but honestly we prefer the old fashioned light switch and remote control. The staff over promoted it like it \u2019s the best room feature but was n\u2019t really that impressed as it is more of a pain to operate. It \u2019s not difficult it \u2019s just inconvenient. We spent most of our time at the hotel during the whole 3 days we were there. Only went out to dinner once as the La Dame De Pic was closed on our last evening. Breakfast on Day 1. the yogurt from the fridge was past its use by date. They got removed from the cabinet when I pointed it out to the staff. Lack of attention to detail obviously from the kitchen staff who put the yogurt in the fridge. Lunch at the pool was very pleasant. We had lunch there twice and pre dinner drinks once. Drinks at the The Long Bar was very enjoyable as the butler has made a reservation for us so we did n\u2019t have to stand in the queue. Dinner at the Butcher \u2019s Block was very good and the staff were very attentive and engaging. Lunch at the BR on Sunday was also very good as far as service and some of the food quality. Only disappointment was the shrimp dish that my husband ordered. They were serious when they called them shrimp because they were so small. Hardly any meat. The biggest disappointment for us was during check out. We were given a late check out as we had a late flight. We checked out early it was arranged that our bags were to be picked up at 530PM from the suite to be loaded into the car booked by 6PM to the airport. There was clearly a disconnect in the communication between front office and the concierge. Our bags were n\u2019t picked up from the suite on the arranged time. As we have been sitting in the lobby we asked the concierge on duty she said the car has been there all along waiting for us. but without our bags. I imagine it was also the concierge \u2019s duty to organise someone to go to the suite to pick up the bags and load them into the car at 530PM as arranged by front office. We were n\u2019t late for our flight we had plenty of time but the attitude of the concierge was unfortunately left a bad impression for us after a lovely 3day stay.", "offset": [541, 640], "date": "2020-03-15 00:00:00", "cpt": "2", "category": "room"}, {"id": 29, "uid": "9e0714c9-90c7-4fd6-911e-1808718106fc", "sentence": "Excellent Accommodation. My wife and I stayed for 2 nights in early March. We had planned to stay the next time we had a stopover in Singapore. We had just completed a luxury 3 week tour of India and were returning home. We were met during the evening at Changi International Airport Waiting Area by a Raffles representative and escorted with our cases to their white Mercedes S Class Limousine. On arrival at the hotel we were welcomed by name to check in at the reception lobby. We were upgraded to the Gavin Young Personality Suite for our stay. Our leather entry cards did not have a number just the name of the suite. Check in staff accompanied us to our room and explained how to operate the i pad and services available in the room. Our bags were in the room when we arrived. These processes are the sign of a grand hotel. Wifi and breakfast and a US food credit was also made available to us. Our Room Butler arrived soon after and explained that she was available to assist us in our stay. We stayed at the Palm Court Wing which has a combined walkway verandah outside each room. This is not private but a wide shared walkway that any guests can use to walk around the hotel. On an exploratory walk around our wing we encountered a couple sitting in their chairs deep in conversation and they gave us a nasty stare as we walked past. Our suite consisted of a parlor a bedroom and a bathroom. The parlor and the bedroom had their own i pad controls. All rooms could be controlled on either of the i pads. Air conditioning power curtains lights TV night lights are all controlled on the i pads that are lodged in chargers when they are not in use. They were easy to use and did not worry us older Australians. I felt that the comfortable firm bed seemed an odd shape where you needed to climb up high in it to stop you rolling out. Like a brand new bed that has not been broken in yet. The two sinks were useful and centrally located bath was easy to use. The bathroom facilities were pure luxury. A large wardrobe incorporating the TV took up a full wall of the bedroom. A really nice room. The parlor was small and had an interesting trunk style cabinet with a minibar cutlery and tea and coffee making facilities all enclosed. Comfy chairs and a TV completed the decor. We ate a sumptuous breakfast in the Tiffin Room where hot food can be ordered from the menu. The food on the buffet was exquisitely presented and proved to be delicious though there was no place to put your plate down while you were holding the lid and a spoon or lifters to serve yourself. Staff in the Tiffin Room were warm friendly and helpful and always knew our names and preferences. I like to drink a cup of Marsala Chai Tea with breakfast and it was expertly made for me each day. I really would have liked to stay a few more days just for that. We spent our afternoon at the swimming pool located on the roof expertly looked after by Alex. As the light failed we decided to return to the room and get ready for dinner. We decided to eat at BR by Alain Ducase Italian Restaurant at the hotel and sent a message using the i pad to the butler to obtain a table for us. Our butler did not respond and after 10 minutes or so we walked down to the lobby on our way to the Raffles Shopping Boutique and asked the Concierge to book a table for us. After our shopping where we bought items for ourselves and our friends we walked directly to the restaurant where we were greeted by name and shown to our table. Staff were again warm friendly and helpful especially giving us advice about size and contents of the meals. With the assistance of the Sommelier I ordered a glass of the Raffles Anniversary Bilecart Salmon Champagne which was a great choice. We had a lovely seafood meal and dessert and had a great meal and service there. We went back to our room and repacked our cases for the next morning departure. After a comfortable nights sleep we enjoyed a nice breakfast and finalized our account before taking a Raffles Limousine back to the airport. We really enjoyed our stay and were delighted with the regal ambiance of the hotel.
