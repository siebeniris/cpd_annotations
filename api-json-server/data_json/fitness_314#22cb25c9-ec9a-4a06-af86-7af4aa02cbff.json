About the only two good things I can say about this hotel is that the beds are comfy the Westin trademark bedding and the staff were nice and helpful. Unfortunately everything else is a disaster. Let me start with the room. The safety latch on my door was broken and looks like us had been for some time and when I put a towel on the rack the rack broke too. Air conditioning was very loud the toilet would not flush right and the shower dripped all night. Oh yeah the television did not work either. The question is why did not I ask to move rooms or have these all fixed and the answer is that everyone at our conference had similar issues in their rooms. The conference facilities were in very poor shape as well think gaps in room dividers no power cords along the tables etc. The food both for the conference and at the main restaurant was inedible. I walked down the street to find a few chains so I could actually eat. The fitness center is way undersized for a hotel of this size I think there are four treadmills and of course the tv on my treadmill did not work either.

The hotel is in a perfect location for people visiting Toronto who have need to be in the North York area of the city. My husband and I were visiting relatives and they all happen to live in that area so the hotel was perfect to use as our base for all the visitation. Our room was ready when we arrived which we appreciated since we had flown in from California and our flight had left very early in the morning. It was also very quiet which we really appreciated since we noticed that there were dozens of families staying there for a hockey tournament. Overall the Prince is clean comfortable and well maintained. Although the weather was not conducive to outside activities the grounds are beautiful as it backs onto a wooded area and there are tennis courts and a large swimming pool. The included breakfast was excellent with many choices and even an omelette station which we have not found to be typical in an included hotel buffet. There are also several restaurants within easy walking distance of the hotel including Tim Hortons for those wanting something other than hotel food.
