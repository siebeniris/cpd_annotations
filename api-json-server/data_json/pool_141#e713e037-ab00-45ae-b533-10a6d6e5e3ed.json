We decided to stay here and LOVED it. We paid for a garden view room but ended up having a great view of the ocean too. Black Rock is right off the beach and you can even swim to it and jump off. The water is amazing and there is even really good snorkeling right off the beach. You can rent gear from the beach shack crew near the pool. The shack managers and attendants were all so welcoming and helpful. When we asked about cabanas they told us everything we needed to know and put us in a great location right by the waterfall in the pool grotto. By the way ask about the Maui Jim sunglasses. they will change your life. On one of our last days we decided to go to the Luau held on the Sheraton lawn. They had great food an open bar a craft table and hand carved tiki sculptures. We ate and drank as the sun went down and then enjoyed a fantastic show. The fire dancer was incredible.

She ensured we had the best possible room and went above and beyond to provide us with information. We appreciated our complimentary bottle of sparkling to mark our special celebration. Thank you.

Overall a very nice hotel. Good view of the beach and pool area from the oceanview room. After the front desk staff attempted an upsel to a different room they did upgrade us from resortview to oceanview at no charge. They also gave us coupons for a free drink on our arrival day at any of the properties restaurants. The hotel is a bit removed from other attractions and I think we would have felt isolated without a car. The property is also a bit spread out. The pool area is beautiful with a lovely lazy river. The room was very standard Sheraton. I do think however that they have placed a motion sensor on the a c. I think this sounds like a good idea but it kicks off while you are sleeping as well as when you are not in the room. So then you wake up hot and have to move around to make it kick on again. The only complaint I had was the signage to find the gym. In one area of the hotel it says it is on the 3rd floor. I went to the 3rd floor and followed the signs. I looked and looked and looked. Eventually I took the elevator in that area and found a label for the gym on the 8th floor. When I got to the 8th floor I had to walk to a different area and go to the 7th floor where I eventually found the gym. Whew did not even need the workout after that. The gym was nicely equipped and had everything you would expect. The only problem was that the water cooler very fancy one did not seem to work.

The lobby is beautiful the scenery is incredible. we checked in and were off to a great start. We were upgraded to the ocean side rooms because of my husbands platinum status. We got to our room and it was nothing special. Just a king size bed a desk a TV a bathroom. I sat on the bed and the bed felt like it was at least 10 years old. I could hear the bed creaking from the springs inside. Then I looked up and saw black spots on the ceiling. I asked my husband to check it out. We were anxious to get to the pool so we just headed to the pool before our dinner reservations. We noticed hair in the bathroom so my husband called down to tell the front desk and they were like. ok we will let housekeeping know. but there was not any commitment to getting it clean. The pool area was fine infested with a TON of children which is ok. except there is no policing of the Adults only pool area which is annoying. We went back to our room to get ready for dinner. I jumped in the shower and the shower head looked like it was so dirty and just had so much built up calcium on it that it was nasty. Then I started looking around the bathroom and saw hair everywhere. Stuck to the walls by the toilet on the counter top. It was just nasty. Meanwhile my husband took a closer look at the black spots on the ceiling and they were in fact dead bugs. Like little tiny flies. So at this point my husband was pissed that I was right in feeling like this place is super grimey and had to repack all of his stuff. ON our way to dinner we stopped by the front desk and told them the situation. They offered us another room 2 doors down. We said ok and went off to dinner. They moved our stuff for us and when we returned we saw MORE BUGS than in the first room. We called again and then they moved us to a room a floor or two down. This room had bugs AND dried up contacts on the floor of the bathroom awesome. So at this point it is like 1030 PM I am 26 weeks pregnant and crabby AF. The manager was trying to help us and get us accommodated and asked what we wanted and to that my response was well I just want you to figure it out. We want a clean room that we can sleep in. so just figure it out. He gave us options of rooms in different areas or this or that and I am just like listen I do not care. Just figure it out. we are checking out tomorrow. So we finally got another room our FOURTH ROOM. and it was acceptable to sleep in. Although I woke up with bites on my belly that looked like spider bites but it is still unknown what it actually was. We paid for the room using points with SPG you stay for 4 nights you get a 5th night free. So we asked that all our points be refunded because we are not paying for this which is completely reasonable given we had FOUR DIFFERENT ROOMS and were completely displaced for an evening. They said OK and actually ended up charging us 200 points. Awesome. so now we have to deal with SPG on this which actually is probably better but it is just annoying overall. To think that we had use 200 points on this dump is just sad to think about. I heard other people at the pool talking about how their room is nice and whatnot. Maybe I am just spoiled but this was not ok the beds were not ok the hair in the bathrooms were not ok. the bugs on the ceiling most definitely were not ok. We checked out the next day and went to another Starwod property and it was much more up to what I would expect from a Starwod property. NEVER again Sheraton. NEVER. The housekeeping group has a severe deficiency but management was nice enough in trying to get it resolved but then hit us with a 200 point charge.

This hotel was not my choice my husband had a conference and we tagged along. The resort overall was comfortable beautiful grounds and sunset. cliff jumping off of black rock was fun to watch and there is a paved path along the beach to Whalers Village. There is also an Enterprise Rent A Car right on property which is very convenient. A few things to consider 1. If going in the winter the pool is not heated. My kids were disappointed that the pool water was frigid and they could not swim. A waitress at the pool bar told us they are the only resort without a heated pool which is odd to me because the pool is beautiful with a winding lazy river and a small slide and my kids stared longingly at it the entire trip. They tried getting in once and ended up with blue lips within 10 minutes so that was that. 2. The Sheraton has its own luau but buyer beware. If there is any chance of rain at all they will move it inside without telling you until you arrive for the show. I had read enough Trip Advisor reviews to know this so my husband was able to get our money refunded about 2 hours before the show because he said he would not pay that kind of money for a luau in a stuffy hotel banquet room. Unfortunately because of this we did not have time to book another one and other locations were sold out so we missed out on a luau during this trip. 3. The hotel is an open air concept. When it rains the hallway floors get soaking wet and the tile is VERY slippery. If you have mobility problems I would maybe consider a different resort. We are young and fit but slipped and fell on the tile several times. 4. The concierge is masked as a time share sales rep. If you ask for any info at all you get sucked into a speech. It was not high pressure just annoying that when you are asking for info about a whale watching tour they slip in the sales pitch. 5. Beds are super small and uncomfortable. My husband ended up sleeping on the floor the last 3 nights because the mattress was so weak. 6. It was a pretty rainy windy week when we were there and the surf was choppy most days. The last day the water was calm so we went to rent snorkels. The lady at the rental shack refused to rent them to us because she said we were not experienced enough swimmers to handle that kind of water. Which how does she know what our swimming level is. The water looked like glass and there were probably 30 other people snorkeling at the same time.

For as beautiful and competitive as the hotels are in Maui you had think a brand name like the Westin would treat guests with respect and value the business. Sadly I have found the exact opposite over the last month dealing with the Westin in Maui. We booked 4 nights with the Westin 6 months ago for a trip over the 4th of July and we were so excited to stay on the Lahaina side of the island before moving over to Wailea. I was surprised to hear 2 weeks before our trip that 2 of 5 pools were closed for renovations including the water slides. We specifically booked this hotel based on the water slides as we were traveling with a 7 year old and were staying over the 4th of July wek where everything is crowded and hot. The property DID NOT disclose the pool closures and I had called to inquire as a co worker of mine had been shocked by the closures when they went to stay a few weeks earlier. Based on the renovations and the hotel being at max occupancy that week with limited amenities I canceled my reservations within the cancelation window and booked a stay at the Sheraton. To be my surprise the day I checked in to the Sheraton I was charged a 2 night penalty by the Westin. Mind you I canceled within the reservation window and only due to the property not being what was promised when booked. I have now spent almost 5 hours trying to find resolution and still do not have my money refunded. I have been met with animosity while trying to explain and find resolution. There was even a manager Ryan who approved the refund which never came and now weeks later will not transfer to to another manager will not pass the call to Ryan and have been sent to voicemails. As a frequent traveler Mariot member and a passion for hospitality I can confidently say that this is the WORST service I have ever seen for a hotel.

Overall we had a pleasant experience at this property but several items cause me to give this property a lower rating. Upon arrival we upgraded to an ocean view which was key to our enjoyment of hotel. The front desk attendant who assisted us was very friendly and helpful although we did have to stand in line for a while. A couple of subsequent visits to front desk for change and resort calendar were inconsistent. some very friendly and some less so. Very long walk to our room but it was very nice clean and updated. But as others have commented inadequate drawer storage. Recommend the hotel adds a few hooks in the bathroom and closet for toiletry bags robes sleepwear etc. as well as an actual dresser. Housekeeping staff very friendly and accommodating. Maintenance ground miscellaneous staff not as friendly no greetings blocking walkways etc. Pool area very crowded with maybe 10 between chairs. I noted that the exterior common areas seemed tired and needed to be updated painted refreshed. Some water stations and water fountains out of order. Really. The were planter pots outside all the balconies that were all empty. I can only imagine how lovely the property was once upon a time when all those pots housed lovely flowering plants. Now it just looks barren and neglected. The only good thing is the view is unobstructed by any plants. Rock Salt main restaurant not open for lunch. Hunh. Polside bar and bq grill only lunch options. Plus the dinner menu was underwhelming and very overpriced so we did not dine there. And the polside bar closes earlyish \u2026. maybe 4 or 5. There is a Starbucks on site but I never did actually see it. When I asked the front desk they told me it was downstairs. Also did not see any sort of grab and go food items. It may be there but it is well hidden. Other than the pool area I have no idea what the 30 plus tax daily resort fee really covers as I did not see a lot of other offerings entertainment amenties to justify it. There was a daily resort calendar in the room. Problems with that 1 it was printed in color on a copier that was out of toner. Brought it to the front desk and asked for a new one and she offered the next weeks calendar with an oh well too bad you can not read it attitude. No offer to reprint a legible one. No mention of bringing it to the attention of the onsite marketing team provided there is one. Just heres another illegible calendar for next week. 2. Nothing of real appeal for adults IMHOThe nightly lighting of the torches on Black Rock is pretty cool to see depending on the actual torch lighter. One night the young man who performed the ceremony was energetic and really filled the role running along the jagged top of black rock. Another night the poor guy who was assigned the task seemed to be truly struggling to navigate the rocks. I was also perplexed by the fact that they would never light all the property torches seeming to randomly light some here and there but not all. And the snorkeling at Black Rock steps from our room was quite good. The only downside is you are jostling with lots of other snorklers and swimmers. And be careful not to veer into the path of divers off the rocks. BUT that said. definitely worth the 20 to rent a snorkel set for the day. I went out three times throughout the day and saw something different each time. In sum the location of the property is great. Room was clean bathroom large and other than severe lack of storage adequate. Easy walk all the way down to Whalers Village and other hotels for dining and shopping. Would I stay there again. Maybe. if the price was right. If the rates are the same I recommend Hyat Regency further down and walk up to Black Rock for snorkeling the only true standout about this property.", "offset": [1851, 2022], "date": "2019-08-06", "cpt": "1", "category": "pool"}, {"id": 19, "uid": "996cf76c-1078-4403-82d6-5292ef1f5b30", "sentence": "No Hawaiian Experience Whatsoever.
