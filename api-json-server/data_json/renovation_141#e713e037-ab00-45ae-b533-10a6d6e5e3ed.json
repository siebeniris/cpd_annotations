Our first visit to the resort was awesome. Everything started great. We were greeted at check in and were upgraded to Delux Ocean View. On our 1st and 2nd night the air conditioner cut out in the middle of the night and the room got pretty warm. we did not have the lanai door open after getting up and poking the buttons it started working again. Waking up the 2nd morning we had a trail of ants coming from under caps on the toilet and making their way in to the room. At this point we also noted that there is significant black mold in the caulking in the shower. I went down to the desk and reported the issues and was met with a dismissive attitude. I asked if we could move rooms and was informed that if maintenance could not fix the problems they would consider moving us. I was very nice but insited that they make an effort to move us. I was informed that the only way they would move us is to downgrade our room and move to the other side of the hotel. I am very confused as to why mold pests and a dodgy AC were my problem and why it had to be a battle to have it made right. Frusterated I called from my cell phone in the lobby and spoke with a manger over the phone and basically got the same treatment. They came in to the room sprayed for the ants and fixed the AC. A day later and the ants are back and we were greeted this morning by a very large spider hanging out in the corner of our room. Aside from the issues the beach was nice.

The godThe room is on the black rock and has a spectacular view of the ocean. The room has a large cupboard and a privacy washroom which I adore. There is a desk plenty of drawers and a fridge with small freezer and microwave. The bed is comfortable. There is a safe. Not large enough for a computer. The water pressure is good and water is hot. There are a lot of plugs for charging. The restaurant has a amazing buffet breakfast. Omelette station fish fruit is great and truly a highlight of the hotel. Great indoors outdoor seating. The grounds are lovely a little tired in spots. The black rock is a focal point for viewing snorkeling and swimming. There were lots of fish in the water and some turtles too. You can see the whales tails breaching from the pool. There are three pools. All have an amazing view. They are freezing. The beach path is great and easy to access. The chairs are bountiful and have cushions. There is sun or shade. The pool staff were great. Very helpful. Rafi Aaron were very nice. They come around mid afternoon with frezies nice touch. I recommend you organize your cabanas or twin chairs with roof tops before you come. They remove towels on chairs that are unused after one hour. There is bar service at the chairs. Food at the pool is quite good. Restaurant is pleasant. Fitness room is great. It has all amenities and water and oranges too. The business area is fine. Computer and a printer. The badThe rooms are dated and need to be renovated. Three star at best. We were happy with the size of the room and the cleaning service. Our room was missing a side table and lamp. It was brought to the room in about five hours. did not sPend much time in the room. I know that is true but aesthetically pleasing is a must. The cost of these rooms is out of touch with their condition. The cabanas are not special. Truly need to be updated. No coolers regular chairs with towels. Furniture is in need of replacement. Get cabana D it has the best location and room for chairs in front. Cabana b is by the kids pool area but that is a non issue. Quite private. I had to get my own outside chairs for chairs in the sun. As there are non with the cabana. We enjoyed the twin chairs with the roof cover and thick cushions. We had 19 and 20. Does not provide much shade though. Check inVery good. Gabriel was excellent. Spg gold does not get any privileges. Example free valet water in the room that was disappointing. We received pukka shells necklaces. Nice touch. The self parking is beside building six so that was perfect. 250 a day seems too much. Should be included in the resort fee. Taxes are crazy high. Be aware. Seems to be a touch of a money grab. LocationIf you do not mind the walk then you are good to go with this hotel. We were okay with it after we figured it out. You need to go in three elevators to get to breakfast or to the pools. The hotel location is lovely. Beside the golf course walkable to whalers shops. We really enjoyed the monkey pod restaurant. Row of hotels. Lovely walk on beach. Now the most disappointing thing we did not know. There is no sand on the beach. Why. It was explained to me that the tide takes the sand down to the Weston in the winter and then redeposits back on the Sheraton side in the spring. Did not stop anyone from getting in the ocean. Just no where to sit on the beach. Staff are not overaly nice or enthusiastic. Felt like they were going through the motions. Polite and professional. Is that enough. We stayed in Honolulu and kuaui where the staff were so welcoming. Quite a contrast. Except for Gabriel front desk and Donna at the pool service. They were the exceptions very nice and helpful too.

A couple hours later I walked to the front desk and was told the room would be finished shortly but it was a smaller room with one king size bed. They said they would accommodate with a rolaway bed. I thought I better look at it. I did and it was way too small. So after waiting all day I asked if they had anything higher they did. so we moved two floors higher. Still not ocean front. The resort is old the bathrooms are small and in desperate need of renovation. The tile grout was dirty the sink smelled like sewage and the beach was washed away. No where to sit on the beach because of erotion and so many locals. The icing on the cake was at checkout. They charged us ocean front for an ocean view room. They insisted it was ocean front because we could see the ocean from our room. I am a seasoned traveler and I have never heard of that before. I would never stay at this property again. I booked through SPG and they were not aware of the renovations. The property failed to notify them. I was also told that we would receive 35 off at the black rock restaurant. We ate there once for breakfast and it was terrible. At checkout they did not honor that either. The hotel said it was only on dinner. They charged me for valet when i never used it 31 a day.

As a MARIOT Titanium Elite I booked on points used suite upgrades and was upgraded to their largest suite for the stay. Elite status also got us free self parking and the choice of a 250 resort credit or free breakfast for the entire family. This was a no brainer go for the breakfast. The Buffet has everything and the staff there went out of their way to recognize my status and make sure we knew they were there for us Mac and Gavyn. The pool here is good. It \u2019s not the best pool I \u2019ve ever seen but it has plenty of areas and depths and the water never felt crowded. Like any resort the pool at a spring break can run short on chairs. We rented a cabana the two days we wanted to be at a pool beach. For 150 day it was worth it for us to have space shade and no worries about someone trying to take our chair. The concessionaire that does that and hands out towels was very friendly and helpful each day we were at the beach. Right next to the pool the staff set up soccer corn hole lawn bowling etc every day which our kid loved to be able to go and play as well as meet other kids. The beach at Black Rock has eroded a bit from winter storms so right I front of the hotel there is n\u2019t a ton of room to sit on the sand but take a 5 min stroll south and the beach starts to widen and you can easily find a spot to spread out on the beach. The best part about this hotel is there is world class snorkeling right off the beach. We snorkeled it twice. Tip the earlier in the day you go the calmer the water tends to be. There is a concessionaire right there who rents equipment. The suite we were upgraded to was recently renovated and was a very large one bedroom suite. It was on the top floor. The balcony was big and had a beautiful view. Pic belowWe did the Luau one night. My husband and son enjoyed it.

If I were management during a prolonged overhaul of such a critical aspect of the resort experience as the arrival location I would ensure that customer service would be so surprisingly delightful that a guest did n\u2019t realize they were being greeted in a temporary setting. Instead it seems that the marching orders were to be so unenthusiastic that expectations about the surroundings were kept in check. The location is marred by weird tacky oversights like a plexiglass window into a dingy little office in complete view of the signature restaurant hostess table where a guest must place take out breakfast orders through a hole \u2014 like he or she is bailing someone out of jail. A similarly bizarre view into the rental car company \u2019s back office is afforded from the entrance drive.

Almost every phone call started with a bright \u201c Aloha \u201d. and then when I asked to be transferred or whatever I had to ask the voice fell into a lower disinterested overly casual not island relaxed tone. They might have well said \u201c whatever \u201d at the end of each call. Again though this attitude of disinterest did not extend to the workers who actually did stuff.
