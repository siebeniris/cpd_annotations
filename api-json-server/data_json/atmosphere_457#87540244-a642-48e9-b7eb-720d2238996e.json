I have just returned from the W after staying for 2 nights for my Husbands 40th. We have two young children and we left the kids behind for some pure luxury and grown up time. The W is stunning. Barcelona is an amazing city which we have visited many times. This time we wanted to go and just lay by a pool and drink cockails and eat great food. from the moment youarive you are looked after ny The Beautiful people. If style and glamour is what you like then this Hotel is for you. Beware though it really is a place that is full of stunningly beautiful people and the vibe is that of high end glamour. The room even the basic Wonderful room that we stayed in was awesome and looked out onto the ocean. It was spacious with plenty of room and felt luxurious despite being the cheapest room choice. The cocktails by the pool are gorgeous and the staff attentive you really do not need to ever leave the Hotel for anything. The only slight criticism is that there are not enough sunbeds by the pool but you know its a small price to pay for such an awesomely cool place. There are some amazing little restauranst below the Hotel along the seafront. Gilato is lovely and serves Tapas and small plates great vibe and great food if you want something different. At night the pool area or rather Wet Bar as its called has lovely music playing glamourous people and you can sit there until 1 am soaking up the atmosphere. This is a place where grown ups can be grown ups and remember a time before kids and resposnibilities. The right for an amazing break for a couple. However. It is very glamourous so bring your best garms and if you are in the least bit insecure about your body image stay away. There are stunners a plenty from the door men and receptionists to the lady that opens the door for you by the pool. Its like LA in Europe. Loved it.

We ate at one of the restaurants below the hotel at beach level that was open air They all were down there and it had several kinds of Paella. We had the seafood. I am not a huge fan of squid too rubbery. BUT not there. It was cut length wise and it was so good. It looks like a pretty small amount and it was not a beautiful color but it was incredible and all 3 thought so. We could not finish it. The salad was below average that comes with it. The tomato bread was pretty good. Marc the host was really wonderful and made my 81yr old aunt feel special. We ate there both nights. We all loved Marc. But also Concierge desk was very helpful. I loved walking the beach promenade. Seriously it would be worth it to stay here again just to stroll along that wide open space with the breeze coming over that beautiful bay. Wow. All kinds of cool activities going on on both sides of the very wide promenade. Not crowded like Las Ramblas Area I always stayed in before and recommend.

There were no slippers in the room either for a 5 star hotel. Next morning we told front desk about the noisy AC and she said maintenance will go n see if it can be fixes. We left and came back around 430pm only to find that it is still noisy and no note message was left on how it is to be resolved. So here we are ringing up reception again and they sent some guys up and from the vibes it seems that the AC can not be fixed and told us front desk would call us to see what can be done. I got a phonecal soon and the staff told me that it is a normal AC noise. At this moment I was fuming and said are you telling me that all rooms have the same noise. We have been to 7 other W hotels around the world and this has to be the worst. Do n\u2019t be fooled by the hotel \u2019s super nice exterior or the W brand name. they finally agreed to change us to a smaller room not a suite on a higher floor with ocean view and an extra bed inside for free which they said is \u20ac 100 per night. Despite this cost it is still cheaper than our original suite and they refused to refund the difference. I \u2019m sick of arguing and it \u2019s already ruining our holidays so we left it as it is. even so the maintenance in the room is so lacking. power points not working hot water overpowering. at least the AC is quiet now. honestly spend your money elsewhere.
