We have a very well behaved black lab Lady Bug and our stays meet every ones needs to the best level money could buy. The staff is helpful friendly professional and entertaining. The area around the Westin has plenty of room for lady bug to stretch her legs check out rabbits ducks geese and go for a swim in lake close to the area. We have had several dinning opportunities from breakfast to late night dinners with just a great selection of meals and great prices. we have tried other SPG hotels in the area but none compare to the quality of service we receive at the Westminster Westin.

Nice hotel although I think the maintenance could be improved the bathtub did not drain well in our room and the toilet flush mechanism broke the morning we were leaving. Some peeling wallpaper in the bath. Good amenities including the pool hot tub and work out center.

The room was good for the one night we were staying. There is free wifi in the lobby but otherwise you have to pay 12 a day which is ridiculous. As they advertised free wifi they conveniently left out that it was only in their lobby. I have stayed in plenty of hotels worse off than this and they all offered free wifi. The refrigerator in the room barely kept things cold and we also had the room air conditioning unit cranked down as low as it would go the whole time we were there and it did not seem to cool the room off at all. The hallways were extremely hot so going from a hot hallway to a room with air conditioning would have been nice but we could barely tell a difference. The staff was all pretty friendly. The pool and hot tub area were nice. When I booked the room it also said it was a high rise corner king bedroom. We were on the 4th floor.
