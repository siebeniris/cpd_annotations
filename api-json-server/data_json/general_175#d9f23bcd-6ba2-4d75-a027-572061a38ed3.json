The food was extraordinary and the space very accommodating feeling very private and safe. In the last month I have heard back from guests who loved the venue convenient location food and services. Also our florist and other outside contractors that we had said to us that out of all the hotels they have worked with that The Westin Philadelphia was the kindest most professional easy to work with that they have experienced from loading docks to actual site work. A big statement but it truly seemed there was nothing The Westin Phily could not do better from last minute needed video equipment set up or a private boardroom for an extra side event. all were accommodated beautifully.

We have a friend who is first rule of travel is to never accept the first room offered by a hotel. Lately he seems like a genius. When we checked into the Westin yesterday we were given a key to a tiny room next to the elevator which was reeking of cigarette smoke. The next room was larger brighter and only smelled of recirculated air. Bed was very comfortable with excellent bed linens. The bathroom was decent size but with shower in tub and shower curtain. Very stingy with towels had to ask for robes and virtually no amenities in bathrom no shower cap cotton balls etc. Just a sliver of soap and extremely generic shampoo and conditioner. Another to our mind. annoying feature of the hotel is the street level elevator which only goes to the third floor lobby. Then you have to walk over to the other elevator bank to get to the room floors. Every time you enter exit the hotel you have to wait for and take two elevators. Finally the goal of a good hotel should be hospitality. You should feel welcome. You should not be greeted with a sign that says if you touch the in room refrigerator the sensor will go off. And that if you want to store your items DO NOT put them in the refrigerator. They will bring you a refrigerator AT AN EXTRA CHARGE.

My boyfriend and I stayed at the Westin Philadelphia the weekend after Christmas for two nights and our room was broken into room 802 next to the elevators. We realized it a couple hours after we returned to our room that day after receiving a notification from my credit card company that my card had been used at a few stores in the area. I had not actually taken that credit card out of the hotel room at any point so we checked through the rest of our stuff and realized that my boyfriends laptop had also been taken. I am shocked at how the Westin staff and Mariot corporate has handled this situation over the last month. At no time has the fact that our room was broken into actually been addressed. It took weeks of follow ups phone calls and emails to get any kind of response from anyone which was ultimately that they will not be able to help us. We immediately reported the theft to the hotel staff and after about 15 20 minutes a security officer and the Assistant Front Desk Manager Christopher Fries came to our room to take a report. He let us know that we could speak further with Karim Ware the Director of Guest Services the next morning. Throughout our entire experience with Karim he was flippant and unprofessional and clearly had no interest in concern about or sense of urgency with this entire situation. Each time we followed up with him for an update we were told that he would be getting in touch with us after a few more days. Each time we did not hear back from him so we again had to follow up. We were also told that Westin would be conducting their own investigation into what happened and although we have asked multiple times for the outcome of this investigation and for surveillance footage our requests were ignored. I also emailed Mariot corporate about this and about two weeks later I received a response from Debra Camperud a Corporate Liaison of Consumer Affairs with the frankly laughable excuse that the hotel is simply not responsible for thefts and that was it. Again my request to have the outcome of their investigation was completely ignored. The morning after the incident Karim said that he ran a report of the electronic key card activity for our room and that our door was actually left open while we were out. I find this extremely difficult to believe. I work in the travel industry and travel quite often through the US and South America and it is engrained in my travel habits especially in cities to close the door tightly behind me. We also were sure to place the Do Not Disturb sign on the door before we left because we did not want housekeeping to enter and since a housekeeper was right outside our door when we left we checked the sign and the door again before leaving. Karim also told us our door was ajar again later in the evening when we were in the room and had already called security to report the theft. I was there looking at the closed door waiting for them to arrive so if the door was ajar it is very obviously a problem with the door not functioning properly. Chris the first manager also commented to us that our door when closed seemed off like there was more of a gap in the door than there should be. I can only assume at this point that this was an inside job that an employee of the Westin knows that their doors are faulty and took advantage. You need a key to get to the 8th floor and what is more interesting is that my credit card was taken out of my wallet and the laptop was taken out of a bag and both were closed back up and put back where they were. Whoever did it clearly wanted to be very subtle and did not want us to immediately notice that anything was missing. I do not know if the staff at Westin is trying to protect someone or what but the complete lack of concern on Karim and Debras part is just unbelievable.", "offset": [1108, 1215], "date": "2020-02-02", "cpt": "1", "category": "general"}, {"id": 11, "uid": "2bc1133e-7545-4a00-9867-8bb6889b648d", "sentence": "Property is under construction or renovation.
