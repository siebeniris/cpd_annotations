My wife and I spent 6 days at Paradisus Cancun with our three grown children ages 2321 and 18. Although we did not sign up for Royal Service minimum age 18 when we originally booked the trip it was offered to us at check in and we are thrilled we took advantage of it for the additional cost it was a great value. Royal Service has its own building private pool beach and a couple of great outdoor restaurants for breakfast and lunch. it is only a 3 minute walk to the main building Tower 3. Tower 3 houses all restaurants clubs and entertainment if you stay in that tower be prepared for some late night noise. We met a family that put towels around their door to try and block the sound. Royal Service includes a butler who is with you all week basically a concierge for roughly 6 families at a time. Our butler Rodrigo was really great he handled dinner reservations and helped us plan our week which eliminated much of that where do we go tonight stress hint for dinner reservations make them in advance the most popular places fill up quickly. Vento and Bana were our favorites my boys all loved Market Grill I am a vegetarian and they very nicely offered to make me a polenta dish. The food was really good all over the resort a nice surprise for an all inclusive. At the pool Bernardo and Arturo who run the beach pool area for Royal Service were super especially given the challenges of a holiday week. The resort was full and to say there was a shortage of lounge chairs is putting it mildly. One thing that appealed to us about Royal Service was that I would not have to get out there by 7 am and save chairs but if you did not claim chairs by 8 am it would be tough to find them that was a bummer. Why Paradisus does not keep extra lounge chairs in storage for the busy weeks is a mystery to me. Additionally the pool servers Francisco and Rogilio were great and Samuel the pool bartender was the best. The only other negative which is specific only to the holiday was the New Years Eve party. The charge was 235 per person and it was not worth it. The venue was small the food was okay the dancers were good however we saw them perform every other night of the week in the main building for free. The music was awful there was a soloist during cocktails and she was fun but the rest of the night was bad my kids could not wait to get out of there. We stayed at the Moon Palace 2 years ago and their New Years Eve Party blew this one out of the water. The issues with lounge chairs a couple screw ups with dinner reservations and the New Years Eve disappointment are the only reasons we did not rate this as excellent. The food friendly staff cleanliness beach and the weather we had that week were excellent. We would go back.", "offset": [1347, 1486], "date": "2015-01-18", "cpt": "0", "category": "pool"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "88f2e8be-0088-4b43-8bb4-f30912b46743", "sentence": "Plus and cons of Paradisus Cancun. 5th February 2015 We are back from a 11 days stay at Paradisus Cancun. The hotel was beautiful and the staff was outstanding.

Bana restaurant Guadelupe. front desk Efrain Rogelio and all barman bars Samuel Fares Ismael Felipe Carlos. Tempo restaurant Luis and many other. Market Place restaurant Nayela and all staff concierge desk. There are many others who helped make our stay memorable. Thank you to all these people for that. The beach was beautiful except for walking we prefer to walk ON the sand rather than IN the sand. There were a lot of waves some rather large it was difficult to get out of the water. There were many chairs on the site that were not on the beach but still gave THE view of the beach. There was a pool overflowing in the Royal club pool that was heated. In January it made for a very pleasant swim. BARS. Service at all bars was outstanding and the alcohol list was filled with top of the line brands. FOOD. This is were we have a mixed opinion. Breakfast and lunch were OK Most restaurants a la carte were barely OK. The quality of the meats was the culprit example beef almost all commercial grade. If you wanted higher quality Angus you had to pay extrabetwen 45 and 100 extra as shown on the included price list on the table. Choices on the menus were very limited with flamboyant names to describe very common food. Service was always very good. Restaurant reservation were a pain they accepted only one reservation in advance that is for the next day only and it only could be done after 9 am. Time lost every day. Paradisus prides itself in having on site a privately owned restaurant whose owner has altogether 6 Michelin stars. We were to Paradisus La Perla 2 years ago and we tried the first of these private restaurants called Passion. The water and house wines were included since we were staying at Paradisus La Perla. It cost us 40 Us per person for the degustation menu. All different plates were outstanding 1010. Tempo the equivalent restaurant. at Paradisus Cancun charges for water and wines. They refused to serve us regular bottled water and house wines and served branded water and relatively cheap wines at a cost of around 100 US. The food was mostly very good except for a few plates that carried flamboyant names and consisted of not much. 710. Price after water and wines was around 55 US per person. ROOM. Very clean and comfortable. The whole site is very clean. All in all we probably would not go back to this hotel because for us food is very important and also there are better beaches to walk on. The weather was marvelous.

We stayed in the Royal Service and our Butler Hector was absolutely wonderful. It was so nice to come back to you room after a day at the pool or beach to find a bubble bath topped with rose pedals. He knew just the right touch. The food was surprisingly very good for an all inclusive. Waiters and waitresses were very attentive and we wanted for nothing. My experience at the Spa was great. I would definitely recommend the hot stone massage. It was a great week of rest relaxation mixed in with lots of laughs with family. Royal Service is definitely the best decision we made and are planning our trip back again next year. I think the stairs outside should have some more lighting there are places that are very dark.

We had a fabulous stay the first week of Feb 2015. We were welcomed promptly in the lobby and escorted to the royal service lobby. Angel greeted us in the concierge lobby for check in. He made the process easy and even allowed us to check in early. Our butler was Rode. He was very attentive. Thank you Rode for all of your help and kindness in making our vacation relaxingThe breakfast and afternoon snacks in the royal service lobby were wonderful. Fresh healthy and delicious. The setting is beautiful. Tropical plants and a koi fish pond make for beautiful scenery while you enjoy your snack meal coffee or cocktail. One night there was a beautiful show 3 men singing We were getting ready for dinner while the show was on in the lobby so we did not see the show but we could hear it in our room. It was early and not disruptive at all. In fact that was the only thing we heard in our room all week. Our rooms were very comfortable quiet and clean. We enjoyed lunch at La Palapa overlooking the beautiful pool and ocean. The pool waiter Fransisco was great. The royal service pools are both beautiful and the bali beds are extremely comfyEdie took care of us by the beach. He was so fun. He brought us waters with out even asking and kept the drinks coming. We could just relax all day. The beach at paradisus is stunning. Crystal clear water with just the right amount of waves. It truly feels like paradiseAfter soaking up the sun and wanting to take a nap we ordered room service and enjoyed lunch on the balcony. The food was delicious and the service was fast. The Caprese salad was the best I have ever hadWe had dinner at The Market Grill the first night which was like a Brazilian steakhouse. The atmosphere was laid back resort casual. The food and service were great. We had to keep flipping the coin to pause the food. there is definitely no shortage there. We also had dinner at Fuego which was good. We were not aware that Cancun did not change their time as of Feb 1st. So we operated an hour behind schedule all day and showed up to our dinner reservation an hour late. This was no problem for the staff. We figured out after dinner why they seemed slightly rushed to get our meals out before closingThe chocolate martinis on the beautiful couches of the Avenue Bar made for a fantastic evening watching a show. From acrobatics to rapingthe show was great and we had a fun time hereThe Blue Agave which is described as a taco bar The salsas were outstanding. They were of course spicy and authentic. The tacos were amazing. Fast service. Blue Agave will not disappoint for lunch. Mole was our favorite and most memorable dinning experience at the hotel. There was entertainment for dinner. Beautiful guitar and vocalists. The decor is warm stylish and inviting. Oscar was our waiter. He was by far the best server we had on the property. He was very friendly and clearly has a love and knowledge for food and culture. He pleasantly described the dishes and made our dinning experience at Mole an evening to remember. I can not wait to return just to have the mole sauce againThe hotel overall is beautiful. It is true that it is very large but it makes exploring fun. We enjoyed walking the property after all the food we were eating. We did get lost a time or two but the staff is so friendly they will just happily direct you where to go. There are also maps of the property all over. We enjoyed our vacation very much. Thank You Paradisus for a wonderful stay and all of your hard work.

When we booked this spring break trip for my wife and I and our kids 6 and 4 we were going off of a recommendation of a friend. We booked the trip through CheapCaribeancom which went smoothly. We elected to upgrade our room to the Family Concierge Oceanfront Room. I wish we would have gotten a suite though. One of my complaints about Paradisus was that we booked a room that had a King sized bed and a pull out couch. Having a 6 and 4 year old on a pull out couch is a recipe for disaster. Luckily my in laws had decided to also book the trip with us and they were able to take one of the kids or both with them most nights. Other then the tight quarters I would definately book a suite next time on to the positives. Our butler Ramon was really great. They gave us a phone to directly contact him but he was always around trying to find ways to improve our stay. The family concierge has its own suite for check in check out and a top shelf bar barista and kids snacks. It was tough to keep my son out of there. When our butler had a day off most staff seem to work 6 days per week. Oscar did a great job helping us with all of the details of our trip. He even arranged for a private moonlit dinner on the beach and went along with a story I made up so that my wife would be surprised. Paradisus staff members who stood out to me were Pool Bartender Christian very friendly and upbeat each day. If you go order a BC with Malibu and tell him that a bartender in Phily told you to ask for it. Waitstaf Edie for the romantic dinner Eric at the sushi restaurant and Irving at the authentic Mexican restaurant. I could go on and on about the staff especially the buffet staff and indoor and outdoor lunch staff. After a couple of days even the hostesses knew us and could tell me where my family was sitting if I came in after they were already seated. By the pool all of the waitstaf were really on top of drink service. Buckets of bottled water and drinks every 10 minutes. There was a lady Flor who was really good nachos and wings by the pool. I really do not know how anyone could complain about the food or the service. Ramon made reservations a day in advance and each restaurant was a new experience. Spa expensive 150 for a 50 min massage. ouch. steam room and sauna broken. That would have been nice after morning workouts. The brightest spot believe it or not was Esteban the ceramics guy by the kids pool. My son was all upset after he painted a statue. He said he would fix it and sure enough it looked awesome the next day. So much so that I painted another Day of the Dead skull the next day with my son and he finished it up with really detailed cool stuff after we were done. Beautiful navy blue turquoise blue light blue water each and every day.

Only slight improvements needed. My husband and I are Club Melia their vacation club members. We stayed at the resort from late April through early May of 2015. It was our first time at this resort. I am noting that we are club members as I believe it is a different experience. I also had a difficult time finding reviews from a club members experience. This may be lengthy but I will try to give a detailed review of our visit. We arranged an airport transfer through a link sent to us by the resort. It was a private van inexpensive and a smooth pick up. The resort is 15 20 minutes from the airport. There is a main entrance and also one for club members. Our driver dropped us off at the main entrance. I tried to ask the bellman if we were in the correct spot but I think he misunderstood me. They took our luggage and gave us a ticket for it. After another person checked our name we were told we needed to check in at the Club Melia desk. At other Paradisus resorts the greeters walk you to a check in area offer a moist towel etc. This person walked with a few feet and then pointed directions to the club lobby. It was not the best introduction to the resort. We would have appreciated someone walking us to the proper location. When we arrived at the club member check in desk a woman who I did not see again during our visit worked with us. She did not seem familiar at all with Club Melia or member benefits. She handed us a paper with general hotel information including a phone number for restaurant reservations. I said I was told that we would be assigned someone to make the reservations as they did at other Paradisus resorts. She seemed confused and then asked if we were club members. That concerned me as were at the club check in desk. At that point I was questioning our choice in staying at this resort. She then introduced us to someone who would be able to assist us and answer any questions. That person was Bladimir. He was the club butler assigned to work with us during our stay. Bladimir immediately made us feel comfortable with our decision to vacation at this resort. He went over the different restaurants and offered to make a reservation for us that evening for dinner. He answered any of our initial questions and took notes as to our preference of dinner time mini bar requests etc. Bladimir was wonderful. He was in constant contact with us throughout our stay. He arranged gifts in our room and made us feel like his top priority. He is an asset to this resort. The following are my thoughts on the room restaurants pool etc. Our RomWe chose a one bedroom suite. We were lucky enough to get a room with an ocean view. The view was breathtaking. The room itself was perfect for two people. While it did not have a separate shower from the tub it was fine with us. The sleeping area had a king size bed desk and tv. There was also a small dining table sleeper sofa and kitchenette. The balcony had a chair lounge chair and jetted tub. Overall we found the room to be very nice. It was not brand new looking but it was still an above average room. Mini barIt was stocked with water beer soda diet and regular potato chips and oreos. They filled it on a daily basis. One day they did not restock it and after we called it was immediately filled. The only improvement would be to add additional items of things that they noticed we drank on a daily basis. For example we prefer Coca Cola Light and it would have been nice to have an extra one of two each day. HousekepingThey did a great job of cleaning each day. Once they did not restock our shampoo or bars of soap. That was an issue as we realized it while my husband was in the shower. I called the front desk to ask for some. After that we had several extra of each placed in our room on a daily basis. The only other improvement would be to add extra large towels each day. Some days we only received two. Four would have been nice as we each use two to shower. As I said overall they did an excellent job cleaning our room and we appreciated their hard work PolClub members do not have a private pool but our section of the pool is shared with Family Concierge. The pool is large but not the largest I have seen. It has a couple of jetted areas a swim up bar and the far end of it is the member and Family Concierge section. The downside is that it is not a private area for club members. Even though our paperwork when we checked in mentioned our own pool area that is not the case. It is all one pool. We noticed couples without club wrist bands hanging out in our jetted area and kind of taking over that section. That was a little annoying considering we spend quite a bit of money to become members. But they probably did not realize it and thought it was a quieter part of the pool. Bali beds need to be reserved and they include two lounge chairs to the left of each bed. Members received two free days of beds by the pool or beach. Additional days were 10 per day. We did not have one reserved for our first day as we got to the pool around 5 pm. We found some chairs near the swim up bar end of the pool. Polside drink service ends around 530 but we were able to get a couple of drinks before it ended. The swim up bar was a bit crowded but not to the point where we would not have been able to get drinks. That end of the pool tends to get a little loud but not out of control. It is just a bit more rowdy at times. On our second day we met Jose the pool concierge. He arranged a bed by the pool for the additional days of our stay. Jose was wonderful. He made sure that we had a bed in a quieter part of the pool as he knew we were not there with children. He also reserved the same bed for us each day. It was stocked with towels and set up for us each day before we arrived at the pool. I highly recommend reserving a bed. It made a huge difference to our stay. Club Melia beds overlook the beach. The view is the nicest I have ever had on vacation. The polside servers were great too. They usually brought over a bucket of beer and ice to start us off. Throughout the day they replaced our ice and refilled our drinks. They also brought us mixed drinks shots etc. They probably checked on us every half hour or so. They also brought us food from the Sunset Grill. The servers were all great but Miguel and Sofonia really stood out to me. Sofinia always greeted us by name and brought our favorite drinks before even asking us. He was awesome. Miguel kept our drinks coming and even brought one that he thought I might like to try. He also reminded us before the Sunset Grill closed for the day or let us know if La Perla a sit down restaurant was open for the afternoon. BeachUnlike some other Paradisus resorts the beach here is right next to the pool. Our Bali beds by the pool overlooked the beach. The sand was powder white and the water was the most beautiful shades of turquoise to deep blue. There were Bali beds and chairs available on the beach. We usually left a few things on our bed by the pool and carried anything of value such as our phones or iPads in a bag with us. They offered drinks by the beach. I am pretty sure food was available there too. We did not ask for any so I can not say for sure if you can get food there. One annoying thing is that we walked down with full drinks put our bag and towels on chairs only to return to our drinks having been taken away. It is an all inclusive so we did not lose money on them but it seemed like it was a little fast to take them as well as a waste of good drinks. I really loved the location of the beach vs the pool. It was so convenient to take a quick dip in the ocean and then relax in the pool. We did not have to choose one over the other for the day. WifiThe signal was strong throughout our room. Everywhere else it was hit or miss. It did not work in most restaurants. It was especially disappointing that it did not work well by the pool. I enjoy checking my email and surfing the web while I relax by the pool. On one occasion I really needed to email someone for an important matter and I had to leave the pool area to take care of it. If they could work on improving the signal and coverage that would make a big difference for guests. Dress CodeVery casual. A lot of the guests dressed a little too casual for my taste. Many of the men were wearing concert type or printed t shirts shorts and flip flops for dinner. Some women were in short shorts and tank tops. I tend to wear maxi dresses with sandals for dinner. For the most part my husband wore polo shirts khakis and boat shoes. A couple of nights he wore cargo shorts with a polo. Room ServiceThe menu is limited but it is available 24hrs. The wait is about 45 minutes so be prepared for that BreakfastNaos is the buffet breakfast restaurant. It is an average size buffet for a resort. They have two stations with omelettes and eggs made to order. They have all of your standard breakfast items like pancakes sausage cereal juices etc. They have a large variety of breads for toasting. The bacon was a little undercoked for my taste but it was not a big issue for me. They also have an area with smoothies with a new daily recipe. Another nice touch was a self serve bloody mary section with assorted vodkas. Champagne and mimosas were also available from the servers. I think it was a great breakfast with something for everyone. Martin was especially friendly and gave us great service on more than one occasion. LunchFor the most part we ate by the pool and had food from the Sunset Grill. The polside servers can bring it to you or you can take a seat around the grill. It is a self serve restaurant that is part of the pool area. They have potato chips fries pizza chicken wings nachos veggie burgers and a few other things. The variety is greater than I have had at other Paradisus resorts. They close down a little after 5 and are not shy about pulling food away even if people are still trying to take some. One day I wanted to grab some nachos before closing. My husband was considering a hot dog. Even though there were people in line and food was still available they still took it away. we turned our heads and the hot dogs were gone. The cheese for the nachos had been taken away too. I understand they needed to close. I do think they could have let what was left run out since people were in line and obviously wanted some food. That was the only negative about the Sunset Grill. Another lunch option was La Perla. On occasion they were open for a buffet lunch. They usually had a few desserts salad fried shrimp fried calamari and other fish for tacos. The restaurant is an open air style and overlooks the pool. One day we tried Naos for the lunch buffet. This is the largest buffet option for lunch. It was nice but I did not love it. Nothing really stood out as special. We sat outside by the Market Grill. They also had a one page menu of food to order. If you do not like staying by the pool or beach it is a nice option. I really loved relaxing by the pool so I was in a hurry to get back to our Bali bed DinerMole Mexican restaurant indoors. Excellent service Oscar our waiter knew our names and greeted us. Very good food. Not rushed at all. Oscar made us feel very relaxed and welcome. He was the best waiter we had during our trip. He is an asset to the resort. Market Gril open air restaurant. Rodizio style. They serve a variety of meats on what looks like spears or swords. The concept is great. Unfortunately we felt very rushed. We finished within an hour. My husband was in restroom and they skipped some meats while he was gone. They said they did not want it to be cold when we returned to the table. The problem is they never came back around with the meats he missed. They then assumed we were done eating when we said we were taking a break as the food was brought out one on top of another. Before we could say something they started mentioning desserts. By that point we chose a dessert and called it a night. We were very disappointed as this was our favorite restaurant at Paradisus in Playa del Carmen. Vento. indoor restaurant. tapas. They recommended two cold one salad three hot per person. Excellent food and very nice looking restaurant Fuego indoor restaurant. Food was good as well as the service. Main course did not have sides. More al a cart. Portions were smalBana indoor restaurant. mostly sushi. Excellent service. Best dinner location in the resort. Located by the entrance lobby in the middle of everything. Miguel was an excellent waiter. He gave us great service and wonderful recommendations for our meal. La Perla open air restaurant near club side of pool. Pasta and Steak. Only open certain nights for dinner. The service was so so. Waiter introduced himself and then handed us bottles of water. Small salad bar with four pasta varieties and grilled vegetables. Assorted sausages that waiter brings you. Meat entrees are brought over by waiter. Tenderloin was awful. Over cooked and terrible gamey flavor. Could not eat it. Dessert was decent. would not go back. They did not offer coffee or after dinner drinks or more water. They also took husbands champagne glass without offering anything else. This was the worst meal of our tripPrivate Dinner On The Beach Club Melia arranged a private dinner for us on the beach. It was spectacular. The service was outstanding and the food was perfect. I highly recommend trying this Bars AlcoholI found the variety of top shelf alcohol to be above my expectation. They offered Grey Goose at most bars. The house wine was decent. I would not expect much as far as wine at an all inclusive resort. They had some available to purchase but I did not find it necessary. Avenue Bar Nightly shows take place at this bar. Seating is limited and without a seat it can be hard to see the shows. We skipped most of them. We did stop by this bar after dinner for drinks. Service is slow if you are not at the bar itself. Red Lounge the club lounge and only option for drinks after midnight. do not expect a large party atmosphere. It is a small club with a couple of bartenders and servers. It was fine for us. A younger crowd may prefer to leave the resort and visit a larger bar or clubConventions One thing to note is that this resort hosts conventions. During our stay Pandora jewelry held a sales convention there. I was told there were 60 attendees. On our last full day at the pool workers were setting up several tables and a bar for a private cocktail party for Pandora. The problem is they set up right on top of our lounge chairs and bed. I mean right next to us. The back of our chairs touched the chairs they set up. While the people at the bed next to us were away for lunch they pushed their lounge chairs forward and moved a huge bar behind them. I was stunned. After a week of phenomenal service they completely disregarded our presence and disrupted the relaxing afternoon that we were all trying to have. I would say they set up a little after 1 pm. I spoke with other guests who were also club members and they felt the same way about it. By 3 pm they pretty much pushed us out of our bed. We asked Jose for another location. He was very apologetic. I considered it the fault of whichever department was setting up the party. They clearly did not care about the guests around them. When we went to our new bed a woman next to us was speaking loudly on her cell phone. For at least 20 minutes she went on and on about reports etc. I told my husband to ignore it even though she was loud and rude as she was using her bed space. When she finished she walked to a table by the pool. I realized she was part of the convention and it was not her bed. I guess she did not want to be rude in front of her coworkers but it was ok to take over a space she did not reserve. Now I wish my husband had said something to her. I guess my point about the woman is to be aware that convention attendees do not always behave the same as guests on vacation and you may have to deal with that. I took photos of the bar set up that forced us out of our bed. I will try to post them later. Final ThoughtsFor the most part this was a fabulous vacation. The service we received was outstanding. We went in not expecting much and left extremely impressed. Most of the people we encountered went out of their way to make our stay special. Valeria the club concierge was a excellent. She was always so friendly and cheerful. We would absolutely return to this resort. Also I am a firm believer in tipping for good service. I know it is not required but my husband and I always try to tip well when we travel. We never ordered drinks without tipping. We tipped at every meal. Even when the service was not up to our expectations we left something. Of course we also took care of our butler and housekeeping. In most cases a small tip made a huge difference in the service we received. I could also see how much they appreciated it. I am always amazed at the number of people I see who do not tip. Try to keep in mind that a dollar or two may not be much for you but it could really make a persons day.", "offset": [14428, 14551], "date": "2015-05-10", "cpt": "0", "category": "pool"}, {"id": 7, "uid": "582f7943-16d5-440c-a9ff-d126ce8bd8b6", "sentence": "Swimming pool is the best.

Just returned from a 7 day stay. We stayed in a Deluxe junior suite ocean view Royal Service pyramid 5. This is the way to go if you want a great vacation with excellent Royal Service. Rooms are clean lovely and comfortable. As rooms move up the pyramid the rooms are a bit smaller however have a better view. We went with the better view. The ocean view rooms are truly ocean view. The whole resort is beautiful and clean. We mostly stayed in the Royal Service area. At night we walked to the main pyramid 3 where all the restaurants and entertainment are located. It is very easy to walk around the resort and the walk from pyramid 5 to 3 only takes 5 min. The Royal service area has its own quiet beautiful lounge area. There is a very tasty food buffet all day with drinks and good coffee and teas. All food on the resort is very good. Bana was our favorite we ate there 3 out of 7 days. Bana is a sushi and sea food restaurant located right in the middle of the hotel. The private check in is excellent. A butler accompanied us to the royal service area no need to worry they is no time share involved in this process. The staff at the Royal Service are excellent. Juan Carlos head butler will meet all your needs with his excellent professional service. Our Personal butlers Juan Jose and Rodrigo provided kind excellent personalized service. Our room was decorated with balloons rose pedal bath and a special cake for my birthday. We even met the Royal service manager and asked us if our stay was going well. Royal serve pool Baile beds and pool side restaurant are great. Food is very very good. At time of check out Host Butler Gerardo walked us to the main lobby to ensure our transportation had arrived and stayed with luggage until it got on the van. Wow great service from beginning to end.

My boyfriend and I decided to visit Paradisus Cancun after much research. We read tonnes of reviews and the only thing I was slightly worried about was whether or not to book Royal Service. In the end we decided to wait until we got there and we are so glad we did because paying the extra 100 per day was not necessary. The hotel itself is gorgeous the main pyramid is full of plants and ponds which makes for a great atmosphere. It also smells amazing. Our room was in the 4th Pyramid on the top floor. We had a lagoon view which we loved. Many reviews mentioned upgrading to an ocean view but the sunsets over the lagoon were second to none. The room was spacious but not huge. There was not any furniture on the balcony but we did not find this a problem as we took our chairs from the room outside and sat on those which still left a sofa indoors to sit on. The maid service was good and they never came in the mornings when we were still in the room which was convenient. The only problem was that they did not seem to sweep very well and our room floor was always slightly sandy bitty. The mini bar was re stocked every day and we were allowed extra when we asked for it. We also got a turn down service on approximately half of the nights we were there which was an added bonus as this comes with the Royal Service package which we did not upgrade to. The pool areas were great. We read in reviews that it was hard to get beds and that everyone reserved them early but we had no trouble at all. Every single day we easily got beds with umbrellas and tables even when we went down late 11 am. Before the holiday we had planned to treat ourselves to bali beds but this was not necessary at all as the standard sunbeds were great. At times we found the main pool with the bar a bit loud as they had club music on and polside entertainment which was nice but sometimes we went to the smaller pool for more peace. We found that tipping gets you very far at Paradisus. We tipped the waiting stuff at the pool when they got us our first drink and they continued to serve us promptly for the entire day. Hector was incredible and worked relentlessly to serve us in the heat. It is WELL WORTH tipping because it gets you Royal Service for a fraction of the price and the staff really do deserve it. Hector was so kind he remembered which drinks we liked and if we were swimming when he got back from the bar he would bring our drinks to the side of the pool so we did not even have to get out. He brought us snacks from the snack bar too. Another AMAZING member of staff that deserves a huge mention is Ernesto. He mainly worked in the Bar in Bana Sushi restaurant and the service he provided was amazing. We drank at the bar nearly every evening because he made the most amazing cocktails ever. We loved chatting to him and were genuinely sad to say goodbye to him. The food was really good at the hotel. Unfortunately La Perla was closed for refurbishment. But personal favourites were Fuego Peruvian and Bana Sushi. The chicken teriyaki sushi was incredible. Market Grill was so yummy in the evenings and the waiters keep bringing different meats round until you asked them to stop. The steak was cooked to perfection. We visited twice because we loved it so much. We did not eat in Naos the buffet restaurant in the evenings because it is where we ate breakfast each day and it lacked atmosphere and the holiday feel in the evenings. Market grill was a lunch favourite the burritos and calzone are great. We read in reviews that the food was not hot in any of the restaurants but this was not the case for us at all. We also had no problems making reservations. Breakfast was okay it is better to go down to Naos either earlier or later. It is incredibly busy between 8 am and 930am. There is a good selection of food but it is standard buffet style and this let the hotel down. It also takes a very long time to get service for tea coffee and condiments. Breakfast is one of the reasons I am giving 4 stars rather than 5. One day about half way through our 12 day holiday I returned to the room to find the aircon had broken. Disaster in 32 degree heat. It took us so long to talk to reception and try and get them to fix it. They offered us a new room but we really did not want to pack all our things and move to a room in the main pyramid on a lower floor as we were worried about the noise and the view was not as good so we saw it as a downgrade. In the end the aircon got fixed and we got 2x 100 massages and late checkout for free. Kind of worth it. but it took about 4 hours to come to this resolution which really disappointed us. On this note the aircon was also VERY loud so we had to decide between disturbed sleep from the noise or turn it off and have disturbed sleep from the heat. This is another area where the hotel loses points. Whilst on the subject some building work started in our pyramid a few days in to our stay and the builders were very noisy banging and knocking down a small wall. It did not bother us too much as the sound of our loud aircon drowned it out. but if we were in a room any closer we would have been incredibly annoyed. The hotel entertainment was not bad and we visited the club one evening which was fun. As a young couple it did not really matter as we spent the evenings eating and drinking or going in to Cancun CocoBongos. so we always had lots to do. However I can see that for families who do not want to leave the resort it would be a little bit limited. We did amazing activities provided by Virgin such as the Virgin Ahoy tour where we got to swim with dolphins manatees and nurse sharks and a Romantic Lobster Cruise which was just great. We also did the Aquatours Jungle Tour which we booked at the towel hut in the resort. Well worth doing and just a short walk across the road. We had no concerns about safety in Cancun despite what people had told us before hand. We even went right in to downtown Cancun and never felt unsafe. One evening my partner was taking photos on the beach and was offered drugs to buy from a random man so watch out for that. Although he did leave as soon as he realised we were not interested. We were also NEVER harased about timeshares we we read is common. The ocean was gorgeous but very rough. The waves can change size very quickly so you have to be very careful. If I had children then there is NO WAY I would let them anywhere near it. At times there was also a lot of seaweed which gave us both a disgusting rash over our whole bodies and would not go for the rest of the holiday. Obviously this is not the hotels fault but worth looking out for. Overall we had a fantastic time and would recommend the hotel. It was a little big and busy for our taste but the food was great and the pools and beach were great. The staff were fantastic and we did some fun activities. It was not super luxurious so I would not recommend for a honeymoon etc but for a general summer holiday it is awesome.

Beautiful Beach Amazing Resort Great Pools Awesome Service. We went with 3 families each with 2 kids for 5 nights. Most of the kids were less than 5 years old. We are vegetarians. We notified the resort about our restrictions and requests prior to arrival. Best part of the resort The shows in the evenings are great. The seating could be better but we always found a spot for the whole family and after the shows were done we would hang out on the couches. There are plenty free ones. The dinner reservations at BANA was absolutely amazing and the executive chef went out of his way to make an amazing full vegetarian dinner. That was our last dinner before we left and a memorable one for sure. Other restaurants that we enjoyed a lot were Blue Agave Market Grill for breakfast lunch. Cocos bar was our hangout spot. Baby Club Sitter. Since most of our kids were less than 5 we dropped them at baby club for naps and it was very comfortable. They had clean cribs with clean and new stuff animals. My kids loved it. They slept in the crib for atleast 25 hours while we hung out at the awesome Cocos beach front bar. We also got a private sitter the last night and it was reasonably priced and the lady was super sweet. Service is a key for us to make the experience great and it was amazing throughout the resort. Starting with easy check in and we got an amazing ocean front rooms on the top floor. We asked to be in the main building since we wanted to be close to everything. We did n\u2019t have any issues with noise. One evening the lady did sing until late 10 pm and we could hear slightly but since she was so great we did n\u2019t mind it. We ventured outside one day and realized that we had the best resort in town with largest beach front. Also we did n\u2019t have any challenges getting the huts in the morning. They are for free and right on the beach. I think Paradisus was the only resort that had those huts. Pools \u2013 Pools were great and the kids loved the kiddy pool. We also loved the swim up bar. We mainly stayed in the 5 ft pool. I do think a 4 ft pool would be a great addition to your resort. The pools are huge and we never felt like it was too crowded. Food wise \u2013. It \u2019s tough to cater to vegetarians but since we had told the staff in advance they made the best effort to accommodate us. Breakfast was one of our favorite meals with tons of fresh fruits great pastries fresh guacamole and vegetable omelets. All of this with the beautiful view of the beach. Oatmeal can be improved. It was really watery. We will definitely come back.

Kids Club 41. After visiting Cancun several times before and loving it my husband and I did good amount of homework before deciding where to bring the kids ages 2 5 for the week being we usually go to the Bahamas or cruises and thought we would chose this place so our kids can get a view of Mexican culture etc. but unfortunately heres the real deal. So for starters the beach itself we are from Miami Beach. and I am wondering why In the world I came to this hotel with a beach this rough and full of seaweed. Crazy huhNext good luck finding chairs by the pool or beach with any shade these are all reserved for the Melia group people or 50 a bed per day you may be lucky. crazy toBreakfast Prepare yourself to be in a crowded mission impossible type setting lines for omelettes waiters running around like mad men its insane how crowded and so they say they are not even in high season in end of June imagine later on and its the only restaurant available at breakfast which is the Naos buffet. They do however have another location for breakfast again reserved for Melia something guests and the infamous timeshare sales men with their victims. These timeshare people will catch you without you even noticing. they are dressed in white and will begin to explain the hotel locations etc and before you know it you are setting up your meeting for the following morning to get a spa treatment which I must admit was nice timeshare 90 min is not true though they will go over the 90 min and there went your morning in timeshare talks. Next so there are plenty of restaurants which I would say is probably the only thing really deserving of this hotel I was thinking initially. ok great there s tons of options for my husband and I while kids are at kids club. think againYou have to make reservations at least a day in advance and alot of them are already booked. Kids club heres the real 41. there is the baby club ages 1 4 mostly cribs and a sitter maybe holding a baby and then like a 3 year old doing a drawing on the floor not very exciting for my kids when they saw it. and then a separate Kids Club ages 5 12 with a bounce house that was never inflated everytime we walked by. let me be completely honest. every kids club including the one on a Cruise my kids jump for joy here they wanted nothing to do with it due to how boring it looked each time we went by. Next the kids pool BORING. just a 2 ft pool with all the parents all complaining of there being not enough chairs how the food in the hotel is not kid friendly AT ALL. how PARADISUS LA ESMERALDA is ten times better. I m thinking crap. I should have gone there but instead i m here booking tours to get out of this hotel with a rough beach not kid friendly pool and then what else is left to do but eat. and the food is not kid friendly either THIS IS NOT A KID FRIENDLY HOTEL EVEN ROOM SERVICE TO BRING WARM MILK EACH DAY WAS OVER 50 MINUTES by then kids were aslepThey even run out of cereal Pizza maker was broken the whole time we were there. First afternoon we went to the beach we came back by 5 pm and room had not been done from previous day. this was just the icing on the cake when I headed down to guest services and had to be on a hunt down for either Mr Sergio ABRAHAM which I met on my way out but unfortunately was too late asked for my email and I still have not heard back from him. ENTERTAINMENT. Absurd setting. You would think that a hotel with 80 rooms would have a decent setting to have the night show. This is located in the cocktail lounge bar area with Bali beds and so people sitting on floor etc to see these 30 minute shows and since there is nowhere to walk to nearby you can go ahead and call it a night because the KIDS CLUB CLOSES at 845 anyway so forget the rest there is nothing else to do for a family after that. Service was decent. There was one waiter an older gentleman named RIGOBERTO was the best at the Blue Agave restaurant the rest seemed very overworked and running around. Sergio at Guest Services heard out my concerns but seems like he could not do much other than help out with a late checkout after I had been talking to him over 2 hours. Lastly on my way out of this stressful hotel I decide to go get an espresso after lunch and guess what. No espresso available until after 4 pm and I look at clock and its 430 and they say sorry will be another 30 minutes until machine is ready. really. I m not an idiot i own Nespreso machine at home it takes 30 seconds. In a nutshell if you have the luck of reading this do yourself a favor if you are traveling with kids and go elsewhere or try the Paradisus Esmeralda maybe that is a better shot. I have stayed in Paradisus Punta Cana and remember it being great I ca nt say the same about Cancun unfortunately. It really made us sad that our best memories of this family vacation was when we went to XCARET Captain Hook Pirate show my kids loved it. Wifi is very poor unles you are standing in front of main lobby and those resort credits. JOKEthey are small coupon booklet with 10 off here and there all over priced items. The Paradisus Brand. really let us down this time. We wish things could of been different even considered the timeshare. but this just killed the deal.", "offset": [573, 735], "date": "2015-07-01", "cpt": "1", "category": "pool"}, {"id": 14, "uid": "5c701403-684e-4d5e-b458-0a083e7739c2", "sentence": "The Best Vacation Ever Pure Paradise. After a 4 hour flight Me and my family arrived at the Paradisus. At the front door a lady already had our reservation and she directed us to the VIP family concierge lounge. In the lounge it had food drinks comfy couches and a kids play area. We met Ricardo who was super nice and friendly. He explained detail by detail about our stay. After that he introduced us to our personal Butler. yes a Butler how cool is that. Our Butler \u2019s name was MAURO. Mauro was also super nice cool and friendly he took care of us from the day we got there to the day we had to leave. He showed us around the resort on where the restaurants and other services where located that was really cool to know cause the place is massive. Then he guided us to our rooms and showed us all of the room amenities my kids had their own personal kids bathrobes slippers backpacks towels and sand toys that was awesome. We also had mini bar fully stocked with drinks and snacks. The room and bathroom put together were big and spacious. Now for the winner we had a private balcony with a spectacular beautiful blue oceanfront view picture perfect. The outstanding view made my vacation I will never forget this place is Amazing Awesome. Another thing that got my attention was our butler Mauro was really nice and friendly to my kids. After a long day at the beach pool or sightseeing Mauro would leave a nice letter at the end of a day for us that came with a gift or surprise in our hotel room. For instance my kids received a letter attached with two bags of fish food with a cute riddle which they could feed the koi fish at the pond in the resort at Bana or Vento My kids eyes lit up with Joy. Another was Mauro wrote another cute riddle letter for my kids about having a bubble bath with friendly creatures from the sea it turned out that he decorated the bathtub with a bunch of balloons shaped of fishes and octopuses My kids were so happy it left me and my wife with smile like any parent would say if the kids are happy we are happy. Also I ca n\u2019t forget the first day Mauro brought me a Welcome bottle of Tequila hey why not you in Mexico It \u2019s Tequila Nation but to many Tequila will get you. Mauro also reserved Bali Beds for us at the pool for our entire stay which was a great idea. People I strongly suggest you to book the Bali beds at the pool so you and your family could feel comfortable. I say this because people wake up early in the morning like 6 7am and claim pool chairs around to pool by setting their towels or stuff on it. I find this really stupid and suggest Paradisus executives fix this problem. I \u2019m from the US there is a word called \u201c Courtesy \u201d we use but it looks like people are selfish when it comes to pool chairs. I talked to workers around there and they told me they are no rules for claiming chairs that you could personally remove their towels stuff if they do n\u2019t return or see anybody there after 25 minutes. So just beware people when you head to the pool. Another note to all the swim up bar area could get rowdy and wild with people that do n\u2019t know how to handle their liquor. So keep in mind to have your kids at a distance from it or stay at the kidie pool area by La Perla Restaurant. The beach area was wide and plenty of beach lounge chairs available for the family plus there is a bar on the beach and waiters serving you drinks on the beach every second that was AWESOME. As for Housekeeping Angelica was awesome she kept our room super clean and mini bar fully stocked she also decorated my kids bed with their toys and blankets she was a sweetheart she was the best. Now for the food my best personal favorite was \u201c Blueagave \u201d delicious all the way the waiter recommended me to have a drink call Tres Generaciones \u201d with the meal at first I was skeptical but this drink bursts the juicy flavors of the tacos right on your tongue YUMMY Pure Delicious and Pure Heaven. The rest of the restaurants were good for the most part. Moreover currency exchange could be a problem. At the resort \u2019s front desk by the right side of the entrance had me bouncing back and forth to a different location to get money it was really unorganized. Also all the ATMs in the resort were out of service all the time. Exchanging US to Pesos could get complicated after a while. I ran into many people encountering the same issue about money getting the exchange or making money change. I advise my fellow Americans to download a currency calculator ap on your smartphone so you will not get tricked on overcharge services or products. Next time I \u2019m going to roll in with stack bundles of 1 bills instead of 20 \u2019s it makes life much easier. On the other hand my stay at the Paradisus was Amazing a vacation that I will always remember the best vacation ever. I thought one week was enough at first but once I got back home I should have done Two weeks. I highly recommend this resort for families that have little ones and large families and book the Family Concierge. I \u2019l return if I get the same room it was perfect. Anyways Thank You Ricardo family concierge. Thank You Mauro family concierge Butler. Thank You Angelica housekeeping. Thank You Paradisus staff and lastly Thank You CANCUN MEXICO it \u2019s been real.

We were a group of four. A mom and three adult children. 2 of us checked in on Friday and the other two checked in the following day Saturday. I was part of the Friday check in team and the person paying for this entire experience. When I reserved the rooms we asked for two double beds in each room and for the rooms to adjoin. We were told that nothing could be guaranteed and the info would be placed in our reservation notes. We got the beds but the rooms did not adjourn. There was a room that separated us. Of course we assumed that room was booked. We find out later that a couple checked in on Sunday. That was disappointing. Not the hotels fault at all but it rained for 25 days of our trip. The rain non stop and so was the wind. The hotel had towels all over because in most areas of the hotel rain was seeping in very quickly. As you can imagine resources were used to address the rain and maintain the property. The Excellent Our butler Hervik. If you opt to stay at this property and I do recommend it just not during rainy season you must get Royal Service. Hervik was amazing and did everything he could to make our stay enjoyable. Even though it rained he put the sunshine back into our trip. Also the people who played music hosted games and kept kids and adults entertained during the rain and wind storm deserve so much credit. The Good Average The food. The food is plentiful and there is good variety. You will not go hungry and you will not be bored. I do think their is an opportunity to keep the food at a higher temperature. I also thought the salad in the Brazilian steak house was incredibly unimaginative. I \u2019m not kidding a 5 year old chef could do better. This may seem petty but when the focal point is meat and its good you want the sides to stand up to the meat not by wimpy and die. The sides are below average. However the Mexican restaurant is truly WONDERFUL. Everything all four of us ordered was mouth watering delicious and the service was beautiful. Our rooms were spacious. Jr Suite Ocean View and they were always cleaned on time and we were provided with turndown service and in Royal Service you have ulimited access to premium alchohol wonderful selections of coffees and teas and really good espresso \u2019s. We also had pillow service and the lavender on the pillow is unreal. I slept like a baby. The major kinks are trying to secure finer details with Melia and how that translates to the property staff. The food can be at times boring and unimaginative and not very hot. There was nothing BAD about my experience except the weather and that is no ones fault. Once it stopped raining we enjoyed the Bali beds we walked along the ocean and we got in the pool. This is an awesome place. Again I have to recommend the Royal Service.

We returned here for our second year in a row. The experience overall was different as last time we were with a large group and this time it was just our family 2 adults and 2 kids 10 16Check in was great with Oscar coming to offer us drinks. Our room was exactly as last year only facing the lagoon instead of the ocean but that is what we paid for. The room itself is okay nothing special not like the Paradisus in Playa Del Carmen. The maid did a fairly decent job but never left us enough towels. Every day we had to call and request another towel. The washcloths were left periodically. The ice machines rarely had ice so we had to call for ice. Everything we needed we called to get and they did respond fairly quick. We ate at every restaurant except Mole. La Palapa. the steakhouse. the steaks are not good they are very tough and fatty. Bana we did not care for it at all but we are not real fond of Asian food anyway. Market Grill the Brazilian meat place it was a lot of meat coming at you real fast. Some cuts were better than others but they did not even bring vegetables and other sides until we had all the meats. It would have been nice if they would have brought the meat and then came with the sides then the rest of the meat. During the day we liked the Market Grill for lunch as you can order from a menu which has several different items to choose from. We had Ricardo several times as our server and were very pleased with his service. Love the shrimp skewers and the arugula salad. The taco place was fairly decent. Vento was okay. I was disappointed in Fuego this year I thought it was not so great. The buffet well it is a buffet by the end of the stay I really did not care to go in there any longer especially for breakfast. We did order room service for breakfast a few times it was not bad. They also have a place near the pool that serves some hamburgers hot dogs wings sandwiches and salads. It was alright but you have all the guests getting out of the pool no hand washing and touching the utensils etc. That stuff bothers me probably why I do not like the buffet. The main pool has the pool bar and of course by mid afternoon it is packed with people that are there for hours never leaving. The pool got very warm toward the end of the day. Plus people were getting food and getting in the pool to eat I am not sure why one would do this. it is pretty gross. We had a hard time getting service at the pool bar the few times we went over there. We are good tippers so it was kind of discouraging as they seemed to ignore us. The beach is very nice even though we were there with the seaweed it was still nice. There were a few days we were able to get in the ocean as the seaweed seemed to have cleared out for a bit. The service at the beach was not as great as last year. After a few days we did seem to build a relationship with Laticia and she ended up taking care of us. the better we tipped the better the serviceCocos Bar we went to several nights mainly to get a drink to take down to the beach where we waited for the sea turtles to come in and lay eggs. Again we felt a little ignored by a few of the bar tenders down here. Toward the end of the trip though it did improve. The Avenue Bar is okay for an evening drink but nothing for the kids here. They do have the show but we were there for 9 nights and could never begin to see the show at all. The night club we went in got a drink and left. They have a fog machine going I guess were too old for that. Entertainment in the evenings is not great. it is very hard for kids in the evening as they really have nothing to offer unles you upgrade which we did not. We asked to use the pool table and nobody was in the family concierge where it is located and of course we could not use it. There is no ping pong tables no games nothing for the kids at night.

My boyfriend and I just came back from our 5 night stay at paradisus and loved every minute of it. We were upgraded to the royal service which made our stay that much more enjoyable. The royal service pool is the adults only pool which was very relaxing although they do not have a swim up bar but I heard they will be building one there next month. At the royal service pool you can reserve a bali bed at no additional charge. The beds are very comfortable and provide nice shade from the cancun sun. As far as waiters go in the royal pool Victor was by far the best one. When he brought us our first drink of the day we tipped him and he treated us like royalty the rest of the day. Moises was also good but Victor was much more attentive. In the pool bar the bartenders Emanuel and manager Simon were awesome. They kept the drinks coming and were very pleasant. We also saw Emanuel working one night in the Avenue bar. My boyfriend likes his long island ice teas with muddled fruit and when they ran out of oranges Emanuel went searching for them and came back with several and a huge smile on his face. The pool bar was very nice however kids are allowed in there and were even sitting at the bar stools in the pool. They also were playing right next to the pool bar and constantly splashing pool wate in our drinks. I understand they are kids being kids but I think the hotel should reserve the pool bar for adults only. At the Avenue bar at night see ernesto. Best bartender in there although Francisco Pancho was very good too. Ernesto was always smiling and happy to be there. We will definitely come back to see our favorites at the resort. Victor the waiter in the royal service Emanuel in the pool bar and ernesto at the Avenue bar. Our butler Juan was very accommodating as well. He set up all our dinner reservations and a late check out with a changing room. Market grill the brasilian steakhouse was the best dinner restaurant we tried. The food was so good and the waiters will keep bringing out more food. La palapa the royal service was nice too but had a very limited menu. The restaurant is high end so the portions are small. My bf left there still hungry so we went to the buffet Nao which was always very delicious. Nice omletes made to order for breakfast in Nao. Blue agave is good too. it is basically a taco bar but the quality of the meat was very good. Go to Mole the Mexican restaurant for authentic mexican food. La perla restaurant was okay but not one of our favorites. We will definitely come back to this resort and recommend it to my parents who are already looking into booking their stay.

Check in was a breeze we were immediately escorted to the royal service side where we were offered a drink. Our bags were brought to our room we did not have to carry them. There were a few hiccups shortly after we arrived but SANDRA did an amazing job fixing them. LETICIA ROSAS was also such a sweetheart and was very helpful. Market grill and Bana were our favorite restaurants we wish we would have reserved Bana another day after eating there. Our server Eduardo was a pleasure. We strongly disliked MOLE we did not finish any of our food we left and went over to the buffet. The best part of our trip was lounging by the pool and beach area. We would order food and drinks from there. We walked over to the other side and were so glad we chose Royal service. It was crowded and loud. There was ALWAYS chairs to sit on at the Royal service side. We loved laying on our Bali beds. We fell asleep out there a few times. EDIE hope I am spelling his name right was EXCELLENT. He made sure we had cold bottled water and made sure we got everything we asked for he was truly amazing and was so pleasant. JORGE was AWESOME too we were completely satisfied with his service by the pool he went above and beyond to make sure we were good. can not forget ALEJANDRO if it were not for these men by the pool our trip would NOT have been so good. They really made our time by the pool hotel great. CARLOS FARAROL was also very helpful extremely satisfied with his service. Our room was cleaned well and our bed turned down at night. They make sure you do not lift a finger at this place. The spa was amazing and the hydrotherapy was so relaxing. Okay my only negatives are that certain areas in the hotel are very warm and the room may not be as cool as some may want it. The pool water is also warm but we still enjoyed relaxing in it daily. The beach did have seaweed but we still had so much fun in the water. The hotel was a little dark however I thought it was calming and relaxing. HELPFUL TIP if by 11 am no one claims their Bali bed you can get it just ask to be placed on a waiting list. We had a Bali bed every day of our trip because of this.

I arrived at the hotel just after dark. It looked beautiful from the outside. Almost surreal. The hotel consists of five interconnected pyramids with the top of the pyramids being transparent. We were met by an upbeat doorman who announced loudly \u201c Welcome to the best hotel in the world \u201d. Check in was quick and easy. My lagoon view room was large with a separate sitting area a large balcony and very well lit. I liked that. None of that depressing mood lighting designed to save energy. There was no carpeting as in many hotels located on the beach. The bell boy brought my bag within ten minutes of entering my room. The bathroom was large and had a separate area separated by a sliding door for the toilet bowl and bidet. I noticed that there were holes on the wall next to the toilet where there would ordinarily be a phone installed. Did n\u2019t pay much attention to that and fell asleep that evening. In the morning I noticed that at two places in the bathroom and one in the entrance area there was a steady but tiny dripping of water. The kind that might come from excessive condensation on an air conditioning duct. I also noticed that the wall next to the toilet was moist as if water had flowed down at night. The next morning went down for breakfast at 8 am. Informed the concierge that there was water leaking from the roof. Came up 9 am later to get some money from my safe only to discover that there was a water showering down from the roof of the bathroom and entrance area in what could only be described as a waterfall. It was also cascading down from the wall next to the toilet. And my room was FLOODED with over a centimeter of water and water was overflowing into the corridor. There were three persons from housekeeping trying to dry it and another three from maintenance trying to patch the leak. They had been sensible enough to pick my bags dirty clothes and shoes from the floor and placed them on the table to prevent them from being ruined. I left hurriedly as they seemed to be confident of fixing it. Two hours later the leak had slowed but water was still dripping. Again they told me that they would fix it. Another two hours later I realized that there was no way that it was going to get fixed. It seemed to be an old problem. That is why I suspect the phone next to the toilet had been removed as the water must have short circuited it previously. I then went to the front desk and complained. They did n\u2019t seem to have any idea that this was going on. Or at least they pretended not to know. By now I was upset as I had to be at a meeting in one hour and needed to change. They had as yet no plans of moving me. They really expected me to stay in the flooded room. It was only when I got upset and demanded to be moved and to be upgraded as compensation did they even acknowledge that there was a problem. Accidents do happen. I get that. But in this case the room had an old problem that had not been fixed. And they knew that. Or at least should have known that. Their \u2018 crime \u2019 was that they waited for me to lose it before giving me another room. They really should \u2019ve been all over me apologizing for the inconvenience. After all they did claim to be the best hotel in the worldWel they did give me another room. And upgraded me to an ocean view room. Which saved them from a really sucky review because the ocean view rooms are absolutely spectacular. Watching the turquoise shallow water blend into the deeper aquamarine colour of the ocean is a sight that is worth any amount of money. In all fairness to the hotel the d\u00e9cor in the central atrium takes your breath away. The vertical hanging garden is beautiful. As is the jungle created in the central atrium. My suggestion is to eat in the restaurant located in the central atrium as it is akin to eating in the middle of a rain forest. True it has a lesser variety of food but the experience more than makes up for that. Also it does not have the same mad rush the main restaurant does. All the restaurants served good food. We even ate at their fine dining restaurant an extremely pleasant experience though pricey. At peak times it could take some time to find a table in their main restaurants. The hotel grounds are beautiful as are the swimming pools and beaches. I found it unusual that though there were red flags on the beach indicating the beach was closed there were a number of people swimming along the entire beach. One day a young lady swam out too far and could not get back. Almost immediately a life guard went in after her then another then a third and a fourth. Finally a fifth life guard on a jet ski from a neighboring hotel got them all out by towing them back. This made me feel safe and realized that the hotel and its neighbors had a good team of life guard professionals. The bottom line By all means stay here. You wo n\u2019t regret it. And definitely upgrade to a sea view room. This is a fabulous hotel which has one room that floods.

We just returned from a five night stay at the Paradisus Cancun and would like to report that it was fabulous. We stayed in a Family Concierge Oceanview Suite on the sixth top floor of Pyramid 5 and were extremely happy with it. The first room contained a king sized bed a full bathroom and balcony with Jacuzi tub and the second room contained a kitchenette sofa bed full bathroom and balcony. More room than the three of us needed but our seven year old son enjoyed having his \u201c own \u201d room. The suite was clean and the small fridge was stocked every day with more snacks and drinks than we could possibly eat drink. We never heard a peep from any of our neighbors and we thoroughly enjoyed the wonderful view and sound of the ocean. As part of the Family Concierge program we were assigned a team of two butlers \u2013 Alexander and Josue. We did n\u2019t really have any problems that required their services but I \u2019m confident that they would have been able to resolve any issues that came up. We primarily dealt with Alexander who was outstanding. He provided us with an overview of the hotel booked our dinner reservations checked in with us and even came down to the pool to visit us to make sure we did n\u2019t need anything and arranged for some gifts surprises for our son. I \u2019d highly recommend the FC program. the FC check in and lounge is a very nice touch and I know we will be requesting Alexander again when we return. We also spoiled ourselves by renting a polside bed cabana each day. It provided a very comfortable resting spot as we tag teamed playing in the pool with our son \u2013 who would have stayed in the pool 24 hours a day if he could. The pool service was equally as good especially Jesus who took incredible care of us. We never wanted for food or drink while at the pool and Jesus always made sure our bucket was full of ice and bottles of water. The restaurants were good and we enjoyed each meal we had. There was a wide variety of offerings at the breakfast buffet and lunches from the Sunset Grill were very good. And if you rent a bed cabana be sure to ask Jesus about the lobster lunch feast \u2026 VERY nice. Dinners were also very good. We opted for tapas at Vento tacos and quesadillas at Blue Agave and Brazilian Rodizio at Market Grill twice. Ca n\u2019t say we had a bad meal. Drinks were not watered down and were tasty and our son very much enjoyed having a Nada Colada at the swim up bar each day. In summary it was an extremely nice and relaxing vacation. I \u2019m struggling to find anything negative to say about our stay. I suppose if I had to write something \u201c negative \u201d it would be that the light switches in the rooms are very confusing. It actually became a bit of joke between the three of us \u2013 trying to figure out how to turn on say the ceiling fan. Many switches did n\u2019t seem to control anything and for some fixtures it seemed like just the right combination of on off switches was needed to make things work. But seriously we got more laughs out of that than any frustration. The resort was great and the staff was even greater. Not only did Alexander and Jesus make sure that we were taken care of they did it in such a way as to making us feel very welcome \u2013 almost like family. And everyone else we interacted with was professional and warm. I highly recommend this resort and we will be doing to our friends and family.

There were life guards constantly walking around which was reassuring to see. This is not a swimable beach area. Not the hotels fault but take note of this if your looking for a beach to sit in this is not it. The towel game is in full force.
