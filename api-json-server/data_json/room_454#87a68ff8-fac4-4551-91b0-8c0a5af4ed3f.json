The location one block inland from Fishermans Wharf is excellent. it is also just a short walk to the Pier from which the Alcatraz ferries depart. The troleycar runs a block away and the cable car is only 2 or 3 blocks away. FabulousOur room was quiet and airy the bathroom well equipped and they even brought me a kettle as being English. I like my tea in the mornings there is already a filter coffee machine in the room with daily replenishment of the coffee pouches. If there is a slight downside the tea selection they gave me was not refreshed I know I could have asked but I already had some tea of my own and nor was any milk provided again I could have asked but I had already bought some anyway just in case but really that is all I could find fault about. if you could call it a faultWine lovers will enjoy the daily free wine evening hosted by the hotel from 170 to 180.

The room had two double beds had to use one for storage of clothes as the room was lacking space there was one tiny wardrobe which also accommodated the safe. There was a one set of draws and table that really wasted space another set of draws here would be better especially if four sharing. The room has snacks and drinks you can purchase. Also coffee making machine. Bathroom was clean and a good size with usual towels and toiletries. The air con unit can be a little noisy and during the night you can hear other peoples even though we where on the quiet size of hotel which meant away from traffic with no view other than other windows. The window has shutters which where fine but the window was old and mouldy when my husband tried to shut it he had a bit of a mess on. The hotel has free coffee from about 6 am till 10 am each morning and a complimentary wine hour 5 6pm each evening with pizza this is very popular and great way to meet other people.

The location is great and convenient to many sites and attractions. However it \u2019s a step above a Holiday Inn at best. As a former Hotel executive this hotel fell far short of the price paid. To summarize what our issues were1. Customer service was well below what I would expect at a hotel with these prices. Check in was terribly long and the desk agent told me I could n\u2019t check in without giving my email. I typically do n\u2019t give it out. Check out was a very long process with a long line and minimal agents. Check out took about 20 minutes. One night I wanted to ask what time check out was and the desk agent was chatting on the phone about someone with work. Another guest was even waiting for help. I had to interrupt her from a conversation I could hear that was not pertinent to anything relating to the two guests she had right in front of her. She looked at me like I was the rude person. If a guest is in front of you help them. That \u2019s hotel 101. This is why an agent tells you to \u201c hold please \u201d when you call a hotel. 2. The room was like a shoebox. We had two large suitcase and we could n\u2019t even place them anywhere it did n\u2019t impede our walk path. Additionally the closet was extremely tiny and there were n\u2019t any luggage stands. However there was a light over the table that took up 10 of the room which was never used by us. I ca nt even imagine anyone using it it was so large and cumbersome3. A few issues with the room in general. Our bathroom exhaust did n\u2019t work so we told the desk. The maintenance person fixed it but it would n\u2019t turn off. There was n\u2019t any specific switch for it to turn on or off so it just ran 247. 4. One morning housekeeping just walk in the room while we were still in bed. No knock no announcing nothing. Just walked tight in. 5. Hot water was an issue often times we had a cold to luke warm shower. 6. It was rather chilly while we visited and we could n\u2019t get our heat to work properly. We would set it and it would either be to cold or to hot. When we set it at 68 the room would get up to 77 degrees. With a setting of 65 it would get to about 69. We could n\u2019t find a happy medium so we would turn it on and off during the nights. 7. We tried to have drinks in the restaurant one night and it was a bit chilly. The heat did n\u2019t seem like it was heating the restaurant that well. We actually left early because the metal bar stools were so cold to sit on that we could n\u2019t take it any longer. We were so disappointed with the customer service we received that we did n\u2019t even tell anyone. We were trying to have a romantic getaway as a couple and did n\u2019t want all these things to take away from our experience. But to summarize our stay it was not good at all. I thoroughly believe a Holiday Inn would have been a better choice overall and would have saved us some cash. I do n\u2019t mind spending 1000 to say for 4 nights in a nice hotel but this place is not worth it. I will say that the hotel is very clean and well maintained.

Our biggest complaint about the room would be the lack of storage we had 1 full size drawer 2 half size drawers and a tiny coffin like closet for 2 people staying 4 nights. This was not enough space for us and there was also not enough space to just leave your things in the suitcase because there was not enough space in the room to be moving them around and opening them up frequently. We had no view to speak of. we looked out onto the roof top and walls of another building. However the benefit of this was we were not near the street and we found our room surprisingly quiet for a city hotel we were never disturbed by street noise other guests or even the cleaning staff in the hallway in the morning. The lobby is cute and we liked the little bar so we could sit by the fire in the evening and have a drink.
