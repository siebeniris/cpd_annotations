I stayed for 5 days at the JW Mariot while my daughter competed in a volleyball tournament. The location of the hotel is absolutely ideal. Close enough to the French Quarter for the restaurants and entertainment but not too close that you can not sleep from all the chaos. The room was well appointed very clean and the beds quite comfortable. The staff at the front desk and throughout the hotel was always extremely helpful and friendly no matter whether it was 8 pm or 6 am time change had us up rather early. As Gold level members we were very fortunate to enjoy the breakfast and happy hour in the Concierge room. The breakfast was the best I have ever had at in a concierge room with offering for many dietary needs. The coffee was not so good though but Starbucks is less than a block away. The Happy hour hors doeuvres were delicious and helped to quell our hunger after a long day. My only complaint was the day that we checked out it took 35 minutes to get our car out of the valet and there was great confusion about the parking charge not being on our bill which required us waiting another 10 minutes while the attendant sorted it out. I came very close to missing my daughters first game on the last day. Never the less the next time we return to NOLA I will most definitely look into returning to this hotel.", "offset": [36, 127], "date": "2015-06-27", "cpt": "0", "category": "fitness"}, {"id": 2, "uid": "7f55848a-1a64-48ad-8d28-4bfc2d5439e1", "sentence": "Great spot for business or family.

With many hotels in the New Orleans area the JW Mariot stands out from the rest. Stayed here while in NOLA for business. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay as the service hotel and amenities were superb.

The concierge lounge for platinum guests was well staffed and various offerings in the evening as well as for breakfast.

I thought that since I reserved this room through the Priceline Mystery deal and got it for a song we might not be treated quite as well as if we had paid more. I was so mistaken. From the moment we check in we were given top notch treatment by the entire staff. And our housekeeper Lidia was the best. Kept our room so clean and every day she left us animals from hand towels washcloths. Nice room with a view on the 19th floor. Street cars right out the front door and within steps of coffee shops restaurants drugstores and the French Quarter. There is a computer and printer for printing boarding passes. We asked if there was a place for us to pop our microwave popcorn and they had a microwave brought to our room in a matter of minutes. There is a fridge and safe in the room. We had no issues of any sort. At our request they even weighed our luggage before we left for our return trip home. Nice rooftop pool and exercise room. No free internet in the rooms but you canget it for free in the very comfortable and roomy lobby. We would not hesitate to stay here again. On a side note no need to rent a car in New Orleans. 36 plus tip to get from airport to hotel and around 40 night to park. We were there for 4 days and we used buses and streetcars the entire trip including buses from and back to the airport. Out entire total cost for transportation was 27 for the two of us. Yes you read right. Twenty seven dollars for 4 days. That includes round trip from back to airport and getting off and on streetcars to every single place we wanted to go including the W2 Museum French Market Commanders Palace and Port of Call for lunch. Just take the time to research the Jefferson Transit system RTA and the street cars before you go. You can even order your Jazzy Passes and have them mailed to your house before you leave. These passes give you unlimited rides on RTA and streetcars. Oh and take the ferry over to Algiers after dark to look at the New Orleans skyline all lit up. 8 minute trip over for two dollars per person each way. We did not bother to get off at Algiers as we just stayed on and admired the view.", "offset": [916, 952], "date": "2017-04-21", "cpt": "0", "category": "fitness"}, {"id": 9, "uid": "071b13a1-fbbc-4940-bee3-5b6eb842eba2", "sentence": "Exploring NOLA. This hotel is in the heart of the French Quarter. It is located on Canal Street the main entrance is in the back on Common and is diagonally across from Bourbon and Royal. The Street Cars run right across the street from you. You are within walking distance to EVERYTHING from the Riverside Mall to the Aquarium maybe 10 15 minutes on foot. there is a liquor store called Unique on Royal Street and tons of drug stores if you forget anything. The price was somewhat steep but you save so much on transportation. There were no breakfast accommodations that we knew of so do not be too expectant of that. But if you want a good breakfast be sure to stop at the Ruby Slipper Cafe on Canal and Burgandy which is down the street. there is a beautiful rooftop pool that lends a nice view of the Superdome and a nice exercise facility. It was nice a cool inside the entire facility something you are extremely grateful for while walking the humid streets.

It is not the greatest JW in the JW chain. I will start with the positives first. the Nespreso maker in the room the empty fridge not packed with mini bar items in the room the bell staff and concierge and the bar with accessibility to Canal Street for Mardi Gras. The reasons I wo n\u2019t go out of my way to stay here again. The rooms are loud you can hear the hallway and your neighbors doing everyday activities like showering snoring and raising the blinds. Sluggish AC. The tiny closets with no room to hang clothes. Not a fan of the recent remodel it looks generic and cold borderline IKEA feel. Does not reflect New Orleans culture at all. Elevators take forever on peak times. Smallish lobby that always feels packed with weird ultra modern dated couches. Breakfast options within hotel are not the best. Small gripes all in all. But now that Mariot has destroyed their elite program with Bonvoy these little things matter. I am no longer tied to staying strictly at Mariot properties.
