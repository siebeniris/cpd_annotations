Very empresed. it is hard to find and expierence customer service like that anymore.

I had the loveliest for a staycation at the Travelodge La Jola Beach. Everyone there from Will Olga and Tricia at the front desk to Florencia in housekeeping was so welcoming and professional. The rooms are very well appointed the parking is free and so is the wifi. There is coffee fruit and water at all times in the lobby and danish and bagels are added for breakfast. The jacuzi is lovely and the property is very near the beach.

This is an excellent basic motel. It does not try to be a luxurious 5 star resort. It does what it sets out to do in an outstanding manner. All staff were super. Room was clean well furnished comfortable and quiet with small refrigerator coffee maker and microwave. Free parking was a blessing close and convenient. Breakfast was as advertised a basic continental layout with juice coffee tea. Overall this is an outstanding value. I have made numerous 2 5 day business trips to La Jola and have tried different hotels. The Travelodge is by far the best value.

La Jola is a lovely area to stay in. The hotel staff were friendly and helpful. The complimentary breakfast was tasty it was bagels danishes coffee juice cereal etc. The room was comfy and clean with a separate makeup table magnified mirror so that my family could shower while I was doing my makeup for the day. something I appreciated as we were always on the go. It was a short drive to the beaches and the area is so beautiful. I think it is only about 5 minutes drive south to downtown San Diego. The breakfast though tasty was in the reception area and the only seating was one park bench outside and the pool area which was locked so you had to ask for a key. The pool looked a bit dirty on the bottom needed cleaning. We arrived early evening and did not see any restaurants and had to go for a drive to find one. These things were minor though so I would stay there again.", "offset": [185, 331], "date": "2017-05-11", "cpt": "0", "category": "family"}, {"id": 7, "uid": "c890dec3-2ba2-48c7-998c-2e9d6e98ee32", "sentence": "Not best value in town. Location ie the beach is only a 3 minutes walk away. And at least there is a real vacation atmosphere. The friendliness of the staff. The standard of the acomodation. The Travelodge is a motel with the standard of the Motel 6 category that we have visited on our honeymoon trip 33 years ago. Our apartment was a time capsule added with Wifi unstable. When entering the room 218 there was a unpleasant smell. Probably caused by the old carpet floor. The shifting window of the main room could not be opened at all blocked by screws. A bit better in the bathroom The shifting window can be opened at least half then to be limited by a screw. We tried to let fresh air in by opening the entrance door of the apartment fully or in part but with no lasting benefit. Fortunately the apartment was on the first floor. Breakfast was included but there is no breakfast room. In the reception room there are boards on the left and the right side where guests can take coffee juice milk cereals bagels croissants and few stuff for the bread peanut butter and cream chease and 1 type of jelly but no honey. Guests have to sit on banks at the outside wall of the house facing the parking cars. Fortunately the friendly staff member Tricia advised us to sit at the tables around the swimming pool where a wall seperated us from the onsite parking ground and the traffic on La Jola Blvd. But when there is no staff around nobody will show the guests this escape has happened on our second morning. With a little good will and investment things could be improved a lot.
