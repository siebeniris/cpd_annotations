We were lucky to have the sun all week with temps in the mid 80s though the water was a little chilly. Overall it was wonderful and all of us had a great time though some negatives Due to early am flights into dubai and check out around 12 you likely will not have a room until 3 or 4 even if you request early check in. Bring a bag with your familys swim stuff so you do not have to get into your checked luggage at the hotel bc that is a zoo. We stayed in the imperial club rooms which were fab and give you access to a lot of amenities covered later. but they should expand the 2 lounges because there is not enough room for everyone at breakfast tea time or for the pre dinner drinks and canap\u00e9s. We ate at Nobu which was amazing. Not amazing was seeing our waitress from Nobu working at the buffet restaurant the next morning. Overall the food was generally very good though I think the breakfast could provide more breakfast item variety there is plenty of Chinese food or Indian food available at breakfast but more continental options would be great. More cereal options for kids more and better meats and cheeses etcPositives. Restaurants were great tried Nobu and seafire ate here 2x pool side restaurants french and Italian restaurants. All but the Italian which was only so so were great. Room was amazing. Views of dubai when you can see through the sand are great. We had so much space and Suraj who cleaned our room was wonderful. Left animals made out of towels almost every day and the kids were so excited to see what he had done next. We had a menagerie by the end an elephant monkey dog peacock and aligatorImperial club gave the kids access to the kids club the majority of the day. We used it a couple of times and they had a blast and were happy to go back. Used a nanny provided by the hotel one night these ladies work in the kids club as well and she was great girls had fun with her. Great to have access to the nannies because there are a few restaurants that kids under 10 can not go to. Overall a wonderful place. Really enjoyed. Service was kind and attentive. Expensive and do not know that I had think Atlantis in Bahamas would warrant it but do think it fair there is a premium for the Dubai location.", "offset": [2155, 2298], "date": "2015-02-28", "cpt": "0", "category": "transport"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "c2c76c1e-93c3-4eb2-8b81-def95240deb4", "sentence": "I wish it was perfect. When it comes to Atlantic the palm I visited with my family for more than three times already. The hotel hardware was very nice and impressive with its own aquarium right at the hotel lobby near the water park. I went there because my kids love the water park. The hotel has many nice restaurants as well from western food to Japanese all nice in food and environment. However the check in was always very slow even I am with the suites which get to check in at a special room. But I do not really understand was that every time took forever to get it done. Since the hotel is huge breakfast also become a problem. Most of the time I have to line up and wait. Many people to serve so imagine you are paying a thousand USD per night for the suite but you need to wait in line for breakfast. At the point I am not so convinced. Also the coordination of the limo transfer also not very good. There was nobody to check with me before departure I need to ask for and confirm myself. And I booked a Mercedes GL to go to airport but always become something else like the Van but I was not notified just happened.

Not worth it unles you have small kids. My husband and I stayed at the Atlantis for 3 magical days. We had the best time. We had room 9463 it was an ocean view and we had a fab balcony that you could sit out on. We stayed half board and had really nice food. Breakfast and a choice of restaurants for evening meal. Rooms fantastic. We tried to upgrade but they were fully booked. Really happy we did not upgrade as did not want to leave our swimming or chilling out to go back to eat in a packed restaurant. Make sure you book your eve meal then you can jump the cue at the door. tip 1. We went in the water park and it was great fun but water shoes before you go. The floor is so hot you can not walk on it. \u00a3 5 off EBay before we went or \u00a3 30 in Atlantis. tip 2. Ask for a Ocean view you get the most fabulous evening sun until about 7 pm. tip 3. We went to the Mall on the free hotel bus. First bus goes at 10 we were in the line waiting for the bus at 930. it is a first come first service so do not expect to turn up at 950 and get on the bus. tip 4. If you need a taxi from the hotel do not ask the concierge for one. He will add extra on. Walk out the hotel and taxis are waiting there. These are metered so you can see what you get. tip 5. My biggest and by far the best top tip is buy drinks at home. We bought 2 bottles of Bacardi at the airport for \u00a3 22 for 2. We had filled our suitcase with coke and nibbles. We worked out if we had bought Bacardi and coke in the hotel we would of spent \u00a3 80. Top tip tip 6. Yes you can buy drinks there but it is so expensive. Actually the whole Dubai is expensive. We did buy a pizza for lunch and had 2 beers that was \u00a3 14 each per beer. it is super hot and not many people were sunbathing as its hot hot hot. We enjoyed was a real eye opener. Seeing how the people of Dubai live. We felt very safe the whole stay and I wore shorts and strapy tops everywhere and not once did I get asked to cover up. Airport coming back was ok. Few shops nothing spectacular. Was shocked it was not amazing. My husband commented on how disgusting the mens toilets were in the airport.

My husband and I stayed an amazing 5 nights at the Atlantis and we were both blown away. From the minute you arrive the service is impeccable the presentation of the hotel breathtaking and the overall experience was faultless. PACKAGE IMPERIAL CLUBAfter reading other reviews on here and consulting with a few travel agents we felt the best option was the Imperial Club package and gosh were we happy we did it. So many thoughtful inclusions fresh fruit and chocolates on arrival unlimited bottled water in the room unlimited access to the waterpark and the aquarium made an excellent stay even better. The best part of the package for us was the food. Breakfast is included and you can choose from 4 different restaurants within the hotel. Breakfast finishes at 11 am and then from 230pm1030pm or thereabouts there is almost continuous and unlimited food and drink in the imperial club lounge photo attached. Afternoon tea 230 430 is finger sandwiches salads scones hot dishes fruit and soft drink water tea cofeHapy Hour 5 7 is free alcohol cheeses antipasto food chips soft drink water tea cofeEvening snacks 8 10. chips biscuits soft drink water tea cofeOne day we actually did not pay anything for food and drink we just kept going back to the Imperial club which made it very worthwhileYou will also have exclusive access to the Imperial Club Beach which has its own drinks station and private concierge which was a nice additional touch. ROOM AMENITIESI am a self confessed germophobe and while I can and have roughed it I definitely do relax and appreciate it when the cleanliness of a bathroom and room is of a high standard. Try as I might I literally can not fault the cleanliness of the rooms bathrooms or general facilities within the complex. On our last day we were relaxing in our room before our 20 hour trip home and had a do not disturb light on the entire day housekeeping went so far as to drop postcards under our door twice within the afternoon reminding us that they would like to clean the room and to let them know a suitable time for them to come. I saw a review recently that said the rooms were tired and in need of renovation but this was definitely not our experience. Our rooms were 100 5 star standard. FODOh my gosh the food. If you are expecting fine dining as part of your inclusions then this is not the place for you. If you appreciate a gastronomic smorgasbord of food as far as the eye can see this is the place for you. While there are fine dining options available within the complex hello underwater restaurant. the included options of Kaleidoscope Imperial Club Saffron and another Lebanese restaurant the name escapes me something beginning with A were perfect for us. The sheer size of these buffets is like nothing I have ever seen. It took sometimes 5 minutes just to wander through all the different stations to see what the options were. Picture food as far as the eye can see or a ballroom a third full of tables of food and you are on the right track. KIDSBefore we arrived I had read a few reviews complaining about the amount of kids and whatnot running around the place. it is true there are a lot of them but we found that you could normally find a corner away from them and the restaurants were big enough that they were not really a problem. The weekend Friday and Saturday in the UAE was definitely a lot worse and even I was a little overwhelmed with the amount of people children that suddenly appeared but I am sure in the more expensive fine dining restaurants it would not be an issue. RAMADANWe were at the Atlantis the final week of Ramadan which had both pros and cons. The pros were reduced pricing on most entertainment more cultural things to experience Ramadan tent for iftar for exampleThe cons were all nightlife ceased to exist due to cultural restrictions. We were disappointed we were unable to party on at one of the nightclubs within the complex during the day there were reduced activities and the streets were quite empty which made it hard to enjoy being out and aboutJust remember if you are going to be out and about be sensitive to cultural expectations ladies no bare shoulders or upper arms. long pants recommended not so fun in 40 degree heat. and remember that it is actually illegal to eat drink or chew gum in public. We found however that there were screened off areas within the shopping malls and other areas where you could go and swig some water behind a screen or have something to eat. I was surprised to see people blatantly ignore the dress codes and choose quite skimpy outfits at that. There did not seem to be any repercussions for them but we prefer to be as respectful as possible to the culture that we are visiting and for this reason chose to cover up. SHUTTLE SERVICEI wish I had known about this earlier. There is a golf cart FREE shuttle service that runs the length of the complex and is SUPER to save you walking long distances in the heat. It starts between the pool and the beach and runs all the way through into the other end of the water park. LOOK UP. And aroundOne of the things that most impressed me was the level of detail that went into the design of the hotel. When you are walking though the common areas LOOK UP. They have the most amazing paintings on the ceiling which I loved looking at. The more we looked around the more you noticed the level of care and thought that had been put into even the smallest details within the complex. I have travelled widely and do not recall seeing this level of detail anywhere else. LOCATIONOk so we had no idea how far away this hotel was from Dubai itself. We spent a small fortune on taxis to and from Dubai and spoke to other hotel guests who made similar remarks. There is a monorail service but we did not use it. On average we paid between 70 100 dirhams 30 40 AUD for a one way trip into Dubai which took around 30 minutes. The fact that the hotel is so far out from everything else is probably the only drawback I can think of but if you come prepared and look into local public transport options before coming. it would be more manageable. SHOPINGThere are a lot of luxury and boutique shops within the complex however be warned that the prices are quite hiked up. We paid 300 dirham for a sand drawing in a bottle on the first day we got there and then later found street vendors that were doing the same thing for a quarter of the price. Overall we would highly recommend this hotel to couples solos and families wanting for a good package at a luxury hotel. It was worth the money to us and to be honest it did exceed our expectations.", "offset": [4780, 4833], "date": "2017-06-25", "cpt": "0", "category": "transport"}, {"id": 10, "uid": "fb3e7976-779c-46c2-a46e-4d55bf5b407b", "sentence": "Short break in June.

Let me begin by saying that it is not the fault of the staff. Almost all of the staff at the Atlantis appeared to be committed or at least very well trained to providing good service and soliciting guest feedback regardless of position. Everyone from the VIP Manager to the concierge from the waiters or Spa masseuse to the luggage porters seemed genuinely interested in whether the guests were enjoying themselves. But our family frankly needed another vacation after leaving this energy sapping resort. What a relief to leave the Atlantis and get home to some peace and quiet. Every single part of the hotel was loud fast tempo music blasting at a loud volume crowded imagine rush hour traffic at a train station and add selfie sticks. glitzy every surface seemed to shine with over the top multi media or d\u00e9cor and heavily perfumed the omnipresent scent diffusers were always in overdrive not to mention hard sell. There was no escape. No way to relax at polside or on a private balcony or on a restaurant terrace since the music was painfully loud indoors and out. Just walking the endless kilometers of gleaming corridors picture a pricey Las Vegas casino crossed with a New Jersey shopping mall was exhausting. Not because of the distance we love to walk but because of the crowds and assault on the senses at every turn. Restaurants at the hotel however chic the d\u00e9cor offered no relief from the pounding noise. Even the zen music in the Spa area was loud. Our family had a suite and an imperial room on the Club floor a life saver if you can afford the upgrade so thankfully we had access to a semi oasis in the comfortable Club Lounge for breakfast high tea and happy hour. but even there it was busy and loud. And experiences that should have been an absolute delight such as swimming with the dolphins at the hotels huge water park were cheapened by a conveyor belt feel swimming with the dolphins meant one belly ride of a few meters and that is it for the swim. We have had far better more intimate dolphin encounters elsewhere. The private beach was less noisy but also fairly small cluttered and had a very unromantic industrial view. Did I mention that this challenging resort experience was extremely expensive as well. I am not sure how to begin measuring value for money in such a case. There were of course good things at Atlantis The Palm. I already mentioned the hard working service minded staff. And the spectacular aquarium does add something uniquely special to the interior especially in the exceptional Osiano restaurant. Our kids teenagers enjoyed the water park despite the long waits for each activity. And our rooms were spacious and generally well designed with comfortable beds and good views and amenities though we had to change rooms after drilling and construction below us woke us up the first morning. Make sure to ask where the construction is taking place on the dates of your stay since there is always construction and request a room in the opposite wing. The concierge is very helpful in booking activities such as the fantastic desert trips through Royal Heritage. And some of the restaurants are really very good at least food and decor wise. All in all if you are looking for a relaxing intimate authentic vacation experience this is not the place for you. If however you are looking for 247 stimulation for you and your kids and do not mind vacationing in the environment described above go for it.", "offset": [88, 262], "date": "2018-03-04", "cpt": "1", "category": "transport"}, {"id": 13, "uid": "3e995204-e2b1-40d4-a0f4-8d654dcc8ef9", "sentence": "I chose not to participate in the water park or the aquarium here because I believe that if you have access to the others not far away they were a better value.
