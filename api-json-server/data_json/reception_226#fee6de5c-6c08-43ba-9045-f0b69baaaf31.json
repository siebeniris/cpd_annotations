Luckily there was still a room available so all seemed good. Strike two we had to request a fridge in our room. My roommate is diabetic and she needed to keep her insulin cold. Strange enough that not all rooms have fridges but ok. We waited and waited and no fridge came so insulin was kept in an ice bucket. Along the way we also requested extra towels they took over an hour but eventually came. The cups we requested never did. Strike three on both mornings we were woken up before 8 am by housekeeping.

I do not take leaving a one star review lightly as I run a high end vacation rental property and reviews are a properties bread and butter. However my experience was such that I believe other guests need to be warned to find another property. Four Points are franchises and the Sheraton name is licensed. Apparently the owners of the Sheraton brand name do not have high standards for their franchisees. We arrived at midnight. Desk clerk saw us and never greeted us. He seemed to be frantically trying to get key cards made for a couple of ladies waiting for their room. I am assuming their room was n\u2019t ready either. Read on. While waiting to be at least greeted I saw a piece of paper that this Four Points Sheraton forced you to sign. It basically said that we needed to be quiet. We were warned that if we were n\u2019t quiet we would be charged 2500 to compensate other guests who would be disturbed. I have been traveling for over 35 years and have never been required to sign such a document. This screams scam to me and thinking back I should have never signed that. I will be looking at my credit card very carefully for charges. We were just so tired. I am finally greeted and told at midnight my room is n\u2019t ready. I am offered a King with a pullout instead.
