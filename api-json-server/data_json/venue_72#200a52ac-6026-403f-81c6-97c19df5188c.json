I took a late bus to Indianapolis but for some reasons that bus was delayed for hours and hours so I reached the hotel almost 7 am the next morning. When I approached the check in counter I was greeted with Sorry we have no rooms available. I told the snooty guy that I have a reservation for the previous night but he would not believe it as the hotel was full there was a marathon event in the city on the day I arrived. I had to show him my printed confirmation even though he could have asked for my name and check their booking records in the first place. When he asked for a credit card for incidentals and I showed him my platinum card his attitude obviously changed I thought really. To be honest I never felt discriminated against like this before. Anyway eventually I was given a room on the 9th floor. Next in the room there was no available pen to write my request for some amenities and so when I was going out for sightseeing I took the request card with me and filled it up downstairs and tried to hand it to one of the staff in the check in counter but she refused to accept it. She said that the room cleaning staff are the ones responsible for those requests and that she could not go to where they were and the cleaning staff were not allowed to go to the lobby. I could see the walkie talkie they use to contact porters but guess what she told me to go back to my room on the 9th floor and put the request card in my room. I could not believe what I just heard and I almost exploded in anger. I did it anyway just so not to ruin my day. When I got back to the hotel in the evening the card was still there but the requested amenities were not. Fortunately I saw one of the cleaning staff and so I rushed into her and handed the request card. At first she would not accept it but then had a second thought and said she had take care of it. Which she did not. Until I checked out. As one of my criteria in assessing the hotel service upon my check out I asked if they could mail out a post card for me. To my surprise they did. And they did not charge me for it. Well the staff this time was different from the day before. The room itself was nice with a view of the capitol which was a paid upgrade. But other than that the customer service was terrible.

Good things first this hotel is walking distance to pretty much anything downtown lots of restaurants and shopping Lucas Oil Stadium convention center. it is also a nice looking hotel in the public areas room was comfortable. Not so good. Overpriced I thought. Our room was on the small side and the two beds were doubles not queens. We were there on a busy weekend with a lot of events and the hotel was clearly quite full but I felt service was lacking even considering that. Although valet service was friendly it was rather slow and 40 night is a bit much. Prices seemed on par with valet hotel in Chicago not Indianapolis. Bad We booked well in advance at a group rate and were confirmed for a double room. When I arrived I was told there were no double rooms available. I was offered a king with a rolaway. That was not really acceptable to me even at a reduced rate and after seeing the size of the rooms I do not think that would have been comfortable at all but it was better than no room so I agreed. While they were looking for a room for me three different parties checked in at the desk next to mine and all three somehow got double rooms despite checking in after me. After the third one the woman working on my reservation told me she had found a double for me. Great. As I said the room was small but at least it was the double I had requested. The second day we were there housekeeping came at 830am. We were not ready yet and asked them to come back later they never came back. We got back to our room around 3 pm and it had not been serviced. I called the front desk they said someone would come up so we went out to the mall for a bit and came back and the room was just as it had been when we left. I called again and the woman who answered seemed surprised that we would bother to call again but said she would let housekeeping know I was waiting. A few minutes later I got a call from a manager who said I was supposed to have checked out and when was I leaving they would service the room then. We were reserved for another night and I let him know that at which point he muttered something about the group rate and then said someone would come up. We finally got the room serviced 20 minutes after that well after 4 pm. There was no apology for either the lack of service or the suggestion that I overstayed my reservation.", "offset": [367, 510], "date": "2016-11-14", "cpt": "0", "category": "venue"}, {"id": 6, "uid": "d271ef25-b0c2-4c4e-b53b-50c914913a1e", "sentence": "Bed bugs. I recently stayed at this hotel for a dance competition. My overall room seemed fine but my friends room had a bedbug infestation and she was forced to move to a completely different hotel as the Hyat was sold out. They seem completely incapable of handling the crowd from the convention as the Starbucks in the lobby had a line of people 30 deep and only two employees working. The hotel check in staff was lovely and very accommodating.
