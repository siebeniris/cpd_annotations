I have stayed in this hotel 4 5 times in the past several years for conferences and have enjoyed it each time. it is beginning to feel almost like a home away from home. The hotel is quite nice and in an excellent location right on the river. Not super fancy but not average run of the mill either. The lobby and common areas are lovely. the rooms are very clean comfortable and well appointed. Great scenic view of the river on one side the city on the other. We love the downtown location because restaurants shopping and attractions are all just a few blocks walk away. Parking is not ideal in that you have to pay to park in a garage but that is to be expected in a downtown hotel anywhere. The staff is always very nice. The hotel valet drove my kids to a restaurant in the middle of the night and picked them back up as a courtesy. I have only two negative things to say about this hotel. One the lack of free wifi throughout the hotel. In this day and age even campgrounds and the cheapest of motels have free wifi so it is very surprising this hotel does not. Two the comforters on the beds weigh a TON. No kidding. they are freakishly heavy and a pain to deal with. Certainly not a major issue but it is something we complain about every night when we stay here.

I have to say I was not impressed. I had just stayed the week before at a much lesser hotel and it was much cleaner and well kept than this Sheraton. Several people I met shared similar thoughts. We all noticed that our headboards on beds were torn up hard to reach places were seriously dusty and dirty and one woman said there were blood stains on her sheets. The rooms walls were either scuffed or torn in several places too. I also noticed that the elevators were seriously dingy and in need of cleaning. Things like the inside of the elevator doors looked like they had not been cleaned in years. It gave me a creepy feeling using them and I was just really disappointed. Probably the biggest surprise was the PARKING. You either had to pay a ridiculous rate for valet or park in the parking garage which was on the other side of some sort of large apartment building which itself was on the far side of the hotels parking lot not nearly close enough to the hotel. Not to mention there were not even sidewalks that went to it. You had to walk through parking lots and an open road area to get to it. I arrived around 10 pm and was more than a little unnerved walking from this garage with my bags in tow with absolutely no one around but me and the criminals. Oh and where are the vending machines. The one I found was hidden behind the bar in the restaurant. On the floors they only have drinks. The gift shop is ridiculous. I paid 4 for a 16 oz water. Never again. The one thing I can say about this hotel is it is location. You certainly can not beat the view. Looking out over the glistening water is enough to relax anyone. The staff were also extremely nice from housekeeping to those in the restaurant. Everyone went out of their way to be hospitable.

The ironing board in my room was filthy and stained. There was a dead cricket hanging from a ceiling tile right in the middle of our conference room. The list goes on and on. Finally the internet speed in the room business center and conference areas was almost never above 2Mbps and often below 1Mbps. The FCC recently raised the definition of broadband from 4Mbps to 25 which means the Sheraton Norfolk Waterside hotel is conducting false advertising when they promote their internet availability and speed.

I do not do reviews often and I do not recall ever giving a bad review. it is not my style. But the operations of this property was so bad my eperience so bad. that now upon returning home here I am. The property is undergoing a renovation the scope of which is not accurately displayed on its website. The site used to mention that the club level lounge was under construction until April 2017 checked website on May 20 2017. It today shows nothing as if the property is in regular working order. In fact the front desk is non operative they are working off of three computers in the little sundry store the hotel restaurant is in a meeting room with a bar that is long enough for two barstols and has so few tables that breakfast was a 45 minute wait and the club level lounge is still not open more on this later. This is a pet friendly hotel which is nice. We travel with our dog so we booked via a third party bringfidocom owned by expedia. one night on the club level for a room noting that we had be bringing a dog. Then it went downhil1. You should know if you book at this hotel that if you are bringing a pet you do not be up on the club level even if you have already paid for it. The club level is on the propertys 10th and highest floor. you will be on the third or fourth floor do not expect a view of the water. I wish that website would have been clear about that but it is not 2. Apparently my reservation did not get into the Sheraton system noting that I had have a dog. Upon my arrival at 40 propertys check in time I was informed my room was not ready. Just come back in 30 minutes I am told. So the family and dog hang out with our bags in the hallway that now substitutes as the lobby since the front desk got moved. Nothing more fun than waiting in a hallway with an impatient child and hyper dog for half an hour for a room that is not available after posted check in time3. I get back in the longish line a half hour later. When I get to the desk I mention. did you get the note about me having a dog. Oh no we did not. Now we do not have any rooms on the pet level ready. We. did finally clear up a room on the club level though. but that is not for you even though you booked and prepaid for that. Wait a while longer4. Another nearly half hour later we get a room for a room on the pet floor. it is a pretty standard room as far as rooms go. We ask the front desk hey so we paid 100 more for a room on the club level. You just now mention that there is no club level lounge because it is still under renovation even though your website says that it will be done in April. it is the end of May what gives. The reply was that they had have people shuttle snacks and drinks up to our room in lieu of the snacks and drinks in the club lounge being available 247. Here are your coupons for breakfast buffet in our restaurant in lieu of breakfast in the cub lounge5. A couple of hours go by and no snacks. did not know what was going on. I call the operator who confidently assures me that they will surely bring snacks and drinks up to the room. Of course they never come. We go out to dinner come back at 10 still nothing. By then it is the kids bedtime so we completely give up6. We wake having paid for an overnight at the club level having had none of the benefits. Okay let us head on down to the restaurant to have breakfast before heading out. Upon arriving there are people lounging around outside waiting and you know it is bad news. The line represents a small meeting room converted to a restaurant and which can not come close to accommodating demand. At the 55 minute wait point for a htel breakfast we give up. The Sheraton Norfolk Waterside wins no mas. We go upstairs and pack. Try to check out via the system on the TV system of course it is not working. One last final kick on the way out of the hotel. I ended up pre paying for a night in at the club level and got zero out of the upcharge. The property failed at every juncture. Again search my reviews and you will see that I am not a complainer. This property is that bad. Up the street are a fine looking Hilton and Mariot.

I did not see any warning of this and became very aware just a few steps into the Sheratons doors. Loud sawing and hammering until 5 pm. I went to check in and asked about the lobby being in disarray and was confronted with a throw away explanation by the front desk staff who was completely unconcerned with my experience at the hotel they represent. I tell them that I will make due. The two desk associates then tell me that the room I booked for well over 200 with two queen beds was unavailable and they would give me one king and a pull out. I told them this was not what I payed for nor would the accommodations be sufficient for my friend and I I was met with an oh well response. I told the desk I wanted to cancel my reservation and would like a refund and was told I would have to talk to hotelscom. This is the moment I became completely faithful with this website booking agent. I spoke with two employees who were nothing but great. They understood my plight and offered me a refund. They also offered me a price matching with hotels in the area or a relocation within the hotel itself. Well guess what. Hotelscom contacted the hotel notified them of my cancelation approval and all of a sudden a room with two queens and a city view popped up out of nowhere. Thanks hotelscom.

We are Platinum members getting close to lifetime. and we were disappointed in our stay at this hotel. The location is great right next to the water and lots of restaurants nearby but that is where it ends. I appreciate they are remodeling the hotel it is worthy of a remodel and I will not complain about the obvious construction going on and need for the upgrade. When we checked in the associate checking us in needed more training. No smile. no nothing. I know they are supposed to acknowledge our platinum status but I rarely care about whether they do or not but for the record no acknowledgment. We asked whether our suite night request had been applied and she said she did not know what a Suite Night award was. Sigh. Needs training. Did not tell us about the Platinum lounge discovered it later. Overall not exactly a charming first start but we were just happy to be there. Got to our room Suite Night and the pull out bed is not arranged. I wonder why no one ever asks if we need to have the pull out couch arranged when we stand there checking in with our two kids. Do they think our 7 and 9 year old are going to squish into the king bed with us. So we ask to have the bed arranged while we go out. We come back and it is certainly arranged but also broken. The bed is obviously collapsing in the middle sigh. I had the kids make the best of it and wonder why I used a Suite Night to upgrade to this pleasure we had two queen beds on our original reservation. Not wanting to move I check with the front desk in the morning. They send a technician who confirms the bed is broken beyond repair. They send up cots. Ok. Fine. Makes me wonder in hindsight why as long time Platinum members we were not assigned a room on the Club level and one of the remodeled rooms. When I did finally find the Platinum lounge the gentlemen in charge up there was very nice. Sigh. Wish we had not missed out on the lounge. Lastly let us talk about restaurant. First morning we went to breakfast we were given our basic drinks and then practically never saw the server again. I know it is a buffet but coffee refills are not self serve. I could not even find our server to ask about whether we needed to sign anything prior to leaving. We left and left no tip. If I can not find you to even ask about a bill I guess I am also not tipping anything. Second morning same thing different server. Left a 250 tip. Third morning my husband went down to a quick breakfast without us because he had an early morning meeting. He forgot his breakfast coupon. He told the restaurant manager he had forgotten the coupon upstairs and he did not have time to go grab it he just wanted to grab some yogurt and coffee before he had to run out the door. The Restaurant Manager told him he would have to charge him for the meal. did not offer to go look up if our breakfast was included or ask the front desk which is literally right there. That was not the right way to handle the problem. Disgruntled because he does not have time to go get the coupon he sits down resolved to pay for it. Joyce his server took care of my husband. Unknown to her it was actually my husbands birthday. Such a small act of customer service. it is not like the restaurant and hotel do not know or can not go look it up that we have breakfast as our platinum gift. Surely they could have sorted this without telling my husband they have to charge him or at least tell him they will charge him for it for now but back it out when I can deliver the coupon. The whole coupon thing is pretty dumb and complicated anyway. I wish they would dispense with it. I mean really I hate having to keep track of breakfast coupons. We went to the Westin in Savannah and they do it without coupons. If they can figure it out along with several other SPG properties anyone else can too. My husband ate what he could after all the silliness and ran out the door. He left Joyce a nice tip. Anyway my children and I went down to breakfast ourselves and sat in Joyces section. Joyce was wonderful. She was the first of any of our servers to offer my girls waffles. None of the other servers offered omelettes or waffles to us. it is like they would rather avoid the extra work for themselves and the kitchen. Anyway Joyce refilled our coffee was always available throughout and it meant so much that she had taken care of my husband the right way in the morning. Good Job Joyce you know good customer service. I left her a 20 tip in addition to the nice tip my husband had left in the morning. The only thing that makes me sad is that she probably has to share that with her colleagues who are not delivering the same level of customer service. I am all about tipping for good service especially at breakfast. These are the people that set the tone for your day and wake up early to get breakfast on. I have to say I also have read plenty of reviews on here where the management responds to reviews. I am glad management is paying attention to the reviews but I can not see how this is translating into better customer service. With the hotel under renovation customer service really needs to shine and make up for what the hotel currently lacks. Our room was visibly worn our bed was fixed with a staple gun along the headboard. Chairs in the restaurant were actually torn open at the base. I can excuse these things knowing they are renovating if the customer service shines. Unfortunately for the Sheraton Norfolk we stayed at the Westin Savannah directly afterwards. Everyone smiles at that hotel and are amazingly friendly. The difference was just so stark. And of course no dumb coupons. I really hope they are able to make changes at the Sheraton Norfolk. There is good potential at this property.

The connection was always interrupted and every four or five minutes I was forced to reconect. When I had a connection sites like Facebok were very very slow. There are two potential reasons for this so many people were using the network or the network itself is just weak and needs to be replaced.

My husband called down to the desk to ask \u201c WTF \u201d and the desk said they had n\u2019t double booked the room and would check on what the deal was and call is back. No call back. Next morning visited the lounge for the continental breakfast. Ca n\u2019t speak to that because an hour before breakfast ended there was nothing left. Not one pastry no eggs the coffee machine was broken though they did have a carafe available and there was a few measly pieces of fruit. The big turnoff though was that the place was a mess. There are no visible trash cans so guests just left plates and trash everywhere. No visible staff to clean up. The room was good the customer service so so but the amenities on the club floor dismal. That said the good outweighed the bad so I would stay again.", "offset": [1725, 1808], "date": "2018-05-07", "cpt": "2", "category": "general"}, {"id": 23, "uid": "a350ea15-1c3c-45e5-8ae1-91e3a31a9dbc", "sentence": "Nice Location Hotel. Stayed here for a friends wedding. Very good location near the Waterside district and Granby Street which seems like the go to area for bars food in Norfolk. Liked the room facing the water w the naval shipyard in the background. The room comes with an abundance of USB ports. You can self park in the garage. Only a 5 minute walk to the hotel. The only negative I would have to say is the lounge. Love the staff but the offering is not splendid.

Had early morning surgery scheduled at Sentara Norfolk Hospital and did not want to get caught up in a morning rush hour with the likelihood of a tunnel back up. Parking was in a nearby commercial building which required lugging ones bags for 100 or 150 yards. Not a good thing for a pre operation challenge. In any case we booked the Sheraton Waterside which conveniently was only minutes away. The hotel was recently revamped and had a nice modern touch. The staff was very responsive. The restaurant was quite good. Eating late we opted for a light seafood dinner which was excellent. The price for a waterfront lodging was quite reasonable.

First we discover they over charged us by almost 400 and the front desk clerk did n\u2019t show any care in the world. very poor customer service. She acknowledged that we were charged too much but no apology. She just told us we would have to wait 3 4 business days to get our money back for the hotel \u2019s mistake.
