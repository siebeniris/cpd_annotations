And they prepared us with a yoga mat beach bag and beach towel that was very nice do not bother to bring lots of things with you because you can just used the hotel facilities. The breakfast had lots of choice but the taste was just ok. TV channel was so limited but if you have Bali and its beaches and hotel facilities why bother ti stay and watch TV.

We stayed in a 1 bedroom suite for 4 nights and loved it. The room was huge and had 2 bathrooms a living room with sofa bed and a big balcony overlooking the main pool. Plenty of room for our 25yo to enjoy. And plenty of room for us to relax once she was asleep. The cot supplied was a good condition portacot. It was well furnished. Loved the extra touches such as espresso machine. Our only 2 complaints in regards to the room in fact in regards to the whole stay where that the room had a smell especially noticeable after being out and coming back to the closed room. To describe it would be a musty water smell it also smelt when you first turned on the shower. In saying this is was not so terrible that we could not deal with it but I would imagine some people would not want to put up with it being that it is a five star hotel and you are paying good money. We on the other hand loved everything else about this resort that it was a small gripe to have. Our second complaint would be house keeping. They were very average in cleaning compared to other places we have stayed. Now besides that everything was fantastic. The staff service facilities are first rate. Breakfast was a massive setup and you would be hard pressed not to find something for even the fussiest eaters. We had a lunch and dinner there both were lovely. The nightly buffets looked good also. We had an hour bali massage at the spa as a couple and this was heaven. The spa is beautiful and peaceful. Everything you could need and want is available. The location is perfect opposite the beach and along Melasti street so no limit to food and shopping just outside the door. The transfer service was prompt and helpful.

Breakfast again is way overpriced if buying it each morning. Check in was an absolute nightmare. It took over 2 hours to check our group in and even after we were done only 1 of the 4 rooms were ready.

In addition rooms are well equipped by good design wifi connection and are very spacious. The buffet breakfast has a wide range of fabulous products and the restaurant is very good as well combining local dishes with international cuisine. Excellent amenities are well provided and hotel facilities as the gym business room or the magnificent pool with the sea view makes this hotel one of the best ones in the hospitality industry.

I booked this hotel for our family as it was reasonably priced and guaranteed interconnecting rooms. My expectation was n\u2019t set that high as we wanted to stay at The Padma but as visiting Bali annually the Padma gets way too expensive. so the Pullman it was this year. I would rate this hotel very high it was fantastic. The staff were very friendly even remembering my children \u2019s names every time we walked out the gate which was lovely. The rooms were kept clean and the staff did an excellent job at this. Every time we walked in the foyer there was always someone cleaning sweeping etc kept immaculate. Breakfast was included in our package and exceeded all expectations. A great spread every morning. Water supplied in your room for drinking as well as for brushing your teeth. We had an ocean view room and was great. Only downfall was the lack of pools. infinity pool on level 3 was ok. Hardly any shade and felt like you were swimming in a big fish pond the way it was tiled out. The ground floor pool was full of kids. do n\u2019t worry I had my two kids with me. kids jumping in splashing those adults who were on holidays trying to relax. babies in nappies floating around kids snoting in it screaming mums and Dads telling toddlers off. phew it was a great pool for those kids but no one else.

The room was a bit disappointing lighting was very dim no lights on roof only dim warm globe lamps which is fine if you do n\u2019t need to see things clearly. Day 3 no water pressure coming from the shower only a dribble. Waited over an hour for water to be restored. Room was cleaned in the afternoon on a few occasions which is slack. The \u201c free \u201d photo shoot produced absolutely NO shots in focus to choose from so was a total waste of our time. The free spa vouchers were only able to be used late at night on our last few days due to there being no availability. The pools were dirty and main pool was full of hair and squirrel po. The pool towels smelt. LASTLY and most disturbingly my husband has just been discharged from hospital back in Australia after eating a buffet meal at the hotel on our last night he became violently ill and that infection travelled to his heart and caused serious complications in an otherwise healthy young man with no existing health issues at all.
