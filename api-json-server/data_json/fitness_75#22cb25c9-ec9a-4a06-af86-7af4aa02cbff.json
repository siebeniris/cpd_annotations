We are SPG members so were got an 830 am check in. They also provided use in 2 bottles free water free wifi and a room on the 13th floor in the tower overlooking downtown Toronto. We were with family members who are not SPG members so they did not get the free water in the room free wifi or a room in the tower building. There are apples and flavoured water in the lobby. There is free filtered drinking water in the gym so fill up your water bottles. Across the street there are fast food restaurants and a korean supermarket. To the west there is a Longos supermarket banks Shoppers drug market and fast food restaurants. We had one slight confusion with the green option with regards to housekeeping. When we were there hotel renovations were occurring between the lobby and the japanese restaurant katsura. These renovations did not effect our stay in anyway. I enjoyed the pool very much even though it was crowded. The pool was clean and warm enough for my swim workouts. The hot tub was clean and the temperature was set. 100 degrees F. The only problem was the pool kiosk was always low on towels so go to the gym which is next door and use the smaller gym towels. The bedroom and bathroom are what you expect on a spg dedicated floor. We only had banquet food at the hotel which was surprisingly good. Overall a nice place to stay with friendly service if your events are uptown. but if you are first time Toronto tourist and want to go downtown you may want to choose another Westin closer to downtown.", "offset": [1016, 1072], "date": "2015-08-03", "cpt": "0", "category": "fitness"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "c9d773b4-72a3-489d-a69c-1275a6f03f6b", "sentence": "Third visit only confirms our previous impression of profesonal and classy hotel with beautiful landscaped surroundings. This was our third visit to the Westin Prince and like our previous visits we were impressed by the professional and friendly service our upgraded room and the beautiful lush landscape that provided opportunities for strolling in woods meditating or just sitting in lawn chairs overlooking the ravine below. In addition there was a large pool dry sauna jacuzi tennis court and gym. It resembled a spa retreat in a sense. In addition we really like the abundant choice of restaurants across the street in a series of strip shopping centers which are literally side by side with varying quality food opportunities much like Toronto itself. I would recommend the Pho establishment and the Spoon and Fork buffet personally. The Westin Prince is an ideal place for a vacation as the ambiance is relaxed professional and spa like. As well there is a large park system just south of the hotel that by itself is beautiful in addition to being part of the Lower Don bikeway a bike trail that leads all the way to downtown Toronto and the waterfront. The hotel is also located very near the Don Valley Parkway which is usually a quick drive downtown of maybe 20 minutes in non rush hour traffic.

The location was fine for the things we wanted to do. The room was dark and was almost impossible to find a place to put make up on. Interesting bathroom as they had a little area that could be used for dressing and applying make up. There were no electrical outlets in this area and it was about 120 degrees as the air conditioning never reached it. It was always hot and uncomfortable. There was a mirror in the larger area of the room but the lighting was so bad and the fact there was no electrical outlet nearby made it hard to use for anything. When we checked in it was obvious there were 3 of us 2 adults and 1 teenager. When she checked the room she said it was 2 double beds and asked if we would prefer a King bed. I asked if there was a sleeper sofa in the room and she said no. Okay so you are looking at us and we are three adults basically and you are offering a room with ONE King bed. really. The room was huge and had plenty of room for 2 King beds. The double beds were NOT comfortable and one of them made so much noise when you turned over that it woke everyone else up. The air conditioning was super loud and kept us up or woke us up when it clicked on or off. The restaurant was okay but terribly over priced for what was served. The parking is over priced as well. The parking was also an issue. We decided to park our car at our familys and they dropped us off at the hotel. When asked about parking we thought about it and then said no thank you. However they charged us for it anyway. I am glad I looked at the invoice. Then when they said they would take it off the bill they could not give me another receipt showing it had been removed. Really. Checked my bank today and they have NOT removed the charge. The only thing that was positive about the hotel was that it was at least somewhat close to all our activities.
