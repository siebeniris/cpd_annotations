The hotel policy is maximum room capacity 2 adults 1 child but my 2 children easily could have fit in the enormous king size bed with my husband and I We had an interconnecting room with my mother that had 2 single beds. The hotel has a dated feel to it. While it is on Orchard Rd it is at the top end and I felt we were having to walk a lot to go anywhere. We did not eat at the hotel we chose to eat breakfast across the road in the mornings and other meals while we were exploring Singapore so I can not comment on their food. Next door is a shopping centre which has some interesting patrons at night. These patrons can be found loitering in the mornings and are shooed by police quite quickly. There is a large pool but it really looks neglected. There is a tiny kids playroom that the kids will get bored with in 10 minutes.
