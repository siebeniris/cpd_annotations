There was lots of light and a nice fireplace a wine refrigerator that was appreciated a large and modern bathroom. A bottle of wine was placed in our room and the morning breakfast is huge and tasty.

I stayed at this property for four nights with my wife on an annual vacation to NoCal wine country. It is our fifth stay at this property and our experience spans the recently completed renovation of all guest rooms. Vintage Inn is located just to the northern end of Yountvile adjacent to the French Laundry gardens and the St Helena highway. The hotel grounds are self enclosed gardens in and of themselves and lend the property a secluded and quiet feel. Downtown Yountvile is a quiet and delightfully smaller version of local wine country towns mostly focusing on restaurants rather than shopping. TripAdvisor folks will know that there are multiple excellent eateries in town with two of them TFL and Bouchon owning Michelin stars and TFL long considered one of the finest in the nation. While the old version of the Vintage Inn was completely fine the renovation has tastefully upgraded the comfortable french country vibe with upgrades to furniture fixtures and most importantly the bathrooms. Within that category there are differing bathroom layouts some have jacuzi tubs with a integrated shower that is a little awkward to use others have a very large dual use shower setup that is to my mind superior. All rooms as well as the common area are very well appointed impeccably clean and quiet. Parking is directly behind the hotel and accessible via a short walk through the grounds. Food offerings are worth discussing in detail as each morning Vintage offers a large buffet brunch that includes a mimosa bar an omelette station and on the weekends a waffle station as well. The food is of very high quality and there are multiple hot and cold choices on offer including fresh fruit bread muffins pastries and cheeses. The buffet is included in the rate and thus provides excellent value especially as a base meal from which you can attack the wineries up and down the valley. There is an afternoon tea in the main lobby if you are so disposed with more pastries and small sandwiches that is also included in your rate. I have always found service at Vintage to be at the superior level. From reservations to room needs to concierge service to housekeeping customer service is attentive friendly and willing. There also seems to be very little turnover in the core staff signaling a positive workplace with attention to detail our annual chats with Carlos at the omelette station for example are becoming a bit of a tradition. Check in is always friendly and breezy despite the fact that we are sometimes arriving very late at night after a cross country flight from IAD and subsequent drive up from SFO. One tiny complaint this year Vintage switched from in room Nespreso machines to in room Keurig machines. While this is clearly a matter of taste I preferred the coffee made by the former and despise the coffee made by the latter. Feel free to attach firstworldproblems to this whine and if it matters to you Bouchon Bakery makes excellent coffee less than a block down the street. I unreservedly recommend this hotel to all travelers heading to wine country. Given the quality of the rooms food and service I had even call this a bargain despite NY SF DC level pricing especially when you factor in the included breakfast brunch. We have yet to experience anything other than a delightful experience at this property and look forward to our next visit in December 2016.", "offset": [1780, 1937], "date": "2015-12-16", "cpt": "0", "category": "restaurant"}, {"id": 4, "uid": "e6eda3b8-5fe0-4f8e-b52c-be1abc748b00", "sentence": "Great Stay.

My fianc\u00e9e and I spent two nights at the Vintage Inn on a recent trip to visit Napa Valley wineries and we could not have been any happier with our hotel selection. We found the Vintage Inn and the town of Yountvile to be the perfect places to stay as a home base for our trip. The inn was just so cute and quaint \u2013 small enough to feel cozy large enough to operate as a well run hotel. Everything at the Vintage Inn from the room to the breakfast to the staff to the location was top notch and exceeded expectationsChosing the Hotel. This was our first trip to the Napa Valley so before arriving we really did n\u2019t have a good sense of the geography of the area. We identified pretty quickly that Napa Yountvile or St Helena would be the main towns to choose from for accommodations. My initial thought was to stay in the town of Napa simply because it was a familiar name which we assumed would be the center of the Napa Valley. However that \u2019s not really the case and after visiting I \u2019m glad we chose to stay in Yountvile instead. Napa is basically the first major town you encounter when driving into the valley from the San Francisco area and it \u2019s nice enough but it \u2019s more built up and more busy than we were looking for with many chain hotels restaurants and stores around. It is a larger town with more permanent residents and activity whereas Yountvile feels like a sleepy little village seemingly there almost solely for the benefit of tourists. Fine dining cute boutiques and wine shops are all within walking distance and everything looks perfect at all times in Yountvile. Beyond liking the quaint feel of Yountvile we found Yountvile to be much more convenient than Napa for visiting wineries St Helena would also be quite convenient. When driving up either the Silverado Trail or Route 29 the main concentration of wineries does n\u2019t really begin until you hit Yountvile and the towns going north. By staying at the Vintage Inn we were always close to the wineries we wanted to visit and could easily stop back at the hotel any time if we wanted or needed to. After identifying Yountvile as our ideal location for our accommodations we looked into the various hotel options in the town. The Vintage Inn and Vilago its very similar sister hotel right down the street both quickly came up quickly as options to consider. We also looked at several other hotels in Yountvile all of which looked great. However even though we were going to be staying during the shoulder season in November and we would be there on Sunday and Monday nights the prices still managed to be pretty high at every hotel in Yountvile. While exploring our options I noticed that Hotwire was offering one of its Hot Rate deals for a 4star hotel in Yountvile at a rate that was 50 less than the cheapest rate we were finding for any hotel in Yountvile at the time. The only catch was that the name of the hotel would n\u2019t be revealed until after we had booked and paid and it could n\u2019t be cancelled. Since every possible hotel option in Yountvile was appealing to us we were willing to take the risk. I was pretty sure we \u2019d get either the Vintage Inn or Vilago anyway and it turns out we got the Vintage Inn. The one and only somewhat frustrating experience with the Vintage Inn came right after we made our reservation. Hotwire specified that we were n\u2019t able to choose our room type and that the hotel would choose the room type for us based upon availability. Although we preferred a room with a king bed we were willing to take the risk that we \u2019d get a room with two beds to save money. I decided to call the hotel after we made our reservation in order to put in a request for a king bed. When I called the staff member I spoke with in the reservations department indicated that we had been blocked into a standard room with two queen beds. I had already done my research online and knew that the hotel still had standard rooms with a king bed available for our dates which sell for the same price as the standard rooms with two queens. I explained that we had booked on Hotwire and knew the hotel had discretion to choose our room type but that we would prefer to be blocked into an equivalent room with a king bed if possible. Her response was that our Hotwire reservation specified that we had to have a room with two beds so they could not change that in their system. She did note our request for a king bed which she said would be handled upon arrival. However I just found it odd that she acted as if the hotel had no control over its own reservations. The staff member I spoke with was n\u2019t necessarily rude but it seemed like it would be a really easy switch to block us into a king room. On the flip side since Hotwire specified that the hotel had full discretion to choose our room type I reminded myself that it was ultimately up to the hotel to choose to our room. During our stay we ended up with a perfect room with a king bed that we wanted so everything turned out fine. Arrival Experience. As soon as we drove up to the Vintage Inn I was pretty sure we had chosen the right hotel. The minute you turn off of Highway 29 into Yountvile you are transported into an idyllic little village and the Vintage Inn just fits into it perfectly with its well manicured grounds pretty flowers and rooms set up in various buildings that each look slightly different all with the feeling of French provincial cottages. We arrived on a Sunday morning around 930 am just to see the property and get the basic check in mechanics handled before departing for a day of wine tasting. The man who was working at the front desk at the time was extremely nice and personable. He gave the feeling that the staff was genuinely delighted that we had arrived and would be staying there for the next two nights. The front desk staff at most hotels is significantly more cold and business like. He was extremely apologetic about the fact that our room was n\u2019t yet ready at 930 am I never would have expected it to be ready anyway and offered to expedite room cleaning for us. Without me even mentioning it he also noted our request for a king bed and confirmed that a king room was available for us. He also encouraged us to take advantage of the hotel \u2019s complimentary breakfast which was set up in the lobby and outside on the patio at the time. We received a call about 90 minutes later to let us know that our room was ready for check in but we did n\u2019t have a chance to go back until around 60 pm. The staff member working at that time was also very nice and I was impressed that after simply mentioning that we had already checked in and that I was there to pick up our room keys she knew who I was and immediately greeted me by name giving the feeling that she had been expecting us. Room. After initially being worried that we were n\u2019t going to get a good room we ended up feeling like we had one of the best rooms at the hotel. We were given a king room on the second floor of one of the buildings closest to the main lobby building overlooking the pool Room 805. We had a great view but also appreciated that we were so close to the lobby for breakfast and afternoon tea although no room is overly far from it. The room itself was just lovely. It was spacious but felt so cozy which was great on the chilly fall evenings that we were there. I highly recommend requesting a room on the second floor since it allowed us to have great vaulted ceilings in the room which contributed even more to the feeling of spaciousness. The only negative to the second floor is that there are no elevators so you \u2019l have to carry luggage up the stairs to get to the room. However that \u2019s a small price to pay. It was obvious that the rooms and bathrooms here are recently renovated and they \u2019ve done a great job of making the updates that really matter like installing new bathroom fixtures and bedding while retaining the classic features that make this hotel unique such as the stone fireplaces in every room comfortable armchairs to sink into and nice area rugs and accessories. The bed was extremely comfortable and nice for sleeping off a day of wine drinking. It was so nice that a complimentary bottle of wine was waiting for us in the room with glasses and a wine opener ours was a cabernet sauvignon from Sonoma and the wood burning fireplace was also easy to operate with a Duraflame log and matches ready to go. I also appreciated the twice daily room cleaning with turndown service as well as some other little things like the nicely sized mini fridge and the separate wifi network for each room with complimentary Internet access. The bathroom was one of my favorite parts of the room. It was very spacious featuring a large vanity with double sinks and plenty of storage for toiletries underneath or on the counter. The L\u2019Ocitane toiletries are a nice treat as well. The floors and all fixtures were clearly recently re done but the piece de resistance of the bathroom was the enormous walk in shower which could literally hold an entire family. There were separate showerheads at either end of the shower which was beautifully finished with white subway tiles all around and very pretty iridescent tiles on the bottom. Overall it was clear that bathrooms had been a focus of the hotel \u2019s renovations and I think it was definitely money well spent. Although the room was very spacious and comfortable it was really nice to also have a separate covered balcony. Our balcony was quite pleasant and large with a nice outdoor couch and chair and a good pool view to one side. Since the hotel is right off of Highway 29 others have commented that the rooms can be loud with traffic noise. We could not hear any traffic noise at all from our room but we could hear it from our balcony. However this noise was n\u2019t significant enough to be much of a bother. I really do n\u2019t have enough good things to say about our room at the Vintage Inn. Our room felt like a really comfortable guest room in someone \u2019s home not a generic hotel room. The only thing I would note is to be aware of leaving windows open in your room. The hotel is designed with all exterior corridors with each room having windows on multiple sides which is really nice for getting plenty of natural light. However it also means you might find something like a big window in your bathroom directly overlooking an exterior corridor. We had this and our housekeeper would always leave it open which was n\u2019t a big deal but we had to make sure to be cognizant to close the window and shutters to avoid being on display to passers by. Grounds Amenities Location As I \u2019ve already mentioned the grounds at the Vintage Inn are wonderfully park like and pretty. There is essentially one main courtyard in the middle that most rooms open out onto which features well manicured landscaping and fountains. It \u2019s a small enough property that you can walk from one end to the other in about two or three minutes and all rooms are relatively convenient to the main parking lot that runs behind the property on the Highway 29 side. I think the Vintage Inn really does have a prime location for touring the Napa Valley. It \u2019s in Yountvile which is both well located and perfectly cute with great restaurants shops and tasting rooms within walking distance. The Vintage Inn is right in the center with world renowned restaurants like the French Laundry less than a block away. The V Marketplace is right across the parking lot and we even went hot air ballooning one morning with a company based there Aloft Napa Valley which was an excellent memorable experience just a couple minutes \u2019 walk away from our room. As far as amenities there is the outdoor pool and hot tub which our room overlooked. The pool area was attractive and would be quite pleasant for swimming during a warmer time of year. I suspect that the pool must be heated since it was open when we were there in November and I saw other guests using it on a couple occasions. I know there is also a fitness center which I believe is located slightly ofsite somewhere between the Vintage Inn and Vilagio. I never ventured over to see it. The dedicated spa for the hotel the Spa Vilagio is over at the Vilago hotel which is about a five minute walk down Washington Street past the V Marketplace and a couple other businesses and parking lots. Dining. Vintage Inn does n\u2019t its own restaurant but it certainly does n\u2019t need to since there are several highly rated and well regarded restaurants in Yountvile within walking distance. We tried Thomas Keller \u2019s Bouchon and had a very pleasant dinner there as well as RD Kitchen for something a bit more casual. Both were quite nice but I thought Bouchon was the better of the two. However the dining that is offered at the Vintage Inn is great. A complimentary hot breakfast is offered to all guests each morning in addition to tea each afternoon. The breakfast is offered in the lobby where the food is attractively displayed right when you walk in with a bunch of tables available to one side. There is also a very attractive outdoor patio right off of the lobby with more seating. We chose to take our breakfast outside each morning since the weather was nice and there was more space outside. It was just lovely sitting out on the patio to start each morning. The food offered on the buffet is really high quality which also impressed me. In addition to Chandon champagne and various juices to make mimosas the breakfast included a large selection of pastries that were quite tasty as well fresh fruit a nice selection of Clover Farms yogurt delicious biscuits with sausage gravy and breakfast potatoes. Outside on the patio a chef was making omelets to order with various toppings and the omelets I had were some of the best I \u2019ve had at a hotel breakfast buffet. As a whole the breakfast here was one of the best I \u2019ve had at a hotel anywhere so it seemed like such a value that it was included in the room rate. The only thing that was disappointing about breakfast was that the made to order waffle station was n\u2019t available everyday. When we stopped in briefly on our check in day a Sunday we did n\u2019t eat too much from the buffet but I noticed that there was a waffle station outside in addition to the omelet station. I was really looking forward to trying a waffle the next two mornings we \u2019d be there but found that the waffles must only be offered on weekends since they were n\u2019t available on Monday or Tuesday. I \u2019m not sure why this would be a weekend only item since the hotel felt no less crowded on Monday or Tuesday when we were there. Regardless the breakfast was just lovely and delicious and I could n\u2019t think of a better way to start our mornings at the Vintage Inn than to enjoy a mimosa and tasty hot breakfast on the patio. We also stopped into the lobby one afternoon to check out the afternoon tea offerings. There is n\u2019t as much offered for afternoon tea but it \u2019s still nice. Lemonade tea cookies and scones are available which we took back with us to our room and enjoyed on the balcony. The afternoon tea felt a little bit sparse in comparison to breakfast but it was a nice feature too. Overall Overall I really have nothing but positive things to say about the Vintage Inn. It \u2019s a small hotel that is well run and well maintained. The rooms are spacious nicely decorated and comfortable. We could not have felt happier with our decision to stay here as it contributed in a positive way to a couple of wonderful days in the Napa Valley. We enjoyed starting each day with breakfast at the hotel and ending each day walking to dinners in quaint Yountvile. I really did n\u2019t want to leave when our two night stay was over. Definitely do not hesitate to stay here \u2013 you wo n\u2019t be disappointed.", "offset": [11326, 11444], "date": "2017-01-03", "cpt": "0", "category": "restaurant"}, {"id": 10, "uid": "2c7fb5d0-c739-4b92-8773-49bc671e2d9b", "sentence": "A previous gem in the middle of construction.

The reason that I stayed at the Vintage Inn in the past is that it seemed to offer a lot for the money. That is most certainly no longer the case. In fact I would say that it is a very poor value. To start there are some positives. The location is fabulous. The rooms have recently been remodeled. The bathroom is lovely. The rooms are quite large. However there are some weird parts. The makeup mirror has been placed at a level only a really short person could use. The really nice Nespreso machines have been replaced with Keurig machines cost cut. Before leaving I checked the website to see if they still used LOcitane products in the bathrooms. The website said that they did. That is simply not true. Two months ago the hotel changed to Espa. Seriously. The website still has not been updated. Yet another example of cost cutting. As for the fabric on the new love seat and the chair. Shiny cheap velvet that looks like it should be in a 1970s disco. Speaking of cost cutting the breakfast. Each and every time I stayed at the Vintage Inn a big part of the attraction was the fabulous breakfast. omelet station cured meats cheeses different quiches boiled eggs smoked salmon with all the fixings bacon and sausage berries etc. Oh how the mighty have fallen. I have described the current breakfast offerings to my friends as Hampton Inn esque slop. The omelet station is gone because of construction there are none of the other items I just listed and the replacements are awful industrial scrambled eggs sausage gravy with cold biscuits bad fruit. It is just awful. I asked if I could go to the Vilagio for their breakfast wrongly assuming that the construction was the only cause of the lack of nice choices and was told I could go there. Notice the hotel did not inform me that I could go there for omelets I had to ask. Well the Vilagio which has the same owners has the same Hampton Inn esque slop. It is such a disappointment after knowing what the previous owners served for breakfast. A new guest may not find it so awful but any guest of the old owners will be sorely disappointed. Yet another example of the new owners cost cutting. On our third day we just went across the street to Bouchon Bakery for breakfast for which we paid 250. This should not have to be done when you are paying for breakfast as part of your hotel cost. Now onto the construction. I made my initial reservations online with the hotels website. I called at least twice to make changes to the reservations. Neither on the website nor over the phone was I ever notified of the construction that is affecting the property. The property is partially surrounded by chainlink fence covered in green mesh the pool is being rebuilt and the lobby is gone. Because of the construction you have to either walk down the street in your swimsuit and coverup to use the Vilagio pool or drive there. The website states that the Vintage Inn has a pool. That is simply not true. The breakfast which was previously in a large part of the lobby is now in a separate building next door. For this I paid 48 for two of my four nights. In no way was it worth this. I was told that an email should have been sent to me about the construction. Well they never sent it to me and they have never updated their website to inform guests about the major construction that is going on until July August. The hotel has been bought by a private equity hotel group Thayer. Thayer has made many many cost cuts. Besides the cost cuts they fired many of the employees by letter and then rehired them two days later. If someone from management is reading this review they might ask themselves well why did not she say something when she was checking out. The reason I did not is because upon checkout no one asked how my stay was. I certainly would have told them that the lack of notification about the construction the lack of a pool the poor poor breakfast and the downgrade of amenities made me regret staying there and spending what I did. From now on we will stay at either the North Block Hotel or the Hotel Yountvile. I am giving the hotel two stars because of the great location and the clean rooms.", "offset": [2365, 2467], "date": "2017-06-15", "cpt": "1", "category": "restaurant"}, {"id": 17, "uid": "ab7a802b-4d28-4576-968a-31fc41dec2e3", "sentence": "Anniversary getaway.

We have stayed at Vintage Inn for the past 28 years of an annual sisters daughter in law trip. Last year was a total bust due to change in ownership renovation and we almost did not return to Vintage Inn House this year. I am so glad we did. The rooms were completed and lovely the wine fridge was filled with honor bar items so there was no room to chill our wines. Noise is still an issue due to traffic. We could see daylight around the door of the room so perhaps some insulation would help with that. The staff was over the top wonderful and the grounds as always were beautiful. The new lobby leaves me a bit cold but will appeal to those who appreciate modern decor. Breakfast was comprised of scrambled eggs oatmeal pastries charcuterie smoked salmon bagels spreads capers fresh tomatoes and fruit. Gone are the omelette bar potatoes specialty eggs dishes and champagne. Also gone is the afternoon tea and wine tasting or bar service which I have heard is only available on weekends.
