A ground floor 2 bedroom lagoon suite cost us 340 for 6 nights. This included full buffet breakfast for 5 of us every day. We looked at other comparable accommodation on the coast at this time of year and the average is about 40 with no breakfast. Value is actually great because you get so much more than just accommodation. As an Acor Advantage Plus member this is the only hotel I have stayed at where I was actually made to feel like a VIP. The grounds are enormous and beautifully maintained. The beach is at one end of the resort with patrolled flags the lagoon is in the middle and the river is at the other end for fishing. Every year we load up the car with scooters skateboards fishing rods boogie boards and board games and head up to Twin Waters. The kids pre teens teen have a ball meeting new friends on the free water trampoline and kayaks. The inflatable water park is new and not free. We checked the pricing before we went and allowed our kids a budget of 3 sessions each during our 6 day stay. They were happy with this. it is a shame it is right in front of Activity Central though. This used to be a lovely play area for young families in the shallow water and it made for a beautiful view of the lake. Unfortunately the water park commercialises this area. it is great but would be better moved down to another cove area where it is not right in your view. Dining options are a bit expensive on site if you have a big family. We can recommend North Shore Seafoods 5 minute drive for fish and chips and the local Friendly Grocer 3 minute drive for burgers. If you have the opportunity to do the 90 minute timeshare talk they are currently giving you a 150 credit to thank you for your listening time. This can be used against all the incidentals on your hotel bill so worth it to cover the costs of the water park and restaurants. We love this place it suits our family at this stage of our life and we are already looking forward to Christmas 2015.", "offset": [1353, 1452], "date": "2015-01-05 00:00:00", "cpt": "0", "category": "room"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "448baa45-f43d-4a70-ad05-5151ceb3a323", "sentence": "Great place for kids adults alike to enjoy fun in the sun.

The service was terrible. The floor manager should be fired you ask him for assistance with something and he says he will do something but he just walks off. We ve ordered drinks that never arrived so we ve had to and get them ourselves we ve had to chase waiters down to clear our table. 75 p p is definatley overpriced for the quality and the service.

We booked our room in order to cut our trip to Rainbow beach. the next day into a more manageable drive and selected Twin Waters as an overnight stopover as we have stayed here previously with our children. We were welcomed and allowed to check in early which we all appreciated after driving for the morning. Our room was quite far from the main reception and on check in we were. told if we ever needed a lift in a golf buggy due to the distance just ask. We have young children so walking back and forth involved us carrying them on each occasion. Our children also get excited when they see golf buggies as they often request lift when they see a golf buggy at other resorts. The two occasions I asked golf buggy drivers which had no passengers in them for a lift to our room I was told no sorry. I found. this disappointing as the first time we had walked a whole loop around the lake and the second time it was lightly raining. We noticed our room was quite old but had been refurbished over the years and the bottle of wine and cheese platter was delightful on arrival. We turned the air conditioning to commence cooling the room and went straight to enjoy the resort activities as we only had the afternoon to use them. After an exhausting afternoon and dinner we put our children to bed and watched some television and had a spa bath. It was only when we attempted to sleep we noticed how noisy the air conditioning system was. We attempted to turn it off and on again to see if the noisy rattling would stop and it did stop for a while. We continued to try to sleep and was n\u2019t long before the rattling commenced again. We discussed asking reception for maintenance however with the children asleep and time of night we both agreed we would be best to just turn it off. It was n\u2019t long before we were both hot and annoyed and had to turn the system back on in order to get comfortable. The system continued to rattle all night right above the bathroom next to the bedroom. In hindsight we probably should have requested a room change in the middle of the night however with our children asleep we did not even think about this at the time. We had to be up early as we had to be on the road by 70am on Sunday and we were both glad when our alarm went off as we had just been watching our clocks all night waiting for the alarm to go off so we could wake our boys. We were both quite disappointed as we booked the room in order to be refreshed for our drive to Rainbow beach in the morning yet we were both lying awake most of the night. We both felt we would have been better just driving from home instead of staying as this would have saved us quite a bit of money and we actually would have been less fatigued. We have stayed at the resort previously with our family and friends and have always felt the service and experience was extremely personalised. It was a shame that this trip has left us both feeling unimpressed and. questioning if we would return again.

When in bath i could see cleaning in bathroom was not good enough tiles lower down and grouting extremely dirty and grubby floor was disguisting. 4. No toilet brush husband was nt well and i wanted to clean toilet. 5. had brought nibbles to eat in room but no plates or cutlery asked at reception they said ring room service. no number could not get through. 6. breakfast plates were cold in plate heater but not turned on. so by time got breakfast and got back to a table food was cold so not edible. 7 was not happy with barmans attitude at wedding reception. he was extremely rude He decided at one stage only one drink would be served per person his answer was too many drunken people around. there was not one drunken person around loud yes but the new zealand lot are loud without drink. but allowed at a wedding. Our table were all older people and none of us were drunk at all Anyway i was on crutches due to a tumour being removed from inside my leg and my husband wanted to get me a drink and himself one and he explained that to the bar man even pointed me out so i could wave the crutches at him and he refused to listen or look said i had to come up myself so i did nt bother cos it was too painful Even the brides parents who were paying and definately were nt drunk could nt get two drinks. was it the hotels way of cutting down how much they served to save money. we think so heard night before at bar package deal was ridiculous as not enough people serving so queues were ridiculous again a way of cutting down how much people drank. Now do nt get me wrong i undestand its a hotel you do nt want drunk people all over the place but the wedding was not a drunken brawl as barman had implied. we have two daughters one who is getting married next year and as i had said in a previous email to you we were looking at your hotel as a place to host her wedding for 200 people and maybe two years later the other daughter But now will be looking at other places Which is a shame because the setting is perfect. It was not a cheap room and restaurant prices are extremely high for what you get we had a pizza at grab and go not a good standard at all.

The room was as described and expected and enjoyed by the entire family. Additional blankets for childrens fold out bed were difficult to obtain when phoning to request. TV picture and sound was very intermittent on Free to air channels with constant pixelation and sound squawks making those channels unwatchable. Foxtel channels appeared to not be affected so we were limited to watching those channels. Water activities and facilities for the kids were very great and enjoyed by us all. Our only disappointment was that the Inflatable Activity Park although being directly outside our room and alongside the other facilities in the same lagoon were not included activities and required additional payment. When we asked why we were told that they were a separate private business operating within the resort. It was alluded to within the photos on your website and during the booking process that this was included and during check in we were told whilst pointing to a map that all activities within these areas were included whilst wearing the supplied green armbands. More annoying particularly once we were told that this was a private enterprise operating within the resort was the noise and exhaust fumes from a generator pump situated on a pontoon adjacent to our room. This generator appeared to operate non stop for the entire time that the Inflatable Activities were in operation. The noise and fumes from this meant that we could not enjoy any of the facilities in our room until they ceased trading late in the afternoon. Whilst I understand the obvious mechanical and practical need for this device to operate surely it could be located further away from guest rooms so as to provide the amenity that we were paying for. Without even looking too far simply on the opposite side of the Inflatable Activities there was plenty of open water between the shore and the walkway over to your other over water function room. Food at the Aqua Bar was very good and delicious on Friday evening. However we were very disappointed and felt misled after booking for lunch for the advertised Asian Wok amp. Dim Sum. Of the seven listed items From the Basket which were the main reason we were enticed to go only two were provided. When questioning the staff we were directed to the fine print on the menu stating that Menu subject to change due to availability of produce. At a premium resort such as yours I find it impossible to believe that you were unable to source produce to provide the following as advertised Vegetable Lotus Seafood Dumplings Prawn Goza Peking Duck Wanton or Shao Mai. Furthermore the other meals presented in Woks may have been initially stirfried and hot but were left stewing and kept warm for what appeared excessive time as when we tried these they were lukewarm and unappetising. After the lovely food provided on Friday evening in a bar we expected even better and more for the price in your premium restaurant but were sadly disappointed. The Breakfast Buffet was as expected and enjoyed both mornings. Our final night we purchased pizzas and Wedges from Grab and Go and took back to our room to eat as we were not keen to try Nouveau Restaurant again. One of the pizzas was quite nice however the other had topping only covering the approximately 50 of the pizza base. Over the weekend about half your staff that we dealt with gave the level of service and attention expected in a Family oriented Resort facility such as yours and were very good. Whilst none of the others were rude that other half literally ignored us or turned and walked away even after making eye contact or if they did attend to us were generally just doing their job with feeling that their either cared or wanted to be there. As paying customers we do not expect to be waited on like royalty but do expect polite acknowledgement and service at all times. So in conclusion the room water based activities 3 out of 5 meals and about half of your staff were very good. If that were our entire stay we would rate overall at 9 ie what you did well was very good and we felt we received good value for money. However the very disappointing lunch at Nouveau Restaurant poorly prepared takeaway pizza exhaust fumes and noise from the generator bad TV performance and the mediocre customer service provided by approximately half of the staff with whom we had contact drags our overall rating back to 5 ie you and your staff did not get everything right and this unfortunately outweighed the good that the others did. That 40 drop in overall score is directly proportional to the value that we felt we received for the money paid.", "offset": [0, 145], "date": "2017-07-11 06:52:03", "cpt": "1", "category": "room"}, {"id": 19, "uid": "66f033ef-c6f3-4e82-a0d9-3b35b22b1f17", "sentence": "We did not enjoy our stay as the room were dirty and old.", "offset": [0, 57], "date": "2017-07-15 00:00:00", "cpt": "1", "category": "room"}, {"id": 20, "uid": "de879602-9c88-4884-a8f4-bc2576176fc9", "sentence": "Room acceptable.
