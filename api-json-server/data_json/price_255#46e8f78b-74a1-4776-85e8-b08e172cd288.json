We were nervous about staying in Oakland but were pleasantly surprised at how charming and safe the area was. The staff was more than friendly. The location was perfect. We enjoyed being waking distance to the ferry. This allowed us to stay close to the wedding location but also allowed us easy access to San Francisco. Our room was spacious and lovely. We requested a crib for our daughter which was there upon arrival. The large room allowed us plenty of space for the crib and for playing with our daughter without feeling cramped. I would stay here again. It was family friendly and not too expensive.", "offset": [632, 677], "date": "2015-01-31", "cpt": "0", "category": "price"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "2aa567c1-1497-4f3e-b99b-1c7886b3ee65", "sentence": "Charming unusual scenic. I have stayed at the Waterfront Hotel four times occupying rooms in three tier levels. city view balcony with harbor view and deluxe suite. The hotel is located in Jack London Square and a 5 minute walk from the Oakland Amtrak station. Restaurants abound nearby. it is a nautical themed hotel throughout and right on the harbor. The San Francisco ferry is on or nearly on the property. Valet parking is available. I strongly advise paying a little more to obtain a harbor view room with balcony. My room was spacious with every expected amenity plus two sinks and a wet bar. The view across the harbor to San Francisco is wonderful especially at sunset. The suites are worth every dollar and highly recommended. The only downside is that nearby train traffic can be disturbing to those occupying city view rooms. This is much less of an issue with those in the west facing rooms. Bus stops are across the street from the hotel free shuttle service on weekdays up and down Broadway and BART stations are within reasonable walking distance. Service is superb. I called the front desk to ask about a transportation issue I was asked where I wanted to go and within 5 minutes a gentleman appeared at my door with a map and BART schedule.

The location A fabulous spot. Jack London Square is lovely. The kids had a great time on the ferry across to Pier 39 close to Fishermans Wharf and Alcatraz Pier. Plenty of varied eating in Jack London nice restruants but as a family we chose Plank which is like a beer garden and had great service and food. The hotel room Very nice place to stay and we appreciated the extra room family of 4. We were given a disabled suite which had 2 tvs and a seperate lounge area. fabulous as we have been travelling for 4 weeks. The service was friendly room was quiet clean and well appointed. Valet Parking. This was my negative. For two nights we paid more than 500 and then got slugged an extra 50 for parking. When I booked there was no mention of valet parking. it was parking available. Not happy about this especially considering our car was moved 20 metres and there it stayed until we checked out.

I thought this was going to be a nice hotel on the waterfront. The picture posted is the front of the hotel where the restaurant is located. We checked in at the back of the hotel. As we approached the hotel we were greeted by the valet person. He quickly told us that it would be an additional 32 per night to park. He seemed annoyed that we might to park it first and check in and unload. The funny thing is he ended up parking our car 10 feet from where we left it to unload our stuff. When we asked if we could check it in and out he said yes but that they had plenty of restaurants nearby if we wanted to walk. I got the impression that once he parked it he did not want to get it again if he had too. I was thinking they must store them somewhere else. But like I said it was funny that it was parked right outside the door. We had to wait for 10 minutes to get checked in although two people were at the front desk. Once we got to our room we were disappointed. For a 300 per night hotel. we got nothing better than a Super 8. The room smelled funny. Our balcony overlooked the valet parking lot and entrance to the hotel. The good thing was I could see my car. It was dirty and the city view was of a parking garage and a highway. Ridiculous. I called down to see if we could get a better room but she could not offer me anything. I thought this was strange for a Tuesday night. Surely they had better rooms available.

For her that is very scary feeling isolated from help if needed. Plus every time we came with the car to drop her off or pick her up we had to explain the need to drive through the valet parking to the valets.
