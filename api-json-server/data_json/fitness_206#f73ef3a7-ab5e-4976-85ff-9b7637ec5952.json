On a recent trip NYC I had the good fortune to spend three nights at the hotel. Central Park is directly across the street and easily accessible. it is Manhattan so there is plenty of shopping and restaurants. Had Club Level access which is on the second floor and looks directly into Central Park. it is a great place to hang out until the shoppers in ones life return.

Stayed here for a couple of nights pre Christmas. Great location on South Central Park. Generous sized room and bathroom but no view. I paid using Mariot points and cash and had selected the lowest tiered room. Used the spa which was nice. The gym was very small and does not seem like it was custom designed more that it was the only available space to put the gym equipment. It is an L shaped room and not very wide so not a lot of space. Had afternoon tea there also and was disappointed in the service. Whilst the food was good they kept the tea pots off the table as they want to pour it themselves. that is fair enough but they really ought to be faster. I was finishing courses with an empty cup sitting in front of me. First world problems I know but the service just was not right. My other complaint also involves tea. There was no teamaking facility in the room there was for coffee. and so I asked for boiling water and a tea bag. They brought it alright but it was accompanied with a 12 charge. That one really annoyed me. 12 for boiling water and a teabag just is not right especially when you consider what the hotel costs. Staff overall were great. Door staff were especially helpful and courteous. Pre Christmas there was warm apple cider and cookies in the reception which were a great way to warm up when returning to the hotelit is a classic hotel and I would stay here again despite the minor flaws I have pointed out.", "offset": [268, 404], "date": "2015-04-27", "cpt": "0", "category": "fitness"}, {"id": 4, "uid": "88f46553-7c1c-4d06-91e8-4a59fed9efcc", "sentence": "Disappointed in our room. I booked into the deluxe club room and with my gold status I had hoped for an upgrade. I did not get an upgrade which is the risk you take. The only issue I have is that the view 2 windows to a central roof exhaust area was simply disgusting. I wish I had known just how bad the view was so I could have reserved for at least a city view but it was too late none available. Word of warning these rooms are not worth the rate. Pros. Great location easy access to Central Park and subway. Bed was comfortable room was clean great housekeeping service although there is not a nespreso machine in the room and the club only has coffee for the breakfast service otherwise you have to ask for a coffee. Good size room 425 sqft and bathroom was large with separate tub shower and great amenities water pressure was ok. Offer afternoon tea in the club and it was lovely great English scones with clotted cream. The fitness center was clean and had what I needed for my workout. The staff was friendly. No problems with wifi but I am not a huge user during vacation. Cons Club The food presentations in the club were the same for all three days that we were there. They only have wine water soda and tea out for self pour otherwise you have to ask one of the attendants for any other drink including a cordial or coffee after dinner. Worst Ritz Club candy cart ever. We had to haul our luggage through the two entry doors which are heavy glass no bellman in site. No pool and one steam room in the spa. The relaxation room is immediately outside of the treatment rooms so it could be a little awkward going in out or possibly noisy if a couple chatty ladies are waiting. Our dinner at Auden Bistro was meh the sushi flatbread was good but the monkfish was a bit tough and really tasteless. I do not know this for sure but I am guessing that they are preparing for a renovation in the very near future. You get the feeling that they are just trying to get by with what they have and will not go out of their way to improve what is currently available. They may be a little under staffed. If you desire to have a luxury stay near Central Park I would have to recommend Mandarin Oriental at this time even though I am a RC fan.

I generally like the Ritz Carlton as they usually have found a way to delight us. This time they did manage to get us a table at Ralph Laurens Polo Bar which is not easy. This particular property has been high on my list as it is located next to the Central Park and views from the Park View rooms are simply amazing. Otherwise this location has started to deliver mixed service standards mainly in Food Beverage Area. I always stay at the club level and I found that the service level had really dropped drastically since my last visit few years ago. The presentations during cocktail hours were very poor from variety perspective and the breakfast was kind of disappointing as well. Lunch and Afternoon tea service was pretty nice. We also tried the room service once and the food was less then innovative. In the lounge the staff was not very proactive for example they did not ask during the breakfast if we would like to have cappuccino and during the cocktail hours guest had to go to the kitchen to ask if they could have a drink as the staff was not managing the tables. Generally only the person at the concierge desk said something to us. Others did seem pretty much tuned out. Usually the Ritz have had employees at the main doors in uniforms to greet guests when they leave and return to the property. This time they did not have them there. Few times some employees without uniform were opening the doors and I was not really sure if they worked there or not. Few times we sat down in the lobby bar and there were people working behind the bar but nobody came over to us to ask if we wanted to have a drink or something. It pretty much seemed that they did not have proper amount of staff in duty during the evenings. Overall it looks like attention to detail mainly at the Club Lounges is something that some Ritz Carlton hotels like this one have started to fall behind and sometimes for this reason the better choice from price to service ratio perspective could be to stay in other Mariot brand hotels like the Edition or JW Mariot or maybe even outside the family in the Peninsula or the Four Seasons.

Located in upper Manhattan right opposite Central Park the Ritz Carlton is the best way to treat yourself whilst in New York City. From the moment you set foot into the hotel you are welcomed by courteous polite and smiling staff who will take your luggage and escort you to reception. After check in concierge will escort you to your room. This was actually a really nice touch after a long flight and nightmare journey in due to traffic the man who took us to our room was really friendly and chatty and i though it made for a very warming welcome without being too much. Our room was on the 9th floor and had a side view on Central Park and the opposite building. I believe there are higher rooms with a full view of the park though that did not really bother me. In terms of size the room was very spacious including a super comfortable and large double bed marble bathroom with walk in shower and a separate toilet. Room also has a minibar TV and benefits from turn down service every night. The decor of the room and the hotel in general is very upscale and classy though it all looks a bit 90s though everything is very well kept and not tired looking. I think the hotel would just benefit from a little refreshThe hotel restaurant is amazing staff are so polite and welcoming and the food is fantastic albeit rather pricey. A breakfast for two can cost you over 150There is also a small gym onsite equipped with weights machines and treadmills which is always a bonus unfortunately there are no spa facilities but that really was not an issue for me.
