This is actually an excellent hotel overall and its proximity to California Adventure and Disneyland makes it the perfect choice if you are going to the parks and can afford it. But for 300 plus per night during the LOW season they should provide better heating and cooling control in the rooms. Because they did not do that we slept badly two out of our three nights there. So bottom line if you are not sensitive about the temperature of your room I recommend this hotel it is very pretty in a Yosemite ish way has a really fun slide on one of its three pools and it is just so convenient to be right next to both the theme parks and the Downtown Disney shopping area. there is lots of decent to good food available both at the hotel and at Downtown Disney though of course it is all very expensive. There is a small fridge in the room if you are organized enough to bring some of your own food. Our room was clean and our bed was comfortable. Now for the climate system story. Apparently the rooms climate control is on a motion sensor so no matter what you set it to it stops working when there is no movement in the room. That makes sense when guests are out for the day but it means that the heating and cooling stop working while you sleep. As a result I woke up way too hot the middle of our first night there. After looking around on the internet to see if I could bypass the system on my own I ended up calling the desk at 430 in the morning. They sent up a technician who noted that cool air was coming out of the vents yes that is because I have been MOVING AROUND awake for the past 40 minutes. He pressed and held the button on the left that toggles Celcius Fahrenheit until the display showed bp presumably for bypass. He said that would work for 30 hours. I guess it did the next night we were comfortable. The third night thinking I now knew how to bypass the motion control I pressed the C F button until bp appeared and went to bed confident. In an unrelated occurrence both my husband and I woke up at 30 AM to a weird noise nearby like something dropping rocks in a room near ours. It stopped after 15 minutes or so. We woke up HOT again at 60 AM. I guess the button pushing was not the whole story. Fuming I finally got up and complained to the night manager at 630. So the bad news is that two our of three days we got crummy sleep. The good news is that the manager comped us one of those expensive nights due to my complaint. Also since we were up early anyway we took advantage of the early entry to California Adventure on the last day of our visit which turned out to be a fantastic idea. I understand why hotels want to use motion sensors and avoid heating or cooling rooms when no one is in there. But overnight. They should either disable motion control from say 10 PM to 6 AM or put a prominent sign in each room saying that they save energy by using motion control but making it clear and easy for the guests to have it turned off overnight if they wish.", "offset": [1018, 1164], "date": "2015-01-09", "cpt": "0", "category": "room"}, {"id": 2, "uid": "b6615b9f-b7e8-4bad-8b41-2f9d65cf98da", "sentence": "Outstanding location. it is all about the convenient location and easy access to both parks but you pay a very hefty price for it.

Our Expedia dates got mixed up so we ended up in the lobby for half an hour or so getting situated the hotel gave us some fast passes to compensate and a room upgrade to compensate so were pleased with how it was handled. Only has access to the California Adventure Park with magic mornings on Sunday. Had we not had the snafu with the room we could have enjoyed more of the Disneyland Park on Saturday.

Amazing pool area with several pools and sun beds with really really comfortable mattresses. Some of the staff is grumpy and not that helpful but most members of the staff is wonderful. Apart from dry cleaning services the hotel offers laundry rooms where you can wash your clothes for only 3 dollars card only. Expect some waiting time though.

This is my third time staying at the Grand Californian in Anaheim. The hotel is very expensive for what you get but it is my preferred place to stay simply because it is so close to the parks. PROS. As I mentioned above this hotel is very close to Disneyland and California Adventure. If you need to grab a nap or even just a coat distance is not a detractorDisney service is wonderful. I have found that Anaheim hotels are not necessarily service focused people are always going to stay near Disneyland right. so it is a refreshing difference with any Disneyland hotelThe rooms are thoughtfully laid out especially for families. The toilet and shower are separate from the double sink vanity. There are two other mirrors in the room too so it seems like a whole family could be getting ready pretty efficiently. CONS. The noise from the room next door is pretty bad. You can hear babies crying and normal volume conversations as if they were in your romThere are not enough electrical outlets in the room especially near the bed which is where I like to charge my phone. Even one of those lamps with outlets would help matersThe decor can use a bit of freshening up torn wallpaper eg. I know they are renovating in 2017 and I hope that solves this issue. Overall even considering the price I think the Grand is great. A Disney vacation can be really stressful what with all the walking and the crowds and staying so close to the parks can really help matters.

First this hotel is under major reconstruction remodel summer 2017. Second we drove 15 hours and checked in tired. Third we paid for a view and asked for a wheelchair accessible room. Lastly bottom line all the rooms are large enough to accommodate a wheel chair however not all rooms come with a view and the so called Disney accessible rooms from our experience are tight small and there is no view closeted. do not ask for an accessible room they all come with step in tubs and or a roll in shower BUT not a view. If you ask and pay for a view even if you are requesting an accessible room then you should get an accessible room with a view be assertive. They have everything you want and more you pay you get be assertive. We checked in early Sunday for our 3 night stay the view from our first accessible room overlooked a shingled rooftop and our sliding bathroom door was broken off the hinges and the room smelled like exhaust from the exhaust pipes outside our patio view rooftop view. The accessible room was broken small not really wheel chair accessible dusty had no view and smelled of exhaust. We called and asked the front desk if there was an accessible room with a view and a working bathroom door. She said does it have to be accessible. Go figure. Pleasantly surprised the magical front desk clerk happily and promptly moved us two floors up and our room with a patio overlooked three pools and the nightly Mickey Color Show Feris Wheel. This is the place to stay. We paid two queen beds 712 per night the city of Anahiem has a room tax that is out of this world. Worth every penny. We had the best time ever.

We stayed the first week of June in a one bedroom vacation club villas. The stay as always was fantastic. The staff the pool the lobby everything about this hotel is 5 star. From the moment you drive up and have someone open your car door greeting you you quickly realize this truly is a 5 star experience. This is our favorite Disney hotel. Everything about the stay here is magical. If you can afford the little extra money I recommend staying here at least one time. It is well worth it. The room we stayed in is for Disney vacation club members so as far I know it is not available to everyone. The room was great lots of room for everyone. Having the full kitchen was awesome to be able to cook meals and having a full size refrigerator was so nice. We were able to fill it with water sodas etc for our whole trip. Also there is BQs available for vacation club members. If you stay in the vacation club villas if your able to try and get a room on the fourth or fifth floor. These floors seem to give you the best view of California adventure park. When they World of Color is up and running on the fifth floor of the vacation club villas there is an area where you can watch the show. There is heaters to keep you warm if it is cold and a bathroom to use. A perk available to anyone staying at the hotel is early entry into the parks. Now the early entry into Disneyland is also offered to people buying certain tickets etc so there is more people on those days. The early entry to California Adventure was only available to Disney hotel guests. I highly recommend taking advantage of the early entry into California Adventure because there is not many people in there. I think the only ride you could not get on early was Guardians of the Galaxy mission break out. You need to check with the hotel staff because I am sure that has changed with Pixar Pier opening up there might be some restrictions for that new area. It was great we went in early there was not many people there so we kind of felt like the park was opened just for us. Another perk offered at the hotel is a walk through the park in the morning as an exercise group. Only draw back was we had to be at the hotel entrance to the park at 545 am. It was worth it. We got to see the park before it opened it was nice and peaceful. The walk is not super fast at all and pretty easy pace for sure. You can not take any pictures while you are on your walk but there is two people who walk with you who will give you lots of information and answer whatever questions you have. To book the walk just stop by in the hotel lobby at guest services and they will help you out. They were super friendly the whole time we were there. We ate at Story Tellers restaurant while we were there. They offer a regular menu and they have a buffet. The buffet was excellent with a great selection of food and desserts. The quality of the food and presentation was very good. If you have any food allergies or concerns the staff will be glad to help you out and even have a chef come out and talk to you about how the food is prepared. We did not go to Napa Rose to eat this time but if you are looking for a place to have a five star meal this is the place to go. It is very fine dining a great place for an anniversary dinner or even a marriage proposal. Number one fine dining restaurant in the area in my opinion. The fact the hotel is so close to both parks is very nice especially for any trips back to the room to take a break at the pool or take a nap. The pool area is very big with 3 separate pools and a small kidie pool for kids to walk and play in. They have a water slide and even have a small slide for the little ones. There is complimentary water located around the pool area as well as complimentary sunblock life jackets and swim diapers for the kids. There is life guards on duty all day until the evening. White water snacks is located right next to the pool and has a great selection of burgers pizzas nachos etc. In the morning when I was there they had complimentary coffee not sure if they have that all the time. The gift shop in the lobby is a little treasure. We always seem to find what we are looking for there if we ca nt find it in the park. They have a nice selection of hotel themed gifts as well as Disney themed items. They also have some basic essentials and snack items. They even have a small selection of wine. Getting to downtown Disney or going into the park. If you have not been to Disneyland in awhile then you may not be aware of the security check points. To get into Downtown Disney when you leave the hotel you have to go through a security check point. The same goes for leaving the hotel going directly into California adventure park. Just be ready ahead of time and it will go a little smoother. If you have a bag of any any kind unzip it and have the compartments open so they can look inside when you reach the security officer. Self parking for the hotel is across the street but they do offer valet parking. If you are going to self park and your checking in they do have a 20 minute parking area just asked one of the employees they will show you. The Downtown Disney area is under going construction in the area between Disneyland Hotel and the monorail. They are building another hotel so ESPN restaurant the movie theater Starbucks Earl of Sandwich and Rain Forest Cafe are all closed down. If your trying to chose between the Disney Hotels in my opinion I think this is the best one but the Disneyland Hotel is a close second. I really like how everything is centrally located in the Grand Californian and the lobby is so beautiful. So if your willing the pay the extra money this is the hotel to stay but you ca nt go wrong if you stay at any of the Disney hotels.

Over the past several years I have written a number of these \u201c practical review \u201d to Disney Hotels and considering the number of \u201c helpful \u201d votes I \u2019ve earned 195 on 5 reviews so far and the number of emails I have received from people asking for advice on their upcoming vacations I think it \u2019s fair to say I \u2019m pretty good at it. As such this review will be in the same tone. I will not drone on about how Disney is the most magical place on Earth and can do no wrong. Instead I am going to focus on the major points of Disney \u2019s Grand Californian Resort and Spa hereinafter GC in order to help anyone who chooses to read this be better informed before they spend a small fortune on a hotel room. This is the part where I normally tell readers to feel free to email me with questions about their upcoming trip to Disney World but as this was only my second trip to Disneyland as opposed to 50 to Disney World I do n\u2019t think I would have a ton of insight to give but if you want to ask me a question feel free. I \u2019m always happy to help or at least try. As per my previous posts this will be broken down into subsections for easier comprehension. Layout and ThemeDG has a woodsy National Park Lodge theme and it is done to perfection. I have stayed in over 30 Disney Hotels in Paris Orlando Anaheim and Oahu and I can say without a doubt this is the nicest most luxurious Disney Hotel I \u2019ve ever stepped foot inside let alone stayed at. All of the rooms are located within the same central building with interior corridors leading off of a main central atrium that rises the entire 6 stories as opposed to many of Disney \u2019s hotels wherein there are various out buildings housing guest rooms. There is one central elevator in the center of the massive and intricately decorated lobby that serves the entire hotel which made it very convenient to get to your room. However if you book a room with a theme park or Downtown Disney view it \u2019s going to be a long walk down these hallways to get to your room. Also I might add that GC has a private entrance to Disney \u2019s California Adventure Park that lets you walk in less than 100 yards from Sorin Around the World my Wife \u2019s favorite ride and this entrance is only for Disney Hotel Guests. So if you want to \u201c rope drop \u201d the park you will have an easier time staying at the GC than you would utilizing the main entrance as the number of people you will have to push through will be next to zero. As I \u2019l get into more below this convenience is about the only advantage to staying at a Disney hotel in Anaheim and it \u2019s not even that great of an advantage considering how close all of the \u201c good neighbor \u201d hotels are located to the parks. The GC also has a private entrance that puts you right in the middle of the Downtown Disney area which is only about a 200 yard walk to the main gate for Disneyland Park. StafI always through a section in about the staff in case any of their bosses are reading this just so they know the staff at the DC was perfect as we \u2019ve all come to expect from Disney employees with an extra special acknowledgement of whomever played Minie Mouse at the Storyteller \u2019s Caf\u00e9 Character Breakfast more on that belowDiningThere were several dining options at GC of which I only tried 2. Hearthstone Lounge is a bar but family friendly that is open for breakfast lunch and dinner as well as well as drinks. We had breakfast there and it was fine. Nothing special exactly what you would expect from a quick style restaurant. We also had dinner there and the pizza was large enough to feed the 4 of us with little difficulty. The lunch dinner menu was not particularly impressive but I think they are meant to be more bar snacks than an actual meal but either way it worked for us. We also ate at the \u201c. Mickey \u2019s Tales of Adventure Breakfast \u201d at the Storyteller \u2019s Caf\u00e9. This is your standard character buffet you will find in just about every deluxe Disney resort around the world. The food is exactly what you would expect from a buffet at a family restaurant for breakfast. Omelet chef Mickey waffles bacon eggs sausage etc. All in all the food was as good as can be expected. What made the meal for me and what justified the 1500 price tag for 4 people was the character interaction. This is the only character meal at Disneyland featuring Mickey Mouse. In fact it featured Mickey Minie Pluto Chip and Dale. I have been to every character meal offered at Disney World and I can say that I have never had a character interaction like we had with Minie Mouse. My almost 3 year old daughter talked about meeting Minie for weeks leading up to our trip. When we first got to Storyteller \u2019s Pluto came right up to us and my daughter had a meltdown crying her eyes out. I \u2019ve never seen her that scared in her entire life. So after my son almost 5 got to meet Pluto he moved on and here comes Minie. Again my daughter was terrified but Minie spent about 15 minutes with us getting closer and closer and trying to cheer my daughter up and by the time she left my daughter was hugging her. Normally you are lucky to get 1 minute with a character. She stayed with us for a full 15 minutes just to make my daughter happy. That ladies and gentlemen is why Disney is worth the money. As far as other dining options Napa Rose is the \u201c signature restaurant \u201d at GC. While I did not get to eat there not the kind of place you want to take a 4 and 2 year old I passed by it several times and was able to look inside and read the menu. If you can get past the price it looks like it would be a phenomenal dining experience. The RomThey were hotel rooms. There is n\u2019t much else to say about them. You \u2019ve got beds a shower and a toilet. You sleep and change there. That \u2019s it. I often read reviews where people complain about the quality of the room which I \u2019ve never really understood. The vast majority of all hotel rooms across America look pretty much the same. These seemed slightly bigger than a standard hotel room with a couch that transformed into a bed not a pull out it \u2019s hard to describe think of a Murphy bed meets a pull out so the room could actually sleep 5 people. Aside from that extra bed and the fact that the main beds 2 queens were elevated off of the floor enough that you could store your luggage underneath there was nothing special about the rooms. The PolThe pool looked pretty great but as it was only in the upper 60s when we visited we did not get to try them out. TransportationUnlike Disney World where there is dedicated transportation to get you anywhere on property you want to go everything at Disneyland is walking distance. As I said before GC has a private entrance to California Adventure Park and to Downtown Disney and the walk from GC to the Disneyland Park is no more than 300 yards. Also unlike Disney World there is no transportation from the airport to the hotel. You have to get there on your own. We had a rental car because Disneyland was only a small part of our trip so if you have a car it makes life easier but they will charge you 20 day for self park and 30 day for valet unles you \u2019re a Disney Vacation Club member staying on points which I was in which case self park is free valet is still 30 day. OveralOveral GC is without question the most beautiful hotel I have ever stayed at. Everything about it was perfect. And with that said I absolutely recommend against staying here. It is not worth the 60night rack rate or an entire years \u2019 worth of your DVC points. There simply is n\u2019t the advantage of staying on site in Anaheim like there is in Orlando. Yes there are \u201c extra magic hours \u201d that let you into 1 of the 2 parks an hour early but absolutely nothing is open during that hour so basically you \u2019re just walking around an empty park staring at closed rides. If you \u2019re going to go to Disneyland there are plenty of chain hotel son Harbor Boulevard that are less than 1 mile from the gates of Disneyland and California Adventure the gates of the 2 parks are separated by what looks like a cobblestone football field for a fraction of the cost.

We live in Los Angeles and we wanted to get away for a couple of nights and have some fun. Not having been to Disneyland in many years my husband and I decide to drive south to visit the park. We did not want to stay ofsite and weekends like this are rare for us so we decided to stay at the Grand Californian and boy are we happy we didi. The hotel is huge but tastefully done. We loved the exterior and interior design as well as the furniture in the lobby and inside our room. This hotel is VERY expensive but well worth it because of service food quality cast member support and ease of getting in and out of the park. We will never stay anywhere else. We arrived very early in the morning wanting to put in a full day at the park. We were greeted by very friendly staff Cast Members and our check in was very quick. The cast member answered all our questions and was happy to help us with everything we needed. As the hotel was almost sold out the night before our room was not ready which we expected. It was 7 am. so they offered to store our luggage and texted us a couple of hours later that our room was ready for us. The room was spacious with a very comfortable bed. A balcony that we had breakfast on great amenities very hot shower with strong water pressure added to our enjoyable stay. The PLUS was that the room was extremely quiet which was a concern with all the children staying at the facility. I highly recommend getting a room that overlooks the inside courtyard. Other rooms face outside onto the street or onto Downtown Disney and the crowd noise can be loud. Like any upscale hotel there was the standard iron ironing board fridge and coffee maker Keurig. There were two very comfortable bathrobes for our use. The floor supported an ice machine and vending machine for water etc. The furniture in the room was beautiful and top notch. The room including the dressing area and bathroom were SPOTLESS. I was so impressed with how well maintained and how clean the room was considering the number of guests they get. We ordered room service for breakfast in the morning and the food was hot and delicious. The portion sizes were huge. My hubby could not finish his Denver omelette which was delicious and I had the standard American Breakfast that included a basted of pastries juice and coffee. The kitchen is very concerned with allergies and was able to make our meal without gluten which was fantastic and necessary. The gluten free breads were delicious. The hotel has their own private entrance into California Adventure which made it very easy and fast to get in and out of the park. We would end our evenings having a glass of wine at the hotel bar. The pricing was fair and not overly expensive. Their wine selection is pretty good as well. The room was refreshed during the day and chocolates were left on our pillows. Hubby used the fitness center at the hotel was huge with plenty weight machines elliptical machines and treadmills. Again it was very clean and well maintained. Our only disappointment which was minor was that the Spa was not able to acomodate massages for us both. They did not have enough staff for mid morning massages on the day we checked out. Lost income for the resort. Check out was quick. Our car was waiting for us when we departed. Being able to call the valet prior to leaving the room was a nice plus. We will definitely return and stay at the Grand Californian. It went above and beyond our expectations.", "offset": [1043, 1149], "date": "2019-05-04", "cpt": "1", "category": "room"}, {"id": 18, "uid": "694552e4-51e7-4632-a5ba-d45ff62fc826", "sentence": "Disneyland Luxury. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at The Grand Californian. It was on my must do list for our family vacation this year. From the moment you drive onto the property you are treated like you are the only guest that matters. The check in process was seamless. I was granted my request for a theme park view room. I love the decor of the resort. true Northern California nature. The location of the resort is fantastic. Guests are able to walk right in to Disneys California Adventures. The early morning magic a perk for hotel guests was incredible. We rode all the popular rides before the park even opened to the public. Another plus was the short walk to Downtown Disney and Disneyland. The convenience allowed for my daughter and her cousintenagers to stay in the park by themselves. But my most favorite part of our stay was the pool area. The lounge chairs were so comfy and inviting. We never had an issue finding four lounge chairs for our family to use. Also we splurged and order drinks from the DCH Craftsman Bar and Grill. So relaxing after a long day in the parks. My only disappointment was that the water slide wasnt working. The kids were very disappointed especially since staff members told them it would be opened shorty. It never opened during our 4 night stay.", "offset": [274, 326], "date": "2019-08-07", "cpt": "1", "category": "room"}, {"id": 19, "uid": "e8c15f99-469e-4c62-8457-57d8add1a308", "sentence": "Great location. Great location. Hotel looks amazing. We have stayed in this the pier and Disneyland hotel. I prefer the Disney hotel. The Californian is such a busy hotel. The bar area is just too small for the size hotel. Disney has lost its Disney. We have been going for over 10 years. It is now a hotel with a theme park. It used to be all Disney. the staff now act like it is a job and a theme park. They used to appreciate it is Disney and magical. The hotel is nice and a perfect location. You can go into California park fromThis hotel. You can walk out to get a coffee and food options. Room service was fast. We had a suite and it was large and had a balcony. The pool area is nice and a great way to relax.", "offset": [596, 618], "date": "2019-10-18", "cpt": "1", "category": "room"}]}
