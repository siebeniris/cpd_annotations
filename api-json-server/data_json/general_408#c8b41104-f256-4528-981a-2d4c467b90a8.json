We have stayed in all levels of the rooms from the cheapest no frills to the deluxe suites. This trip we bounced between three rooms of the premium view level and they all had problems. Peeling wallpaper odors broken plumbing. it is not worth the price to have to deal with wasting a day to find an acceptable room. Once we got a room that was not having uninhabitable issues all of the beds were extremely uncomfortable and smaller than advertised. If you are told you are getting 2 queens you will be getting two double beds. The king bed is a queen that somehow seems scaled down from a true queen. This hotel is showing its age and is not worth the high price or hassle of runaround. The staff gave us two fast pass tickets as consolation. When we tried to use the passes in the parks we were hassled and told the passes were not written correctly and could not be used as they were offered and written.", "offset": [825, 988], "date": "2015-08-16", "cpt": "0", "category": "general"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "f86e5f82-e74e-4e13-8670-b1b243cb5767", "sentence": "Grand. Maybe a little but not too grand. we have stayed at both the other Disneyland Resort hotels in the past but this was our first trip to Disneys Grand Californian. We stayed 5916 5116 in a woods view room on the 5th floor room 501. It was right around the corner from the elevator but we did not hear any elevator noise. That particular room had 2 queen beds but the room we could see around the corner from our balcony had bunkbeds. it is not the best view but you can watch the Disneyland fireworks from your balcony which is nice if you are tired and want to get to bed 100 after the fireworks conclude. It was nice to have a small refrigerator in the room. The decor was nice and tasteful but there was no Mickey features to be found only a picture of Snow White. Although the shower curtain had Bambi and Thumper on it. There we no wrapped cups in the room only small glasses and coffee mugs that you are never really sure get washed. One thing about the room is that is had an odor we noticed as soon as we opened the door. It was not overwhelming and you got used to it after awhile. It smelled like someone in the room had smoked and aerosols were used to try and cover up the smell. We always left the balcony door open to air it out. Beautiful wooden staircases and wooden beams are found around the lobby. The atmosphere and decor is more formal in comparison to the Disneyland Hotel and Paradise Pier Hotel. Although I found it to be comfortable and relaxing in a less fun stuffy way. If you want a more kid friendly and fun hotel I had suggest the Disneyland Hotel where you get more Disney style magic. Staff were all helpful and friendly. In fact staff sometimes have to go out of the way to make up for some poor Disney choices and policy. When we checked in we were advised that we could view the World of Color show from a private viewing deck on the 6th floor which is specifically reserved for hotel guests and require a room key for admittance. We were in the park during the first night of our stay and could have joined the masses in the park viewing area but we were tired and wanted to enjoy a less crowded show from the hotel. However after walking all the way back we discovered that our private viewing deck was no longer available due to a last minute reservation of a private party renting it. I found it very rude and not so nice to paying hotel customers for Disney to promise a private viewing deck and then not deliver the promise. We were not the only hotel guests who showed up to watch the show from the private deck that was supposed to be reserved for hotel guests there were about 20 others that we saw. While Lamar Front Desk Manager appeared to genuinely feel bad and really tried to make it right for hotel guests her supervisors were less than accommodating which is sad because this hotel is very expensive. Another issue we discovered is that Disney advertises there is a private entrance into Disneys California Adventure Park for resort hotel guests only. True there is a private entrance and it is available to all guests staying at any of the 3 Disneyland Resort Hotel properties but they do not check for room keys to verify you are a guest at one of the resort hotels. We had used this entrance years ago when staying at one of the other 2 resort hotels and they actually asked for valid hotel room keys for verification. Not anymore anyone and everyone uses the entrance that Disney falsely advertises as a perk of being a resort hotel guest. While I love Disney it upsets me when Disney devalues guests by failing to deliver advertised promises especially when we pay o much to be a guest. I would not claim that the Grand Californian Hotel is an actual resort style hotel. We stayed at Disneys Aulani Resort Hotel and Spa in Hawaii last year which is a real resort hotel and spa and nothing comparable to Disneys Grand Californian Hotel. Aulani was much nicer had a lot more to offer and was less expensive than the Grand Californian Hotel. About the only real thing the Grand Californian Hotel can actually claim is having a good proximity to the Disneyland theme parks. We enjoyed our stay. Disney can and should make some positive changes to value hotel guests more by correcting some falsely advertised perks. I would consider staying at the Grand Californian again.", "offset": [1249, 1321], "date": "2016-05-12", "cpt": "0", "category": "general"}, {"id": 2, "uid": "0de4f2b0-0191-4eac-ad41-22691f7f9a69", "sentence": "Disappointing for the top Disney owned property.

Our family stayed in mid January for 6 days around the Star Wars Half Marathon Weekend. We are a couple in our 30s and have a 9year old daughter. We are frequent Disney resort visitors and runDisney athletes. We have stayed in almost all of the Disney properties in Orlando and have stayed at both the Grand Californian and off site Disney resorts in Anaheim. Also I travel quite a bit for work and stay in every type of hotel around the US and UK. I was disappointed in the room here. it was comfortable clean and an adequate size but it did not feel anywhere near luxury. I had just stayed in a Holiday Inn in Kentucky a few weeks ago and this did not feel much nicer. In fact the Holiday Inn was actually more updated in terms of room amenities. The rooms need some serious upgrades here to feel like they are worth the price. The rooms are not as nice as the deluxe resorts at a similar price in Disney World. However this hotel has a lot going for it outside the rooms. The lobby is grand and lovely. The piano player is such a nice touch for the ambiance. The staff was the friendliest we have seen anywhere we have stayed. We had great experiences with the character breakfast and eating in the bar lounge. The quick service place was fine for breakfast but I would not plan to eat there. The best aspect of the hotel is the location.

My daughter ended sleeping in the lobby because she was so exhausted. When we got into our rooms we saw so many mosquitoes and gnats flying around. It was SO gross. They were all flying around the kitchen area the living room area and they were all hovering around the drapes. I even saw some that were dead like someone had killed them prior and left it there did not even bother cleaning it up afterwards on the bathroom ceiling I tried to switch rooms but according to the staff they can not guarantee that other rooms are going to be bugs free. The only thing the staff did was gave us vouchers for free dinner mealbut guess what my sister immediately got bitten that night when we slept over. And our family knows how allergic she gets. it was horrible. i wish they would have close off those rooms and not let guests stay because you do not want little kids to get bitten.

I was told all new rooms have shower only so this is an f up that can not be undone. Also the pool was closed and nobody said a word. Stay in one of the many hotels around Disney with water parks. A friend said but it is so convent to stay there for park access. Well not if you rent a stroller from Disney. You can not bring it in the hotel or rent it overnight. So you are basically a schmuck every day at the entrances and exits solely to return the damn stroller on a daily basis. How the heck could Disney overlook this huge inconvenience. Also the walls are paper thin. I can literally hear every word of conversations in the next room and people are talking at a normal level. You hear every door shut and suitcase rolling above you too.

The new rooms have a retro California look to them I do not know if they are trying to get away from the cabin look but we prefer the dark woodsy furniture and carpet.

On our first trip to Disneyland to celebrate our daughter \u2019s birthday we splurged on 3 nights at Disney \u2019s Grand Californian GC. We chose Club Level accommodations and were NOT disappointed. Because it was our first trip we also ended up spending 2 additional nights at a Good Neighbor hotel across the street and while that hotel was nice the Grand Californian offers that extra Disney magic touch which we missed when we left. At 70night during the off season Club Level at GC is expensive. Rooms are not guaranteed to be available until 4 pm. The trim itself was a nice size 2 queen beds a sofa \u201c daybed \u201d which when opened had an enchanting Bambi fresco painted on the wood. Our family of 3 fit easily comfortably in the space. The room had thoughtfully arranged storage spaces shelving in the bathrooms above below the sink beds high enough to slide suitcases under them. The shower had both a rain shower style head a wall mounted hand held wand making it easy to shower thoroughly rinse our little one. Club Level includes special concierge service access to the Veranda where food is served continuously all day starting at 6 or 630 depending on when the parks open. We ate breakfast lunch dinner there every day with the only exceptions being dining package reservations for Fantasmic Frozen World of Color Disney Princess Breakfast which were all worth it. These meals alone easily saved us 200 day in food expenses for a family of 3. The Veranda includes complimentary beer wine sparkling wine mimosas which we enjoyed saving us 9 13 per drink. You can take drinks back to your room sit on your balcony a small 2 seat space and enjoy an evening cocktail while you watch the sun set. As guests at GC we also enjoyed Extra Magic Hour at Disney \u2019s California Adventure DCA Disneyland a perk where guests of Disneyland Resort hotels get to enter the parks a full hour early. Using this perk Maxpas we were easily able to ride every single ride at the two parks multiple times a day yes including Radiator Springs Racers Space Mountain without EVER waiting in a standby line. Since there is direct access from GC to DCA Downtown Disney we were easily able to take midday breaks returning to the hotel for lunch. a nap so our little one never had a meltdown at the park. We had impeccable service from the valet bellhop services concierge services room service at every meal.
