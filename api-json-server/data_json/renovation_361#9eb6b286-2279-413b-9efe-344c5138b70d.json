I booked a room here for a week long conference and all I can say is that this is a hotel that is designed for business travelers that can expense their stay as I find it hard to imagine that this is a place individuals would pay the rack rate to stay at. Pulling in you are informed that there is a 32 day parking charge followed by sticker shock when you get to your room and see the prices for the snacks they offer. A short walk to Trader Joes picked up a bag for the week costing all of 10 where as a vending machine bag of cookies in the room would set you back 7The room was comfortable but small especially when comparing it to what you get at Embassy Suites just down the street. There were issues such as the toilet running all night which required two visits from Maintenance to correct and the TV not working the first night. Meals are equally as exorbitantly priced if you want breakfast there is a spot next door that is reasonable and of high quality Highland Bakery and Caribou Coffee is a bock or two further down Peachtre.

Just stayed at the W Buckhead over the weekend. The hotels redeeming qualities are its staff pool and rooftop club. The rooms are average and need some maintenance. By way of example the rooms are equipped with blackout shades. When I tried to pull the shade down the entire thing collapsed on me. Next I noticed paint peeling off throughout the room. Finally there was a large dead cockroach on my floor. This really makes you want to dive into bed insert sarcasm. When I brought it to the hotels attention they offered to compensate me with additional starwod points but that never happened.

Overall the hotel itself is just ok. The lobby is in good shape and as cool as you would expect a W to be. The rooms are pretty old on the smaller side and dated and could use to be spruced up. The reason for the 1star rating is two fold. First and foremost they try and trick you into paying more either points or dollars for the exact same room. They have three room types Spectacular Wonderful and Fabulous. that by their own admission I had a few fruitless emails back and forth with them are exactly the same no size difference no decor difference. They try to trick you on the website by using a slightly wider picture angle for each step up you go in the upgrade chain to make each room look bigger than the last but again it is the exact same room from another angle. According to the W the only difference is you get a higher floor as you upgrade the room. I was dumb enough to go for the highest level Fabulous room and was on floor 5 so it did not even seem like I even got my floor upgraded all that much. The second issue was the parking. There is a 35 valet parking fee and that is the only option. I understand the hotel is in the city and sometimes there are fees for parking even high fees. My issue is that they did not tell you about this fee anywhere in the reservation but rather sprung it on you once you are there. There is even a section on the reservation on the spgcom site that calls out additional fees and it is not even listed there I went in and made another reservation to be sure. They conceded this point but their defense was that the fee is listed on their website on a page that is inaccessible from the spg site by the way. Please just tell me the total cost ahead of time so I can make make an informed decision as a consumer. If it is an honest and fair charge then why hide it. Overall for a hotel that is not that great to begin with I would encourage you to skip this one based on how they seem to want to make up for lost revenue by tricking their customers into paying undisclosed fees and for upgrades that really are not upgrades.", "offset": [163, 249], "date": "2016-04-25", "cpt": "0", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 4, "uid": "c57aaa3f-d1c6-40fa-8d16-482a761eb791", "sentence": "A huge disapoinment for the money hotel has really gone down hill could use a refit.

Starwod member. Chose W Hotel Atlanta to celebrate spouses birthday. Purchased the Extreme Wow Room. Staff was great with placing balloons and wine in room however room itself was not up to par for the money paid. Blackout blinds were not operational. When tech came to repair it was obvious he was not sure how to operate or repair. Bose stereo system was inop. When brought to attention of front desk they informed me they were aware of the problem and it was like that in quite a few rooms they just had not removed them. This obvious error should have been brought to my attention prior to purchasing the room and would have given me the option of choosing another. False advertising. Cleaning attendant did not clean room during the time we were there. Left used glasses in room and did not replace with new ones. Did not sweep floor only remade beds. Bathroom shower remote control was inop. no batteries. Should have been checked prior to my check in. Overall these below standard items again this is based upon purchasing one of their elite rooms the Extreme Wow Room which by its type should have warranted more attention. put a dark cloud on the celebration. In the front desks defense after I brought the initial concern the Bose speakers not working they did credit me with 10 Starwod points HOWEVER all of the other items were noticed after that and nothing was doing to acomodate me. I felt at least a night should have been compd or etc. Maybe I am asking too much however again I did not get the standard room I purchased one of their elite rooms. that alone warrants more consideration.

I have stayed at this W several times before. The renovations are great and the staff is very friendly and accommodating and the room was clean and comfortable. That has not changed. However I AM seriously concerned about the level of training for the staff. As a petite female traveling alone this was all the more concerning. As I was completing the check in process AND after the clerk handed me my keycard with room number I asked when the bellman would be bringing my bags up. The clerk replied that it would be soon and added the question. Room 425 rightI know this is a HUGE no no regardless of who the guest is but it is especially concerning for a female traveling alone. Now granted there were only 3 4 people in the lobby within earshot but that should not matter. Staff should NEVER say the room number aloud out of concern for their guests safety. While I believe this to be an honest mistake it is a reflection of a lack of adequate training on the part of a high end hotel. This major concern is the basis for my lower rating.
