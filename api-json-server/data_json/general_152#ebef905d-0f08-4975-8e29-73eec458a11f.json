I enjoyed my previous stay in the hotel and so booked for another visit. It was a mistake. The location is very convenient and the hotel has a great gym and great pool area. The hotel itself looks like something out of the golden age of Hollywood. There were two issues that mean that I will not be back. Firstly I was looking forward to using the great swimming pool area but it was closed as they were filming a movie. No compensation offered just sorry you can not use it. Given that it was a key reason why I chose the hotel in the first place it is not good enough. Mechanical failure of the pool would be one thing but shutting the whole area and sacrificing the guest experience to allow some company to do their thing is completely unacceptable. They offered a shuttle to take guests to another hotel to use another pool but that was an unattractive alternative. The second problem was the shuttle which does not run frequently. I waited for nearly half an hour at LAX and another 15 mins on the return. Each time I passed there was a line of people at the front of the hotel waiting to leave I counted 18 people at one stage. I noted that the other hotels in the area seem to have many more shuttles going around eg I lost count of the Sheratons and Hiltons going past. It actually takes about 20 minutes to walk from the hotel to LAX Terminal 1 I tried it one evening. so that is an option. There is no free wifi in the rooms only the lobby. so it was 13 per day. I am a Mariot card holder but you only get free wifi if you are a card holder and you book direct with Mariot and as my company uses another booking provider I was out of luck. Having said all that the staff were nice the rooms are of a high standard and the gym is still excellent.

We booked a room package with 14day parking which was less than simply parking at LAX or any of the lots while we went on vacation. The airport shuttle was prompt both ways and the drivers were helpful with our luggage. So for the reasons we booked it it fulfilled our expectations. The check in process was quick and JP was very helpful suggesting local dining options. It was Thanksgiving so not many places were open and we decided to go to the hotel sports bar Champions. Everyone was so nice and we all joked about not having to do dishes after the big holiday meal. The prices are a bit high for food and astronomical for drinks but for the area it us to be expected. The food was good. We had the nachos a buffalo chicken sandwich and chesesteak. We also had 22 oz. Sculpin brews 11 each. but after a long day of international travel we were suckers for a tall frosty good beer. Our room was a bit dated with a abnormally narrow doorway a slightly musty smell a tiny bathroom and super soft squishy pillows that my neck was not fond of and I had requested extra foam pillows but did not receive any. The room was clean had a fridge to put our left overs in was quiet had a coffee tea maker with complimentary bits of both and had nice dark curtains. I would have given the place 4 stars but when my husband went down to the front desk to validate our parking ticket for the room package deal the woman working the desk repeatedly told him to give the ticket to the valet even after he had repeatedly told her that we did not valet park. She finally validated the ticket and then as my husband turned to leave he heard the woman and a co worker talking trash and remarking that he did not know what he was talking about.

Average Hotel Average Rating. Reading the reviews of the LAX Mariot I came across a lot of comments referring to the property as a typical Mariot or safe. I would say the decor and rooms are a bit lower quality than your typical Mariot but overall those are fair assessments. Being close to the airport is nice but by LAX there are so many other choices that it needs a bit more to be competitive. Average hotel average rating. For a little more detail I had a short stay in LA and it made sense to stay by the airport. I was excited about the complimentary hotel shuttle but I waited nearly 25 minutes for it to arrive frustratingly watching other hotels shuttles come by time and time again. If I had known how long it would take and the low price of Uber in the area I would have just taken a cab even though the ride is only a few minutes. Check In was pretty smooth although the elite desk was not manned. My room was pretty small small desk TV bed and little other room and in need of a renovation. The carpeting was drab and there were some obvious signs of wear and tear. The shower pressure very important to me was great but I can not understand why the shower heads are so low. I am 6 ft and I still had to bend my head crouch in order to get under the shower head. The lounge is under renovation so breakfast was served in one of the lobby restaurants. Due to my jetlag I was there early so the crowd was sparse. I thought they did a nice job explained it clearly executed it well. I did not eat at any of the restaurants but did enjoy the Starbucks in the lobby. Free coffee is better but good to have a quality option. I also did not rent a car thanks Uber but the fee was a little bit higher than some of the other hotels in the area.
