Our two most abiding memories of this hotel are of a fantastic meal in Nobu one of the best I have had in years and of the various lovely pooches we met during our stay. We were in Budapest to celebrate a significant birthday and had meticulously advised the hotel in advance. Unfortunately it seemed not to have registered with them at all either that or else they make a point of studiously ignoring their guests life events. My wife found corresponding with the hotel in advance a little difficult made no easier by the fact we speak no Hungarian whatsoever. I would recommend to avoid the Breakfast life Tiffanys experience on a Sunday morning. For us this was a choice between that breakfast and a family show at the Opera we are still kicking ourselves that we missed the Opera. With all the negatives out of the way this was really a very slick and efficient hotel and a most pleasant experience. The location is excellent walking distance to shops and with easy access to all of the sights. Our room was comfortable and impeccably clean with nespreso machine hairdryer and in room ironing board we are fastidious about creased clothes of an evening and it is nice to be able to run an iron over a shirt quickly without having to plan ahead or involve housekeeping. We slept well and the bathroom was lovely with high quality toiletries and plenty of them. We upgraded to a suite because we tend to spend quite a bit of time in the room when we are staying abroad. The cost was not insignificant but worth it in our view. Breakfast was ample with plenty of choice and lots of nice touches the honey on the comb was a particular favourite. My daughter and I enjoyed a nice dip in the admittedly small spa pool and I enjoyed a really good massage organised late in the evening and at short notice by the hotel. After I left a bag behind in a taxi who had tried to overcharge me. I thought there was no way I would see it again as I could not remember the name of the taxi company involved. Some quick thinking and a scan of the hotels security video organised by the concierge and I was reunited with my bag less than an hour later. My only disappointment was that I had to suggest to the concierge that they check their security footage. Last but definitely not least Nobu. This was a big factor in our deciding to stay at the Kempinski Budapest. We pushed the boat out and had a really special meal there the night after our arrival. We were not disappointed and the chefs tasting menu was everything we could have asked for. Of particular note was the fact that my wife a vegetarian was just as happy with her meal as I was with mine. The acid test if we were coming back to Budapest would we stay at the Kempinski or try another hotel in the hope of getting better. I think we would most likely be back.", "offset": [816, 934], "date": "2015-02-15", "cpt": "0", "category": "atmosphere"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "0dcef2c9-e9b0-498a-a6a4-9c7d6e66ace8", "sentence": "Superior Customer experience from front of house reception room comfort including a lovely bathroom with bath and separate shower. fabulous breakfast high quality in room dining.

The hotel itself is maintained to a high standard and the staff really do genuinely take pride in the hotel and their work. We stayed in room 701 a junior suite which has a corner aspect and it was stunning. The breakfast is expensive however when you see the choices and the chefs preparing food and cooking to order etc it is well worth it. Alternatively you can have breakfast in The Living Room and their in house Deli. The food is also wonderful. We love the homemade bread served in little tericoter plant pots. The spa is a must. We had massages and treatments every day we were there and the girls are amazing and well trained. The pool and saunas etc are never crowded. We had it to ourselves most days apart from one or two other people. I must give a shout out to these members of staff that make our stay special. it is impossible to name them all.

We are truly disappointed. This is not what I expected from a Kempinski Hotel. We made a reservation for 5 rooms about 4 months prior arrival and e mailed all the information very detailed and accurate in order to make sure everything is fully organized. Everything was confirmed by the hotel. Upon arrival we received five rooms on three different floors. We were very surprised. When we arrived before the entire family we spoke to the receptionist regarding this matter and she said they can put four rooms on the same floor and one room only on a different one. I confirmed happily. She said she would take care of it. The family came later on and nothing has changed. They received rooms on three different floors. This is not ok. Furthermore they received two rooms at 150 upon arrival and the other two rooms were not ready. Only at 1630 they received the other rooms keys. Four out five rooms should have had extra bed for child \u2013 pre booked. None of the rooms had extra bed. It took about extra 1 hour to provide it to all the rooms.

It is differentiated from the 19th century buildings around it as the Corvinus is a modern twist on the neighbourhood. It is front and centre to Erzebit Park and the Budapest Eye a giant Feris wheel so I can go around in circles. The terrace side of the Corvinus backs on to Fashion Street with designer stores like Tomy Hilfiger Perry Ellis and the like as well as quaint cafes. The envious location of the hotel makes it a great kick off point for exploring top attractions like the Parliament buildings the Chain Bridge and the Danube. The architecture of the glass clad Corvinus is structured to assume the shape of the letter C. the Big CThe hotel entrance is slightly hidden but once you are in the lobby deserves an impressive. wow. It is refreshing open with high ceilings and circular space. Two large wall panels shoot up to the ceiling projecting outward to form an elaborate and eye popping canopy. The dark marble floor and deep earthy tones inspire a cool and calm attitude. A beautiful piano key looking multi coloured inlaid tile walk way snakes around the floor leading to a modern staircase. The ground floor has been designed as a mini promenade with retailers such as delis cafes a gift shop and a gallery. Rooms are sizeable and decorated with classic creams and gold trim. Art Deco design predominates as with the headboard and the radius engineered furniture. The beds are Uber comfortable and with pillow menus this makes for a delightful sleep. A high tech infotainment system and a smart LED TV top off the rooms electronic appliances. Baths are decked in shiny marble adding a dab of pop to the walls and floors and are further embellished by steel fittings. The Corvinus has a fine repertoire of rooms with additional upscale amenities as the category rises. The Corvinus comes with a chest of choices to enjoy culinary pleasures and liquid bread. The Es Bistro is a great eatery with a brasserie ambience and open for all meal day parts. This buzy restaurant serves up a fantastic breakfast and is also a relaxed place for dinner with good regional food. There are lots of chalk boards with quips and menu specials. When the weather cooperates the street side terrace on Fashion Street is popular. Nobu is the new kid on the block as far as Budapest restaurants go but enjoys critical worldly acclaim for its culinary delicacies. The menu is a melange of Japanese Peruvian with Hungarian ingredients. I tried the Black Cod in Misco. super duper. The Blue Fox is the place for your custom crafted cocktails and in addition on the weekend this place rocks to the sound of a DJs curated playlists or live performances. The Living Room is a Hungarian Coffee House puts Starbucks to shame offering teas coffee strudel and other sweet niceties. The Spa an opulent Asian oriented facility designed to rebalance and rejuvenate the muscles after a hectic day of sightseeing. There is a fine array of therapeutic treatments at the Spa as well as a modern gym and pool with whirlpool tub functionality. The hotel is home to the Unique Corvinus Gallery which specializes in Modern Hungarian Art. As well rooms and public spaces are dedicated to the Kempinskis wide range of curated art. Service was top notch and the moxi of the staff proved instrumental in the exceptional execution of their chores. The concierge team was amped up to provide attraction guidance to help guests resolve their sightseeing issues.
