While I stayed at the Clinton in 2013 I vividly remember everything about the hotel. Everything about it was perfect. I traveled with two friends and our room was absolutely HUGE. I had have to say Hotel Clinton definitely set the standard in hotels of which my friends and I are accustomed to when we travel to South Beach Miami. We were greeted from a friendly staff and were placed on the 2nd floor which is perfect for us since we do not really sleep when we go to Miami. We LOVED the pool while small it was still perfect. They had hookahs and an Open Bar between 7PM and 8PM which was perfect and we took advantage of as I would tell everyone who stays here to do so. The food at the restaurant was great and we loved every second spent there. As we left we were given a business card that granted us a discount for the next time we stayed at Clinton. we have tried to book the hotel again however the price of the hotel has gone up since 2013 and I do not blame them.
