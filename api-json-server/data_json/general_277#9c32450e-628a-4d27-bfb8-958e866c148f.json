A Mariot loyalist but tried this Hilton for convenience to our downtown activities. Have stayed at countless hotels over the past 15 years and this is the first time a Hilton or Mariot has not had an in room refrigerator. I was shocked we had to keep our water and snacks on ice. If you can live without a refrigerator take comfort in knowing that with the exception of our waiter for late night drinks who was incredibly slow the staff was amazing. I was greeted with a live enthusiastic and helpful voice overtime I made a phone call before during and after our stay. It was very congested getting into the hotel at rush hour it is on a busy downtown corner. Either the valets were understaffed or a few failed to show up for work but it would make a stay ever so much nice less stressful if the hotel could alleviate the occasional mad rushes at the front door valet registration area.

We stayed at the DoubleTree for Fathers Day weekend. Upon check in around 10 pm we went to our room and someone was already in it. I chalked it up to an honest mistake and they gave us another room. Everything seemed ok other than the air conditioning seems to barely work. So when we go to bed after being exhausted we turn out all of the lights and it looks like it is still daylight in our room. Turns out our room was on the second floor and our windows were to the indoor pool that stays lit the entire night. I would wake up around 1 am and think it was the morning. We were too tired to go down and complain the first night. The next morning I go talk to a manager and he just says yeah those rooms can be bright. He agreed to move us but no other concessions. I was expecting at minimum breakfast. Our new room had the exact same issue with air conditioning that barely worked. Our room was never cooler than 75.
