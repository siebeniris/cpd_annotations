Check in was easy and as I would leave before breakfast the guy swapped my breakfast vouchers for a snack at the cafe which was good of them. This hotel is old and it is a bit tired which you will notice more once you get up to your rooms. The historic doors on my floor not sure if same on others looked like something out of a prison. They have a little plagues on them indicating they are historic which I thought was amusing probably there due to similar thoughts from others being voiced. The room was big the heater loud and controlling the shower temparature almost impossible. So if you are little mr miss perfect then stay away from here.

My hubby I visited NYC last August 2014 review is a wee bit late but here goes. We were 1st timers to New York as there is so many hotels to choose from we really had not a clue were to book my Mam \u2019s friend stayed here so that \u2019s why we booked it and I am glad we did. I was so nervous about staying after reading some of the reviews but we had a fantastic stay. I even brought my own pillow cases just encase but they were not needed. We arrived waited about 20 mins to check in Marie on reception checked us in. She was extremely helpful offered us a smoking room which I could not believe as I thought it was a non smoking hotel so to say that was a massive bonus is an understatement. When booking I booked an offer of breakfast each morning for 10 per person this was brilliant. We had a lovely continental breakfast each morning. Yes the corridors upstairs look like something out of The Shinning which my hubby I found very funny but the room we booked was a lot bigger than I expected. It was very clean a fridge in the room was a great help and an ice machine on every landing and we had a fantastic view of The Empire State Building. The room was cleaned daily which was great. This hotel is so central to EVERYTHING Madison Square Gardens directly across the road. Times Square 10 min walk down the road Central park is a further 10 mins down the road. We just could not believe how lucky we were to have picked the right hotel. Yes it was expensive but at that time of year most hotels in the heart of Manhattan are expensive we were out of the hotel exploring every day before 9 am not back until late so this hotel was just perfect for us.

One other major advantage to the upgrade to Pen50 rooms is the free continental breakfast coffee tea hot chocolate juice new York bagels cream cheese toast jelly sweet rolls and crosiants. we will worth savings each day to have free bkfst.

We waited in line to check in after a long trip for over 20 mins while we watched several employees on computers not even acknowledging those standing in line and not waiting on anyone. Once we reached the counter we were told our room was in the renovated section. We lugged our luggage up to the 13th floor. yes there is a 13th floor. Our room smelled like smoke the rugs in the hall and room were stained along with the bedspreads. The room had two double beds and the tiniest closet and bathroom I have ever seen. And the closet smelled awful. We returned to the front desk to complain about the accommodations waited in line again only to have an employee explain to people behind us that they could cut the line because they were guests. Um so were we. The front desk employee was extremely rude. he told us there were no renovated sections and that our room was one of the best in the hotel. We still expressed our disappointment in the accommodations and we are told this is a 2 star hotel. The manager Singh however was our bright sopt. he was very polite and tried his best to accommodate us. He changed our room to a suite 2 rooms with the connecting door removed and 4 single beds. The rooms are very very dated and not up kept. bathrooms are disgusting. The continental breakfast included in the price of our room was ok. food was fine however there was very few tables to sit and eat. we ate in the hall near the elevator. The location of the hotel is great but the accommodations are dreadful. Upon checkout we were told they could hold our bags for a charge of 5 bag. We approached the bell captain to give him our bags to hold only to be told we had to wait in the check in line first. the line was 30 people deep and was not moving. We decided to go to our car to store the bags of course it would cost 55 to access the car and unles we wanted to wait 30 min for them to pull the car up we would have to walk to the garage with our luggage.

I spent 3 nights here. I had been reading the reviews and felt that it could not possibly be that bad and I was right. I booked a Penn 500 double room for one person and it cost just over \u00a3 100 per night which I think is excellent value for a central location in New York. The best thing was walking out of Penn Station and seeing the hotel immediately across the street. I arrived at 245pm there was a queue which took about 15mins to get through and book in. Over the 3 days I never saw the queue any bigger than when I arrived. Staff at check in were pleasant I did ask for a refurbished room and got one. Getting up to the room was a breeze. There is a large hall with 6 lifts each side the buttons are in the middle at each side just press the up button at either side and then stand back and see which lift lights ups and opens I never waited more than 1min for a lift either up or down. Walking in the upstairs hallways immediately brings to mind the Shinning however once I got to my room on the 12th floor I was delighted they seem to be making a feature of the original 1919 doors albeit not in there original condition the room was very clean I had a great sleep in a very comfortable bed and housekeeping staff kept it clean everyday. The room had obviously been refurbished although I do not think the bath was bath and shower combination also very clean. Toiletries available it is also the very first time I have seen breath freshener as part of the toiletries. There was also a safe iron and ironing board in the cupboard. at the check in I had been told that there was only a safe storage available as there were no safes in the room. so I think the safe is part of the Penn 500 rooms. Overall there was nothing I could complain about in fact the absolute opposite and I could not ask for more except breakfast and free internet it costs 20 for 24hr Wi Fi for the price location and clean comfortable accommodation it ticked every single box. I was on the 12th floor I could barely hear any noise just background city noise which in no way affected my ability to hear the TV or get a good nights sleep. I did occasionally hear sirens and large truck horns but this is New York City. No view from the window the building is covered in Scaffolding.

The hotel staff were the rudest I have seen in my entire life condescending and far from helpful. it is been a year since we went and I am still in shock at how badly they treated us. We had left one of our bags on the airport transfer vehicle and we immediately asked for help at the front desk in order to call the transport and get it back but the receptionists sneered at us. It was not until we were up in our filthy room that I managed to call the transport service and sort everything out. The room was absolutely appalling. The carpets were so old they were lifting up off the floor. Their color was indistinguishable between blue and brown. The walls were full of scuffs and stains and scrapes. The decades old air conditioning unit had a petrified layer of dust on the filters. I am allergic to dust so that was fun. When my husband ran his finger over the TV armoire a ton of dust bunnies fell to the ground. The bathroom was moldy and just plain disgusting. Breakfast was depressing. buttery rolls that left a layer of grease in your mouth week old boiled eggs we cracked one open and it was green brown bread and some chopped up fruit.

I did not see anything creepy in the room on the halls or lobby. The lines for check in are long indeed and they seem to go all day long. I believe I have been lucky when I checked in I only had one person before me. I found the staff at hotel Penn I had to interact with being very pleasant and helpful.

On the other hand you can never leave the hotel if so you decide. There is a good steak house restaurant on site Statler very busy so make reservations if you need a table a coffee shop a convenience store a tour desk a few electronics shops etc. I would suggest guests who experience issues at this huge hotel touch base with staff and ask what they can do about it.

This was a horrid hotel. I had to upgrade my room on arrival because I was staying for business for 5 days and the room was dark and dingy and the bath cracked. My new room was only a little better a Penn 500 Room classed as their top room. It was cold and so noisy from outside noise. The only good thing was that it was quiet inside. The shower was hot and powerful which was good. As a business traveller I always book free breakfast and Wi fi. A continental breakfast was included which consisted of a small coffee OJ and pastry only. to go. Nowhere does it say this. I have already emailed bokingcom to complain. The only place it is shown is in the small print after you have booked the hotel. This is a con and I have said this. As a business traveller breakfast is important. It means that when I am in meetings all day to maximise my time abroad I do not have to think about food until the end of the day. I am outraged by this con. On leaving I queued for 20 minutes to check out. They do not have enough staff to cater for the numbers of guests both at the desk and through the hotel to keep it clean. If you want to use TapOut bring your own lock and towel where does it say that in the small print. You have to pay to have your luggage stored aswel and Sergei the bell captain just said it is business that \u2019s how it is. No hotel I know of has ever charged for this service. The worst experience of my life. Hotel Penn management you need to sort this out and especially the breakfast and advertise it like it is for business travellers who expect a sit down breakfast. There is one good thing that makes this review not \u2018 0 \u2019. although I do not get the chance to choose \u2018 0 \u2019.

And even though they say kids stay free they do not give you breakfast vouchers for the kids. The shower goes back and forth from warm to scalding hot with no notice. I was afraid to let my kids shower because I did not want them getting burnt but afraid to let them take a bath because the tub is nasty and has peeling up paint.

On checking in having paid our 5 nights in full through Agoda they threw a compulsory 40 daily \u201c facilities fee \u201d at us. This is a daily charge for every room.

We had to have it. That consisted of a voucher which had to be taken to a restaurant in a side street. On surrendering the voucher you got the following a muffin and a cup of coffee or orange juice.
