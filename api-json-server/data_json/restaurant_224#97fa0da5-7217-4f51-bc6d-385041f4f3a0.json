This beautiful very private property is perched almost three levels above street level and as a consequence has a commanding view over the ocean lush frangipani gardens. A recent stay business leisure of one week gave me a chance to try out most of the facilities and get to know by name a number of the great team here. What is clearly noticeable about this property is the courtesy and attention to detail to some very small details and the presence of the management on the floor presiding over all aspects of service. I was greeted on arrival by Mr Bodi excuse spelling. the front office manager who several times organized several requests down to my breakfast for a 5 am departure. The very affable French General Manager Mr Kling quickly made his acquaintance as I sat leisurely in the foyer. He presided daily over the buffet breakfast commendable on the level of choice and quality service every morning and was still to be seen late in the evening hovering around the lobby chatting to guests. The big plusses great service spacious rooms state of the art business center lush tranquil gardens great pool diverse selection of quality in house restaurants big open plan lobby looking out over the ocean. The lagoon rooms on the lower level are great as you can descend down steps from your private patio and swim in the pretty secluded warm lagoon waters. Try out the Japanese restaurant it \u2019s on a level you will find in Tokyo. If you have only one night here or have an ounce of romance in your body. a must is the \u2018 Eight Degrees South \u2019 restaurant practically on the beach.

I would rate the food its presentation and overall service 1010. I ca n\u2019t but help think that the \u2018 ubiquitous Frenchman \u2019s \u2019 style mixed with Balinese hospitality courtesy has trickled down all the through his team as it is very evident that they all plan to make your stay a memorable one.

Wow where to start. My family and I arrived late at night for our seven night stay. We were greeted by Howard who was incredibly polite and welcoming with some refreshing drinks and cool towels for us plus a bag of goodies for our daughter. We had initially booked a garden room view and he informed us that they had up graded us to part ocean pool view. While waiting to be checked in we explored the lobby area and walked out to the balcony overlooking the pool. We were taken back at how beautiful everything looked the architecture the polished limestone tiles the extensive use of dark woods and granite. This place is classy. After a short wait we were taken to our room it was perfectly clean again the use of polished lime stone and granite in the bath room and red wood floor boards in the main room just oozes class. Walking out on to our balcony we were again spell bound by the view. After a few hours sleep I some how woke up and noticed it was dawn I walked out to the balcony. pictures and words just do not do it justice I had to wake up my wife and daughter to see this view. The garden pool and restaurant area looked so clean so well manicured it just did not look real almost like a cartoon or computer generated graphics. I have never seen grassed areas with so many trees and plants kept this perfect. This place has to be the definition of paradise anyone who says different is selling something. Breakfast was excellent with very good coffee huge selection of fresh juices fruits bacon freshly cooked eggs to your liking pastries the list goes on and on. pretty much everything you could wish for all you can eat between 7 am 1am. The humongous swimming pools are truly amazing we spent way too much time here and do not regret one moment. it is nice quiet and very clean and well maintained. We did not experience any loud unruly behaviour from the guests at any time. It was rare not to be able to get a deck chair by the pool if there were none available there was some under some shady trees near by. The two sand beach entrys were really nice my daughter loved building sandcastles for hours. Just wish I remembered to bring my water proof camera. The beach is well maintained. I did see some rubbish had washed up the first morning we were there but staff could be seen cleaning it up and was all done by the time I returned at around 9am. Water sports was great the guys were polite and did not go over board with trying to get you to fork out for something you do not want to buy. Having said that prices seemed reasonable after a little bartering we splashed out for a half hour ride on a jet ski and a paraglide absolutely awesome funWe found the restaurant a little pricey for our budget but this is fine dining. We had dinner there twice beautifully presented food great tasting though not enough but again it is fine dining. We booked for a buffet meal and a dance show which we really enjoyed with lots of different tastes. Our daughter being the inquisitive girl that she is accidentally had a some of our chilly dip needless to say she got a little upset. The restaurant staff was awesome they came running with milk and ice cream calmed her down and was so apologetic even after we explained it was our fault for not paying attention. The restaurant and staff are incredibly good at what they do I hate to criticize do not get me wrong the food is first class but it is a little sad to see such a large restaurant not even half full. I think this is due to the higher prices. This I think is a tactic employed by the hotel to attract a more refined clientele and keep the riff raf away. We did however find some really good restaurants along the main road we were a little taken back by the obvious poverty in the area but soon realized these people are some of the most resilient easy going people you will ever meet. This was our first overseas holiday we had heard all about the awesome hospitality of the Balinese people but experiencing it first hand is something else. The staff are so polite well mannered and helpful it makes Australian hospitality industry look like a disgrace. Most speak English very well I did notice some could speak multiple languages which I thought was quite impressive. However there is one big problem no one mentioned. Oh why did no one not tell us how incredibly hard it is to leave this place this raises the bar too high for other hotels resorts and leaving the resort is really difficult so difficult in fact they should offer some sort of rehabilitation program for guests to deal with the substandard service of other resorts and some counselling when returning to normal life. We were lucky and do recommend other would be guests to check into their favourite hotel in their country of origin. We checked into our favourite family type resort in Perth before heading home. While it is no Conrad it did help bring us back to earth more gently. This place is an absolute credit to Bali and all the staff at the Conrad should be proud of the level of service that they can offer. A big thanks to the Bali Conrad team for making our first big family holiday one to remember. We will definitely be back next year and wish everyone the best.

Booked a suite for 6 nights for my family of three adults and one four year old child. Room was amazing size very plush and in a nice and quiet wing of the building. Only small fault was that the waterfall shower head was clogged which reduced pressure and functionality. Because we were happy enough to use the shower hose instead we did not see need to bring this to staff attention so I am sure they would try and fix it if we asked. so definitely not a complaintAs honors guest in a suite not sure about entitlements of other rooms. we had access to some complimentary features such as breakfast afternoon tea and happy hour. We had breakfast mostly in the main restaurant Suku rather than in the Rin restaurant which is recommended for suite guests. Suku was busier but had better options and was child friendly. Overall breakfast food was okay but not the best I have ever had. Afternoon tea for suite guests was a mix of sandwiches cakes and non alcoholic drinks. Happy hour is great with really good drinks options and more complimentary hot food. Overall food was okay but some more diversity with food mixing the menu up a bit and perhaps some local balinese options. would make it even better. Facilities in hotel were great large grounds with very nice gardens a real highlight. Many pools to choose from. Staying in a suite we had the option of the exclusive pool with polside day bed with bar service. But we also enjoyed the regular lagoon style pool with two sand beaches as entry points. Lots of places to relax lay down in the sun etc. Beach was not as nice as the sand was a bit rough and water not very deep seems no one swims there from what we could see with guests preferring polThis works as a family hotel. Kids club was available though did not seem to be very popular. That said the facilities were there and there is a babysitter service for around USD375 an hour. so this was great. My son enjoyed the pools so we were very happy with it all in all lots of things and places for kids to explore. We had a spa treatment which was much more expensive than what local businesses could offer but we opted for the convenience of doing it in the hotel. Cost around USD10 for a 2 hour treatment this was a couples package on special. They have really good facilities in the spa and is worth the money in my opinion. Staff were very lovely and attentive particularly in the areas serving suite guests. Staff in other areas appear to be much busier and can be hard to get their attention at times.

This was our first trip to Bali and we decided to stay in the Conrad Suites so we would have access to a separate pool for adults. The suites facilities also included afternoon tea and cocktails in the evening. I was very much looking forward to holidaying in Bali and particularly this hotel having splurged on the extra expense with the suites facilities. We did stumble across a few issues though upon arrival which was actually a breakdown in the communication between our travel agent and the hotel. Suffice to say we should have been in a Conrad Pool Suite but ended up in a standard Conrad Suite. The hotel did what they could to rectify this as we had paid for the facilities of the Conrad Pool Suite but the initial drama it caused upon arrival and the significant days after left a bitter tasteHowever the suites were large and in fairly good condition you could tell that the rest of the hotel is slightly dated now and the suites are a little newer. The pool facilities were fantastic and the service at the pool Suites Pool was great we rarely moved from this area during the day although we did venture around the lagoon pool on occasions. The afternoon tea was very pleasant and it is great that they give you the option of having your afternoon tea in different restaurants across the resort as this allows you flexibility throughout your day. In fact often when there were certain items that my husband and I could not eat they quickly made something that we could which was most appreciated. The drinks on offer during the afternoon tea were great as well non alcoholic of course. The evening cocktails were good the timings were from 6 pm 8 pm this was a little early for us so most of the time we would aim to be there just after 7 pm. There is a fantastic restaurant nearby to the entrances of the Conrad Suites called Bumbu Bali we discovered this on our penultimate evening and we wish we had gone there sooner fantastic food and cultural experience. And what s more is that if you reserve a table through the hotel they will come and collect you and drop you back. The restaurants on offer in the hotel area are limited and the food is not great in fact we did not enjoy the food at all so we opted to eat out of the hotel most of the time. We did feed this information back to the managers that they needed to work on improving their restaurants as sometimes people do not wish to explore outside their hotel. Plus it means they are losing revenue by forcing guests to eat out all the time. We ventured out most evenings to experience different restaurants but had there been a good restaurant in the hotel we definitely would have stayed in more. So for a 5 star hotel you expect 5 star quality and this was definitely lacking on the cuisine side of things. I booked in for a Balinese massage the spa and treatment itself was fantastic. There is a separate pool for those who use the spa and the whole area was very tranquil exactly what you expect when indulging in a treatment. I also checked out the gym and other recreational activities the hotel is fully equipped there is a tennis court pool table bikes on offer etc. Certainly something for everyoneWe enjoyed our stay within the Conrad Suites but I think it could do with a bit of a face lift in terms of renovation and restaurant facilities. You can tell that the landscaped gardens are carefully treated I just wish they could do the same for the interiors now. For what we spent on the accommodation I would expect more. I can not fault the staff though they were very friendly and they looked after us very well which was lovely to receive.

I really wish i could give a glowing review for this hotel but they just really let themselves down in silly areas. The size of this hotel is vast for Bali standards. It is a lovely big well maintained resort. There are multiple pools and restaurants. The hotel also has a section of beach which is nice but not private as you will be harassed by local vendors and guys trying to sell you water sports activities. The pools are large and there are lots of sun beds around HOWEVER some of them you have to pay to lay on. I find this bizarre for a 5 star resort. One morning we woke up late and struggled to find a lounger a bit more than other days. When we eventually found 2 empty ones we lay down only for a pool attendant to come over and ask us to sign the bill for the beds. Given they are exactly the same beds as all the others dotted around the grounds why these ones are special and require additional payment is beyond meThe room itself was large and clean with excellent shower pressure. The balcony had an airing rack which i thought was a nice touch for drying off wet clothes. The bed was comfortable and the room also had black out curtains which were great. We did not eat at any of the hotel restaurants as within a 5 10 minute walk you have a good selection of restaurants dotted along the main road where food is of a great standard and 14 of the price. When we checked in we were informed that breakfast was included. Fantastic. So the next morning we say and enjoyed a nice buffet breakfast. Ok coffee and an average selection of pastries cooked breakfast fruit cereals etc. Nothing special though. Then we were presented with a bill to sign. When i asked at reception i was informed the staff member who checked us in the previous night had mis informed us and breakfast was not actually included. They credited us the 60 AUS for the breakfast for which i was grateful as firstly it was their mistake and secondly no way on this planet was the breakfast worth paying 30 AUS a head for. Be sure to clarify whether breakfast is included in your room rate before eating it. Otherwise Starbucks is a 15 minute walk down the road and has much better coffee. The stand out eateries in the local area along the road for us were Ketuts BQ Kitchen tasty Asian food Bobs on the beach gorgeous ribs and Heart of Bali perfect for a quick lunch of spring rolls super tasty Nasi GorengWe were also disappointed to be informed that the steam and sauna facilities are another extra charge on top 1500 per person per day roughly 18 AUS. Again at a 5 star hotel should not the use of these facilities be included as part of the already expensive room rate. The staff at the spa were lovely and informed us if we book a treatment at the spa then we can use those facilities for free. I had a body wrap and it was very relaxing. The spa is gorgeous. The gym is 24 hours and has sufficient equipment. Other than the spa staff the staff members we interacted with were not particularly friendly. We are Hilton Honors members and did not receive any perks or benefits for this other than free wi fi. Would i return. Probably. It is perfect for a nice relaxing break as long as you are prepared to pay extra on top for pretty much everything.", "offset": [1430, 1494], "date": "2017-10-31", "cpt": "0", "category": "restaurant"}, {"id": 10, "uid": "45c5e209-fa30-4aa8-8178-ecf384e58df4", "sentence": "Good hotel but lots of little things could be done better.

Staff were always friendly though I am not sure what the deal was with the water sports staff on the beach they were very pushy trying to get me over there whenever I was outside. which I found unwelcome and a bit tacky. Cleanliness of the room was good room was very quiet and whenever I needed extra water etc it arrived promptly. Housekeeping are amazing in this hotel. I also did yoga with the hotels instructor which was great and I loved that this was something they offered even though it had a fee attached. Gym is decently equipped but as with almost all hotels no squat rack Check in was the poorest part it was 25 minutes from the time I arrived at the front desk until someone gave me my key. I spent over 15 of those sitting on a couch I was directed to for no apparent reason. When the porter rocked up to escort me his first question was what room. I imagined in the 25 minutes it could not have been too hard to get my bag to my room before me let alone work out where I was going. Halfway along the stroll he stopped to ask if the bag he had was actually mine. The hotel appeared very empty during my stay so god knows what took them so long to check me in. When I got to the room the welcome card was for another guest with a very different name to mine. Fruit plate also appeared to have been there a while and there were fruit flies in the room. Minibar was sparse with no food or snacks and amenities in room were otherwise poor no nespreso machine no mouthwash in the bathroom etc. my benchmark for this is other Conrads so to say limited in comparison. Air con was very weak had it set to 10C and high fan the entire time I was there and it was still often quite warm in the room. Mould etc in the grouting in the bathroom which required some attention though room otherwise spotless. Wi fi was fast and strong on the free Honors level. Lunch at Rin Japanese which I had twice was fantastic great service and food. Breakfast at Suku was decent spread was pretty okay but was not much I wanted to eat that is probably on me. The made to order options were great though. I was proactively offered coffee whenever I finished mine and the quality was fantastic. General upkeep of the hotel could be improved as it looked a bit tired but the renovation works underway are presumably addressing this. The renovations did not impact my stay at all there was still plenty of places to eat and swim although there was very rarely a little noise even though I was quite far from the works.

That is only part of its charm you can walk out of the front door of the hotel and be part of the real local Bali. The hotel \u2019s charm is however largely down to its staff. Extremely well trained and natively pleasant. every member of staff. whether cleaning the pools early in the morning or attending to your table at dinner would greet you with a smile and an offer of assistance.

Oh the pools I almost forgot the pools and how could I forget these. Who designed this hotel. How did they manage to integrate about seven pools and make each quite different to the other so that for a whole week you could just go from one to the other as though you were staying at different resorts. And even to get from one to the other they managed to take you through walkways along a succession of ponds water features and waterfalls that all exude subtle serenity of soul and spirit. We got there after a stressful business week in bustly Singapore and left only yesterday after a sunrise swim in balmy waters. much refreshed relaxed and ready for busier times until the next visit.", "offset": [841, 1038], "date": "2018-03-17", "cpt": "1", "category": "restaurant"}, {"id": 16, "uid": "f2ecdc47-f562-4c81-b69b-430403b0e055", "sentence": "Super relaxing location in the Souther Portion of Bali.

It is a bit hard to evaluate the hotel now as major renovations are taking place. Had we not noticed it before arriving we would have been extremely annoyed disappointed. Conrad does not disclose this information openly enough on the hotel website. We had originally booked a standard room but once we learned that there would not be a pool at our disposal for our 3 year old daughter we were forced to upgrade to a suite for 100 USD more per night. Besides from the nicer room this also included a complimentary daily high tea and cocktails and unlimited laundry service. We also got 15 off food and beverages spa. We had an ok stay if one wanted to fix a couple of things we would make the entrance reception space grander for a better first impression and warm up the water in the pools a couple of degrees felt too cold to get into comfortablyIt will not be long when the renovations are completed and the hotel will certainly be a lot nicer then due to access to the big pools and additional restaurants.

We have just completed our seventh stay in six years. After a slightly unfavorable stay in 2017 we returned home to the Conrad Bali where the staff members greeted us with open arms. This property really is home with familiar faces and where the staff knows our likes and dislikes so that they can prepare appropriately for our visit. Although our favorite restaurant Rin was not open for breakfast we did enjoy the expanded breakfast at Suku. The buffet was extensive and there were also some made to order items that one can request from the menu. I jokingly told the new Exec Chef Benoit that I wanted soca and he made it appear one morning. Merci BenoitWe also enjoyed dinners at Suku EDS and Rin good food with excellent service. In the evenings prior to dinner we relaxed in the Exec Lounge or the Lobby Lounge. While the atmosphere is more intimate in the Exec Lounge I had a slight preference for the bartenders in the Lobby Lounge who made better drinks. During our stay we took advantage of the complimentary afternoon yoga meditation and stretching classes. There were enough activities to keep us occupied at the resort so that we rarely left the property during our ten day stay. In addition to our familiar friends Agung Yudi Semawan Agus etc. we made a few new friends this time. Benoit Evelyne and Andi are excellent additions to this hotel.

Not sure if this was a result of the property having different staff over the holiday. In general felt that the property was ill prepared for the holiday and to handle guests during over this period. I felt the staff was uninformed. Staff provided conflicting information as to which restaurants were open or closed conflicting info on the location of activities as well as the price of those activities. Finding out information was a treasure hunt. Also the hallways oddly lacked sufficient lighting for guests requiring us to use our phone lights in the evening even the night prior to Nyepi. Last straw was specifically asking at check in if wellness activities would qualify for a specific resort credit I had applied to my booking and being told all dining spa and wellness would qualify. At check out I was told only dining and spa would qualify. Just a nuisance.
