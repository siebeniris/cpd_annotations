We booked this hotel through a large block of rooms for a nearby sporting event. Two days prior to my arrival I called the hotel and spoke to a female and asked if I could use my Hilton Honors rewards points to reduce the rate of the room and she said yes. She also told me that I could use them when I arrived and to just tell the receptionist I had points and give them the rewards number and they would reduce the rate accordingly. The day of my arrival I informed the male clerk of the points and he told me that it could only be done online and that he could not help me. I told him the female told me differently and he just said she gave you misinformation. At that point we were up for many hours and I needed the room so I asked how I could use my points. He just said you can go online and book the room if there are any available. He refused to help me in any way and I tried to book through the mobile ap but it kept coming up an error. I showed him the error and asked for his help. He said he could not help and moved on to the next guest in line. I had no choice but to accept the room at the higher price. Once in my room I called the customer service number and she re booked my room and allowed me to use my points after sitting on the phone mainly hold for over 20 minutes. She said she had to call the hotel to make sure they were good with that. From start to finish the booking process was HORRIBLE. The clerk did not help me and did not want to provide any assistance on allowing me to use the points or guide me through the process. Then when I checked into the room there was trash between the bed and the wall potato chip bags a baby formula measuring cup and some candy wrappers. The door to the bathroom was a barn style door on rollers and when you shut the door the door would fall off of the roller and would not allow you to open it unles you physically picked up the door and moved it so you could not shut the door while in the bathroom. I was very unsatisfied with the customer service and room and told our team that in future stays I will not be staying at any Hilton. They indicated they would stay elsewhere too so the team could stay together. I was also told by the customer service lady that someone from corporate care would call me on Monday to follow up on my issue and see about comping a room for a night in the future. Guess what. No call on Monday which is not a surprise giving the customer service culture. Definitely not worth the price.", "offset": [108, 283], "date": "2019-06-18", "cpt": "1", "category": "price"}, {"id": 13, "uid": "f46547ee-5cc3-44dd-9525-a293d1c21a2c", "sentence": "Billing Issues. I booked a room for a consultant that I had staying in town for a week so I can not speak to the actual room. My consultant was very unhappy with the attitude of the front desk when she checked in.

My situation was escalated to the operation manger who promised me the three extra charges totaling over 160 that were pending on my account would drop off I check my account today and the charges did officially go through and did not drop off the manager can not seem to answer or figure this billing out.

This stay was one of the worst that I have ever stayed the guy came back and starting pouring in the chemicals while my kids were IN THE POOL.
