Although the beach is not great for swimming it is awesome for snagging one of the many chairs they have and reading a book as the waves crash. The pool is pretty and the hot tub was always the place to hang out day or night. We really enjoyed the entertainment every evening as the sun went down and especially the Tuesday night trivia.

Complimentary beach mats and backpacks which we had been looking for on Oahu prior to our arrival on Kauai. but then weather was rainy when we needed it to do some hiking. Enjoyed live music and dessert one night near the pool. Another night enjoyed the complimentary mai thais we got with our membership. At Mariot Waikiki beach they were just punch so that is what we were expecting when we turned in our drink tix but these were strong. Also on our day leaving we had pina coladas at happy hour. Our room had queen beds which were comfy. Housekeeping did not show up during our 4 days but that was fine since we are not messy guests. Clean bathroom and room overall. Nice view on our second floor balcony over looking the pool and ocean view too. Shuttered hard wood doors to the balcony. would have liked to open the patio door and just let the air circulate through the doors but there was a sign that insects had been more prevalent and to keep the doors not open for long lengths of time.

Great experience overall. Silver elite got us no extra charge for parking which was good because we had to pay to upgrade our rental from the car we booked and found out it was a mystery vehicle of a minivan which then to get a compact or other we had to pay 11 day extra.

First of all I find it interesting that I am unable to leave a review on the Mariot site. Apparently you have to receive a survey in order to do so. So I am leaving the review here. Like many others I booked this stay without being aware of the construction. I was informed of the construction via a email confirmation a week before our trip. There is major construction and the entire pool area is closed. I would not have chosen this hotel had I been aware of the construction. Shame on Mariot for not having it posted clearly on their website for the hotel. Once I knew about the construction I called the hotel and requested a newly renovated room away from the construction noise. I will say that our room was nice with a good view of the ocean. We were on the very south side and never heard construction noise in our room. The hotel is trying to a good job despite the construction. Positives 350 Mai Tais until 6 pm. Chairs Lounges set up along the beach it is a lovely beach to look at but not good for swimming. Pool access at the neighbor hotel we did not use it but it was not crowded and looked nice. The resort fee of 200 a day was a bit of stretch but it included free bikes beach towels chairs etc. In summary if you are able to get a great deal on this hotel and just need a place to sleep I would say to go for it being fully aware of the construction. We enjoyed sitting on the beach in the evenings and were out and about on the island during the days. Plenty of nice restaurants in walking distance and very conveniently located to Kapa town and both sides of the Island. If there is no cost savings pick another property.
