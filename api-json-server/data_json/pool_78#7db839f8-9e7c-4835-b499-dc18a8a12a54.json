My husband and I just returned from six glorious nights at the beautiful Rosewood. As two people who work a lot and travel fairly often to some of the worlds most beautiful places we tend to be a bit particular when it comes to our personal hotel stays. Rosewood Mayakoba exceeded every expectation. And let us be honest there are stunning places all over the world but what separates Rosewood from all the others is the service. The staff is the best in the business. But what was so remarkable is that it was not just the senior staff at the resort but literally every person we crossed paths with during our stay was delightful. They are warm friendly helpful attentive kind and most of all generous. You truly feel like they love what they are doing and it shows. From the incredible amenities at the pool to the additional attention at the spa to the beautiful garden dinner all rank among our favorites from the trip because of the staff. The resort property is stunning. I have read a little about seaweed on the beach but that was not a problem for us. In fact every time we turned around the staff was out ensuring the beach was pristine. The rooms were great. We splurged on the beachside room with the plunge pool and loved the privacy and the space. However I can not imagine you can go wrong with any room. I also highly recommend a personal yoga instructor. This was something I have not done on previous resort visits and I loved it despite the fact the Sonja kicked my tail. My husband describes the golf as phenomenal. He said not only is it the best of the best in terms of the quality but it is also a steal of a deal when compared to other top resort courses. We also really enjoyed the ecotour seeing the pride the team takes in the animals and protecting the habitat was inspiring. We would rate the food as outstanding. The sushi and tequila experience should not be missed ask for Santos. and the beach for lunch hit the spot every time. Please order a michelada in my honor on your next visit. They are a personal favorite. I know this review sounds like I am a pushover but I can assure you I do not hesistate to give one or two star ratings when the experience warrants it. This just so happens to be our favorite vacation yet and we can not wait to return. Huge thanks to the countless people at Rosewood who made our trip so special but especially the INCREDIBLE Monica Ortiz our kind butler Frank and you Daniel for running such a stellar operation.

In a Class of its Own I have been to quite a few high end properties and love writing reviews on them. Some of my favorites over the years includes Le Meridien Koh Samui Thailand Peninsula Bangkok The Four Seasons Maui Montage Laguna Beach and The Grand Del Mar. This one has taken the cake thus far. I was privileged enough to be invited as part of a dental companys presidential club to experience this wonderful resort. Location Ambience. Located about a 30 min drive from the airport this made it a tad further away from my previous Cancun experience Live Aqua. It was also located quite a ways from the action area where the restaurants and club scenes are. However if you want peace and quiet this is it. It is located a ways from the street. Nestled among the natural brush and lagoon. In a very unique setting that I have never quite experience. You will see this lagoon water way every where and can not help but be in awe. The resort is fairly large and spread out. But that enhances the peace and quietness. IT is very private and romantic and serene. You do not feel as though you are in mexico. but a far a way tropical area. It reminded me more of tropical Thailand then mexico. Check in Room. We arrived with a group of about 15 people. We were greeted warmly and given the green welcome drink pretty good. The first thing I noticed was that everyone spoke perfect english. Everyone was very courteous and polite. Check in took just a tad longer even though they had everyone working. I believe that in any normal situation checkin would have taken 5 mins if that. We were given a short orientation and then whisk away on the boat tour. One of the misnomers is that you can call for the boat taxi to get back and forth from room to lobby. This is not true. the boat is only for the welcome tour and drop off. IT was still a wonderful experience. Once we arrived at our room our butler was waiting. She took over from there very very impressive. Our luggage was already in our closet. Our room was amazing. Apparently my friend did well in the company so we got booked in the Mayakoba Suite right below the presidential suite. The only room that rivaled this was the suite we had at Le Meridian in Koh Samui Thailand. It was a 2 story suite with 2 beds. The bathroom is huge with a gigantic shower that connected to the out door deck. All of the amenities in the bathroom was amazing loofah sponge slippers robes toiletry. The beds were really comfy with not too many pillows. Good lighting in the room as well as adequate amount of plugs for charging. Upstairs was a big living room area with dining table another full bath and wetbar kitchenette. There was an espresso maker. The butler had already brought ice and extra water free of charge for us. The view of the lagoon on one side and the ocean on another were both amazing. Now you walk outside on the upper deck and there is a plunge pool with 2 lounge chairs. From there you can take a spiral staircase up to the upper deck where another amazing view awaits you. Plenty of towels every where. Now I do not know what the room cost so I can not tell you if it was a good deal or not. If I had to pay I would prob never get the opportunity to stay in something like this. This room connected with another Suite that mirrored it. So we did open it up and had a wonderful party with our neighbor. What also made this suite perfect was its location to the pool beach and restaurant literally across the walkway. My only wish was that I could have jumped and swam in the lagoon. Service. This is where I usually spend the most time scrutinizing the high end resorts. And this one takes top honors. Many other people have raved about it but I will add to it. Service is amazing here. You will not find anything like it in America I guarantee you. Maybe in Asia but not America. Everyone had one mission and that was to please you and do what you need. Here are some things that stood out. Every room came with a butler. There is a phone ap that you can use to text your butler and they would respond within seconds ie ask for a golf cart request dinner reservations request more water bottles etc. Our luggage has never beaten me to my room except for here. Some crazy level of service that stood out. our plunge pool was on the warmer side and we asked if they could do anything about it. within 15 mins 3 guys with garbage bags of ice came and chilled the pool down for us. CRAZY. My friend dropped her iphone in between the slate of the plunge pool. IT was buried about 3 feet down. We asked if it could be retrieved within 15 mins a crew came with tools and pried open the slates and retrieved her phone. CRAZY. There room service came and set up dinner for us as if we were in a restaurant. These are just a few of the stories that I have. Everyone at the spa was amazing as well. Restaurant Spa Pool I ate at 2 different restaurants. The polside one was very good see my review. Service was excellent and the seafood tacos were all amazing. The breakfast restaurant was also really good. It is a buffet style but you order your entrees fresh. I only wished they had a swim up bar. The pool that we used was their activity pool down by the beach. Water was a nice temperature. The jacuzi was hot so I did nt spend much time there. There were cabanas that you can use free of charge amazing. The lounge chairs were very comfy and there were plenty of seats. Service there was fast and efficient. The spa facility was amazing. Althought I did not get a treatment I utilized the weight room and facility. The fitness room was well stocked. New equipment. Treadmills galore with big screens. Small amount of free weights no bench press setup. Lots of towels and bottle water for complementary use. My friends went to one of their TRX classes and said it was good. The spa facility was awesome. They give you a grand tour and then a locker. The facility was clean. I liked how the dry sauna had towels set up for you to sit and lay on. Lots of fresh juices for you to drink. A great place to spend a few hours. Misc. One thing I really appreciate was the wifi. IT was free no password and pretty fast considering. Great in the room by the pool and so forth. Sketchy in between buildings. Beach. I am not really a beach person. Plus we were only there for a couple of nights. I was totally content hanging in the pool and lounging. So i never made it out to the beach. I do agree with a prev reviewer regarding the weird bushes in front of the infinity pool that blocks the view. I do not get it. Value. This is truly a high end property and it does not come without a cost. If you are concern about money do not come here. Expect to pay 28 for 3 seafood tacos lobster tacos are amazing. Steaks were about 50. Drinks were about 15 but really strong. I thought the spa treatments were actually priced fairly well. I could go on and on on the service food and beauty that is the Rosewood Mayakoba. Unfortunately it is a very high priced resort so I will probably never get a chance to revisit it. I was grateful for the opportunity and would highly recommend it to anyone.", "offset": [2864, 2951], "date": "2015-06-03", "cpt": "0", "category": "pool"}, {"id": 3, "uid": "9e955ccb-31dc-4620-b692-6a580738a770", "sentence": "Spring Break 2015. Excellent location beautiful beaches. Very short ride from the Airport about 30 minutes. Some travel sites indicate over an hour but this was not our experience. Here is a great story. I usually book travel through AMEX Platinum travel. In this booking I called both AMEX and the Rosewood to determine the best accommodations for the 4 of us My wife myself and my two teenage kids Girl and boy. I ended up reserving an Oceanview two double bed suite with plunge pool and rooftop patio. What I thought I was reserving was a suite with a King Bed in one room and a room with two double beds for the kids. When we checked in and arrived at our suite there were two double beds on the ground floor which was clearly the master room. The bathroom for this room was very large included an outdoor and indoor shower large soaking tub and was beautiful. The next level up had a living area that had a pull out queen bed large breakfast area including a generous kitchenette and a separate full bathroom with shower. The patio off this area had the plunge pool with a view of the ocean. The next level up was the rooftop patio with a 360 degree view of the ocean and the lagoons rain forest. My first concern was there was not a King bed for my wife and I After discussing with our front desk person inquiring about changing rooms so we had a King Bed and simply the queen pull out and a roll away. The first response I received was it is Spring Break and we are fully committed. We decided that we would live like Ricky and Lucy my wife and I would sleep in the doubles downstairs and the resort brought a roll away for one of the kids the other sleeping in the queen pull out. Keep in mind this resort is spread out. The lobby and two of the main restaurants are a good walk from the Beach Restaurant and where our room was located. Our room was right near the Beach Beach Pool Bar and Restaurant. The room was a perfect location for our family. While we were having a drink in the lobby bar Daniel Scott Resort Manager sought us out and indicated he would see what he could do to improve our stay. We indicated we were fine and the suite was great no worries. The next morning we headed to breakfast and the beach. The beach is awesome but I will get to that in a moment. I was going to the room to grab a book and there were two staff members leaving the room with tool chests and drills. Interesting they had uninstaled the two double beds and installed a king bed in the master. Keep in mind the doubles were installed into the walls with built in night stands in traditional stained woods. They completely uninstaled the two doubles and installed a very large king with a wood stained headboard to look consistent with the suite decor. The team went over and above and we are very THANKFULWe had such a great time. We took out the complimentary Hobie Cat every day. We rode the Sea Dos went Parasailing. The ocean is warm and clear. Lastly the food and margaritas are excellent.

A great antidote to the slightly humid weather this time of the year. The two adjoining suite were about 70 sq each with so much space that nice can rollers skate across the two rooms. There are wonderful bikes everywhere that you can take up to ride around the property. The two restaurants were wonderful as were the pools. My two teenagers enjoyed the water slide without all the legal papers required in US. Try the water cruise around the property amazing and the jogging walking trails around the vast property.

Beautiful. Too many words to describe the beauty. We visited here with our daughter and had an amazing time. From the moment you enter the property till you leave every need is taken care of. The boat ride to y our villa to meet the butler waiting for you at your dock is magical and just starts the entire mood for your stay. We stayed in a lagoon suite and were so impressed with the details from the plunge pool to the roof top deck and everything in between. The Nespreso machine was very appreciated ask the butler if there is a taste that you prefer for coffee and you will have it well stocked for the rest of the trip same with the fruit bowl. The room overall was well appointed right down to the mini sized robe and slippers that were placed out for our daughter to use. The housekeeping teams at this resort can teach at other resorts hotels on how to maintain rooms and prep them for guests. I think they enjoyed setting up our daughters toys around the room as my daughter did rushing home in the evening to see how they set them up. Every little detail was taken care of in our room and it seemed that the team there learned our quirks and anticipated and took care of our needs before we needed them right down to a bookmark in my book and cleaning wipes left out for sunglasses. Or how they laid out your toiletries on the vanity or how they set out the soap and towels in your outdoor shower or put clothes away for you. just focused on taking almost all tasks off your hands so you can focus on relaxing. The pools were beautiful well staffed and all were family friendly except the spa pool which is adults only. Buckets of iced bottled water were set you to use at your chairs refreshed with ice during the day and on some days they brought out special drinks both alcoholic and non to cover all bases. There was even two types of sunscreen set out at the pools in case you forgot your own. Food was AMAZING from the start of the day to all the restaurants for dinner check out TGIF on Friday nights with Fidel the pastry chef. He makes a grouping of deserts for you and discusses each as he makes them for you something very special for foodies to indulge in. The grounds were stunning and so well maintained. Even when talking to the grounds team you can see the pride in their work and when you talk to them you know that they are as passionate about their workmanship and the beautiful results that they create. While spread out somewhat the ever present trams can shuttle you here and there quickly. If one sees you waiting and it is full they will track the next one down for you so you know how long to wait. The beach is a bit small but in a very nice intimate sense they have some barriers set up that helps with erosion and even if they are not pretty it allowed for a four year old to be in the surf safely. Water activities from sailing to SUPs are free and the crew will help you get out on the water. Even though I missed the chance they will take you out to a part of the reef off the resort to snorkel. Take time to wander this little oasis and make sure you check out the Chefs garden fruit garden and flower garden. All worthwhile places to get lost in. And at night the place is even more magical with hanging lanterns spread through out the trees creating a very romantic atmosphere to enjoy. The details the passion of the staff and dedication from everyone to offer you an amazing experience is not to be missed.

Pretty much what you read in the review is accurate. The resort is beautiful and perfect for our family kids aged 7 and 9. The rooms were out of this world as many stated. I think we would try the ocean view next time just for the noise but our lagoon deluxe suite was perfect for us. A few things that I did not read that I will include for those with kids is that the beach pool is perfect because you can literally be on the deck of the restaurant and see your kids in the ocean or in the pool. it is just a comfortable set up because you do not have to keep moving to keep up with your kids. The sailing paddle boards and canoeing were also so close that the kids were not exhausted just getting there. Our kids can swim well so we could even go to the restaurant and watch the kids in the pool from our table. Keep in mind like other reviews my kids loved the kids club after a couple of days doing nothing but water stuff so we had quiet time from the kids too. The room has an inside shower outside shower and inside bath. That really made it easy to get four people ready in a one bathroom room. I wish that they had bikes for our age kids. I asked about that and they said its insurance reasons and you have to be 17. Seems a little old but our kids did not qualify. We did love the bikes just wished we could have had them for the kids too. We used the sitter two different nights. Again how great that you can use someone they saw in kids club. They walked around got games and loved both nights with Mariane and Silba. We used the spa and it was wonderful and I also took a BOSU class and bare class and both were great. My husband did not realize how nice the spa was so make sure if you like steam rooms saunas etc. that you use it. Many commented about the food. I say it was good and matched the price. I guess I expected good food for the price. So again the ceviche and other items were good but the price was pretty similar to what we would pay at nice restaurant in Chicago. My point is it did not taste like an all inclusive and it was not. As everyone mentioned the service was awesome and everyone seemed so happy. I can not explain why I felt that as we had good service at other places but here they seemed happy. I will say our butler was good but we did not find our family in need of those services as much. Unpacking packing is something I want to do so I know where things are at. She did surprise my daughter with balloons and a bubble bath upon return from the pool. That is totally above and beyond but I called concierge for most of the stuff as plans changed and I hardly saw her at the pool. Again I did not need her because the pool had plenty of service folks ready to take your order bring towels fresh water bottles etc. I think that is it. My review did not list everything but other reviews did so I added on some nice to know items.

The pool next to the main building lobby is supposed to be adult only. There is a kid family pool by the ocean. But when I was there they let a couple with a toddler rent one of the cabanas for the adult only pool. This was particularly frustrating because it was an otherwise quiet pool except for the noise of the toddler and the adults fawning over her. And of course since the couple were paying extra for a cabana. no one from the resort said anything to them about the fact they were breaking the rules. Instead many staff stopped by to see if they or their kid needed anything. I do not know who to find more awful the couple who thought they were too special to abide by the rules or the staff that did not enforce the rules. I did not realize how much this ruined by memory of that vacation until I started planning another one and was carefully reading tripadvisor reviews to see if expensive resorts where you pay over 500 a night actually let adults get away from kids when that is what the hotel has promised.

The entry level rooms are basically a mini cotage I stayed in a lagoon view suite and had my own private pool and dock not to mention a rooftop area to sunbathe outdoor shower indoor shower and one of the largest tubs I have ever seen. The food was great at the beach had ceviche and the main restaurant offered a variety of rancheros but the main Buffet was great. You can grab a bicycle and cruise around the property. I loved the beach it was pristine and there was hardly a resort in site. I felt at home here and found it unique to be next to mangrove trees and a lagoon and then beside a beach within minutes. I recommend this property to anyone couples children families etc. you can not go wrong.", "offset": [263, 498], "date": "2016-10-29 00:00:00", "cpt": "2", "category": "pool"}, {"id": 15, "uid": "9dcffd9b-681a-432f-9f64-076403ceff3d", "sentence": "Remarkable hotel.

From the minute you arrive the staff do everything for you. They could not be more attentive. The butler was excellent arranging our bicycles and answering all our questions. Unfortunately the sea was too rough to swim but the long beach allows for a pleasant stroll. Attentive and professional staff. The availability of bicycles allowed food access to the whole resort. The lake tour on the hotel boat was memorable. The hotel can arrange many visits for example to Playa del Carmen and Dolphin swimming. Our room was near the facility for weddings so it became noisy on 2 of the 3 evenings we stayed.

The biggest problem was the noise from the pool on the top floor.

With such an amazing property there is so much to say. The first thing that comes to mind is you really need a week to see and enjoy all the resort has to offer. However if you stay less than a week it will certainly be some of the best days of your entire life. We have stayed in dozens of these type of high end resorts over the years and the Rosewood is simply the best. A brilliant architectual design cast across thousands of acres you can walk bike ride boat ride or catch a cart ride to your room. I am a swimming pool guy so let \u2019s start there. The beach pool is the poster child for those pools you see on hotel web sites where it is super blue right next to the pure white sand beach along the blue turquoise ocean and there are no people around. Well it \u2019s all true. That was one of the best parts. No screaming kids no Marco Polo no obnoxious people talking loud on their cell phones. Just peace and quiet and amazing service by the staff. Then we have the Quiet Pool which is multi level with a jacuzi beautiful gardens throughout. And every day the staff pass around an complimentary amenity. I received the Tatinger champagne coconut popsicle hummus with veggie sticks and I heard there were many others including a five minute foot massage. And another pool is at the Spa. Tropical garden setting hammocks cabanas water features amazing. And last but not least the private pool at your room patio. Heated to bath water temperature and light jetting to keep the water moving about it looks out onto the lagoon for complete contentment. The Spa is amazing and included with your room cost. Cold plunge Redwood sauna steam room jacuzi deluge shower smoothies juices fruit nuts bottled water all there and included. We had a king suite and it is big enough to live in for the rest of your life. The outdoor shower is liberating and refreshing. And up the spiral stairs is a rooftop deck with large oval day bed for \u201c fun \u201d times. Oh yes and another \u201c best part \u201d is you get a personal butler the entire stay. They are super smart knowledgeable friendly and helpful. Anything you need they will make it happen and you can communicate directly with them using the Rosewood ap. Other things to mention I did the jet ski and it was lightning on water brand new machine cost 80 for a half hour it was awesome. Do n\u2019t suggest a rider on the back. have them get their own because they will just get bounced around especially if you try to gun it at full throttle. Free use of bikes throughout the propertyThe entire place is manicured perfection Eco tour boat rideExcelent WiFi on the entire property Excellent food and beverage everywhere but pricey. The golf course looked amazing but did n\u2019t have enough time. Great food and beach lounging at the food truck on the far left of the beachGarden toursStaf meet and greet reception each night at 630 for complimentary drinks and appetizers that were all high quality and with live music I really can not think of a single thing that they need to improve. And a reminder to calculate in the 19 resort fee and 15 room tax ouchA PIECE OF TRAVEL ADVICE always UPGRADE along in the places you stay as you travel not the other way around. We are now in Tulum in a cabana on the beach. It \u2019s great but no Air Conditioning no Butler and no free Tatinger.

The desire to please is evident in every aspect of the resort. The housekeeping staff has total attention to detail and they do a perfect job. At all the restaurants everyone is friendly and service is exemplary as it is at the pools and beach. If I were forced to say anything that needed improvement it would be that at the \u201c adult \u201d beach the staff is so eager to be helpful I was actually awakened from sleeping twice by someone asking what they could do for me and did we need anything. They should not be waking people upAnd the other area was the butlerthe first3days there our butler changed each day so we never really knew who he was. But also once there was some continuity he never told us about the special dinner in the garden so we missed it entirely and if we did n\u2019t read the daily news would n\u2019t have known about dinner at the beach and other events. The truth is that we have little use for a butler and have found that to be true on other visits but this one was particularly not informative or creative and was more a nuisance than an asset But he was truly of no significance to us we did beautifully without him and had the most wonderful time and look forward to returning for as long as we can and as often as we can. Also an unrelated issue. In very very few places do you have handrails for stairs you could do very attractive ones out of stone and whether on stairs or getting in and out of the water at the pools it can be dangerous particularly on uneven stairs. We know many people who have fallen on stairs and not old people and that \u2019s not a problem you need. Think it would benefit everyone from the plunge pools at the suites to the stairs and pools. It \u2019s a struggle to get out of some of the pools with nothing to pull up on.

I have not had better and friendlier service at any hotel or resort in the world and I have been all over the world. Love the new adult pool area bar restaurant. The dinner events at the new pool area were great. A swim up bar at the new adult pool would have been nice but I recognize it might be hard to create an elegant one that fits in. Also love the new seaweed control net. The bikes and golf carts seemed much nicer they must be new. This was the first time we brought our kids all of the baby items provided in the room were perfect. I particularly liked the bottle cleaner I had not seen that before. The grounds are always kept so well the landscaping looked great. Music at the pool and beach would be nice even if the volume is low.

Stayed at the Rosewood Mayakoba for the first time really lovely trip. The space was elegant and understated. The rooms are far more enchanting in person than they are in the pictures online. We visited with two children and we were all fully satiated. the family pool and beach area is super fun for children the kids club is great the staff is incredible with kids. When the children were in the kids club or with a babysitter there were several relaxing pools to choose from where you were at no risk of being splashed by an errant canonbaler. The La Ceiba garden dinner adults only was spectacular a trip highlight. The sushi restaurant was great. We had an amazing driver Roberto that picked us up at the airport and we asked that he drive us to see mayan ruins on two different days. We were worried about the slightly longer drive with two small children but Roberto had queued up movies and some candy which made our small kids happy and then arranged a fabulous guide at both places. The Rosewood also has a great private concierge service the person assigned to our suite Alberto truly went above and beyond to make everything work perfectly for us. He also made sure we were aware of all of the fun events happening around the property. I can not say enough great things about the staff. Every single person we encountered was friendly engaging and helpful. From the golf cart driver who tried to teach out five year old to roll his Rs to the boat captan who went out of his way to find crocodiles to the Gardner who explained all of the uses of herbs in the herb garden we found the staff to be truly delightful.", "offset": [383, 561], "date": "2020-01-27 00:00:00", "cpt": "2", "category": "pool"}]}
