My husband and I were very impressed because they volunteered and offered for us before we even requested their assistance. It is too bad that we did not get all the names of those who made our stay very pleasant and memorable but we do recall Josephine who checked us in she helped us in finding the Metro which was a 5minute walk from the hotel Alesio and the bellman who assisted us a lot of times during our stay. I should also mention the folks who manned the bar they willingly gave us some ice when we asked for some. Our breakfast lady also willingly accommodated our request for fried eggs. And to our housekeeper lady thanks. Their staff consists of sincere helpful persons. Congratulations to the management for their right choice of peole. I would certainly recommend your property to our friends here in America and in the Phils. My husband works for the Mariot Hotels in the San Francsico area so we know what great service is like.

We stayed at the Pullman Bercy for five nights in one of their Duplex Suite with King Size Bed. It was a lovely 2 floor suite with a loft featuring the king size bed.

A mini refrigerator was also in the room although it did not keep drinks very cold. The room was very warm probably because one whole wall of the room is a 2story window. The views were beautiful but to keep the room reasonably cool we kept the curtains closed. Even still we called for service to the room the first night as it was not cooling down. Reception sent someone up right away he made some adjustments which helped with the room temp. The following night I requested a fan which was brought up to the room right away helped keep things cool for the rest of the stay. Our son used room service a number of times as he was not feeling well enough to venture out with us. He was very pleased with the service food. As mentioned in another recent review the hotel is undergoing renovations but we had no problems with this during our stayit is in a great location with the Village of Bercy just outside the hotels doors. Convenient Metro station cute shops lots of choices for meals. Breakfast was included in our stay but was not anything exciting. Our only complaint during our stay was the odor pumped into the elevator lobby the smell was constant and strong of mens cologne. We noticed it was coming from some sort of plugged in diffuser.

When it was my turn I presented my booking details as well as my platinum membership card. No greetings as a loyal member was given as well as no upgrade. Even for the welcome drink vouchers I had to ask at the end of check in. So the check in experiences compared with other Pullman hotels was not so good. Our room was a family room with two big beds. Nice and clean perfect for our stay. I made my self a cup of tea before we left for the show. After we came back we discovered that the water kettle was spoilt and water was leaking all over the area. Spilling water on some of my documents and my mobile phone luckily the phone was still working. The kettle was exchanged after we complained to the front desk but when we returned to the room after dinner the next problem happened. Our room was without power. So I had to go back to the front desk to ask for help again. We had to wait for 15 minutes till somebody came up to the room just to check on some fuses which caused the problem with the power fail. Next morning we went for breakfast around 0930 hopping to avoid the big Chinese \u2019s travel groups but unfortunately they were still there. So we had to wait for a table and it was very load. Once we had a table we discovered that a lot of breakfast stuff was not available. For example the complete tea section was out of stock glasses were missing at the juice section and lots of food was not available. So the breakfast experience was not very pleasant and we were looking forward to it because we read that Pullman has one of the best breakfasts in town. After my breakfast I wanted to collect my tickets for a river cruise on the Sein which I was included in my room package. Unfortunately the tickets were not ready yet and I was ask to wait another 30 minutes before the responsible person would arrive. Of course I do n\u2019t wanted to wait again so we left without the tickets and bought them latter on directly at the cruise company.
