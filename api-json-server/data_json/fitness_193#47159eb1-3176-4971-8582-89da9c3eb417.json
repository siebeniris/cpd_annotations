According to the pictures and star rating we were expecting much more from the Sheraton Phoenix Downtown. The pool which is on the 4th floor of the hotel leaves much to be desired it \u2019s totally average do n\u2019t be mislead by the pictures the pro are the pool towels. The 4th floor outdoor grill by the pool was closed the entire week we were there with no explanation as to why it was closed. There are no showers by the pool or fitness area. There are no guest laundry facilities. The coffee snack bar in the lobby has the strangest hours seemed like it was never open. Now to the rooms small small small rooms old and outdated is not even the word to describe them. They are filthy dirty. The washrooms need some sort of shelving unit so you have an place to put your stuff especially when traveling as a family of four. The carpet barely if ever gets vacuumed when housekeeping comes it really appears as though they just make the beds and only the towels are replaced in the washroom. The washroom was left with hairs all over the floor and around the toilet area. And we do leave housekeeping a tip. Had to actually speak to front desk about the cleaning and the girl at the front desk gave me attitude. You work in the hospitality business show it. The furniture is old and scratched up. Small TV in the room had issues with the remote. My son met a nice young traveler that week and they became friends so of course you speak of your rooms and apparently the single guy got an upgrade for free to a suite with a walkout on the 4th floor. We had asked for an upgrade because the room is super small for 4 people and were told we would have to pay for a suite. Interesting. Hotel lobby washrooms are nice but you need that quality in the rooms not in the lobby. Checked out other hotels in the area the Renaissance looked amazing and beautiful the Hyat and the Kimpton.

This was just a very disappointing experience. A non existent bell man was also our experience and we had to carry roll our bags quite a distance before we reached check in on the second floor and then all the way to our room. It took several minutes to even get an elevator from the ground to the second floor. A large hotel such as this should have more than 2 small working elevators. Then breakfast it is either an over priced buffet of lukewarm mediocre choices or a breakfast sandwich a bowel of oatmeal or a high fat pastry in the little coffee shop. The concierges lounge is also being renovated so no possible food light refreshment options there either. Then there was the hotel wide internet issue which created monumental challenges for myself and my traveling companion. The phone in the room was very staticky which made it difficult to talk with the front desk and housekeeping staff. AND some of the staff management could really use some remedial training in their communication skilsOn the positive side of things the flat screen TV in our room was great. The roof top pool spa lounge area is also nice however because there are not too many places to go and hang out within the hotel due to this renovation process this area was very crowded the noise level very high and seating very limited.
