Hotel service is good but the property is showing its age. I did a lot of research on a hotel for my mothers visit to London. We were looking for 5 star properties so based on good reviews and the brand reputation she loves Mandarin Oriental I booked Mandarin Oriental. The reviews here are fair that it is a very good property service is also good but I must say that it is showing its age and I can not say it is very good value for moneywhat is good it is very luxurious and old school. Room was really nice large I like the layout a lot the bed was very comfortable and the furnishings were traditional and lovely. Bathroom is large with a slightly modern look. Great water pressure and temperature. The pool and fitness center is so nice. The spa was fantastic too but I have been to the Corinthia spa and I must say that was much better and bigger. The massage treatment I had was pretty good here. Dinner by Heston Blumenthal is a highlight. I really like this restaurant. Fantastic service excellent food and lively fun and unpretentious atmosphere. They do not have a tasting menu so you can do a la carte. Breakfast is served in the same room in the morning and the view of the park is really nice. The continental buffet breakfast is great and has a solid selection. Service was equally good during the breakfast service. We ordered room service breakfast twice during our stay. Amazing. Great service beautiful presentation the cart becomes your dining table and it is very spacious. I was impressed. Get the Japanese breakfast set. Deliciouswhat is bad. Front door men were not very friendly and not prompt in helping you. They were in fact more friendly and useful when you wanted to check out and leave than upon arrival. Service was mostly good but inconsistent. The check in process was smooth and efficient but we were not really informed about the property and what is available. When we walked in the front door no one greeted us or informed us about where the reception desk was. it is not very obvious. At the Mandarin Oriental in Tokyo they have people everywhere greeting you constantly and by name. I miss the Mandarin Oriental service in Asia. We had to call maintenance to our room to fix things on 3 occasions. They did not apologize for any of the issues and it goes to show how much the rooms are showing their age. Last issue was that I e mailed the Concierge before my stay about a restaurant reservation. No response. I had to follow up.

I know they are renovating the rooms but they are not available yet. The room was a king room overlooking Hyde park. A lot more expensive than similar 5 star hotels. The room was very tired looking shabby round the edges scratches marks spy hole spins pictures on the wall not straight fixed slightly off so one can not correct etc. We had an okay stay but if you are looking for top end luxury this is not the place. Some of the detail that they messed up on. Asked by phone before we got there if there was anything we would like i requested tea making facilities in the room and the bed made with sheets and a blanket instead of a duvet. Neither was done. We requested again the bed making and this was done at turn down. Unfortunately the blanket was not big enough and we wrestled for it over night. The next day the bed was made with the blanket the wrong way round so that it did nt even reach the sides of the bed. We thought about turning it but instead deciding to leave early not staying the other night. The tea making turned up a day late. We ordered a cooked breakfast in our room it arrived but we only had one chair in the room. The delivery man asked if we would like another chair I accepted only to be told it would take 10 15 minutes. Not much use with our breakfast getting cold. So I sat on the bed to eat. The TV was okay for an hour or so then every 3 to 4 minutes crackled and messed the picture up for 5 seconds. Annoying but not bad enough to request a replacement TV. The room had a balcony but was a bit dirty and rough I guess it is not used much. The room only came with one robe when there two of us. There was no complimentary water in the room. So we had some from the mini bar. The good things were free gifts of a chocolate easter egg as we were staying over Easter I guess. The concierge responded brilliantly to my enquiry about the availability of the new renovated rooms some ready in the summer. He showed us personally an example suite on the 3rd floor. They look very smart. The staff were friendly and responsive. Although being asked if we were enjoying London encouraging us into conversation by every staff got a bit tiring after a while. On check out the lady asked about our stay. I told her and she was sorry that we did not have the best of stays. They added a voluntary service charge of 5 on the cost of the room. In the circumstances I asked for it to be removed which she duly did and agreed. She asked if they could do anything I suggested the manager may email me to explain. apologise maybe. She said she would pass it on. No one came back to me. The main entrance is presently closed so the entrance is presently on the side. Going through a few corridors to get to the main reception. This in itself is no problem however their is no signage to help you leave which was a bit confusing. We saw another party wondering the halls trying to leave as well. A couple of signs would solve that problem. All in all we DID have a reasonable stay with no major problems. It is just when you pay that much I would have not expected those issues.

In a city with plenty of hotels that are high end in quality and price the Mandarin Oriental ranks high in both categories. As such it \u2019s great if you \u2019re visiting on an unlimited expense account or happen to be independently wealthy neither of which we are but that \u2019s another story. We were here for 5 nights shortly after they reopened from their renovation rates varied each night from \u00a3 840 to \u00a3 1040Our room was well appointed with nice lighting a large flat screen TV plenty of hanging space and drawers for clothes and a nice bathroom with heated toilet seat heated towel rack and an overhead \u201c rain \u201d shower head. The only \u201c downside \u201d if there was one would be that it had just one window which opened onto an interior courtyard. good I suppose for avoiding street noise but not as bright as it might \u2019ve been on the outside of the hotel. This is not a place were you \u2019l get away with being anonymous. you \u2019l probably need to acknowledge at least 3 hotel staff members as you exit the place and will be greeted by 4 or more upon returning. I realize everybody \u2019s just bending over backwards to be helpful and friendly but I found their exceptionally eager greetings to be just a bit \u201c over the top \u201d. I mean sometimes I just want to walk through a lobby in peace. In terms of location it \u2019s right next to the Knightsbridge tube stop on the Picadily line which comes straight in from Heathrow Zone 6 to Zone 1 about \u00a3 610 peak or \u00a3 310 off peak if using an Oyster Card. So that \u2019s convenient other than the fact that you \u2019l likely have to haul your luggage up several flights of steps before you reach earth \u2019s surface.

Food in the French Bistro was very good a nice selection for the significant price you \u2019d expect at a hotel like this. There are a couple of pubs pretty close Paxton Head and The Gloucester. There \u2019s also a pretty good little restaurant I found called The Kitchen of London that offers a variety of takeout food which we patronized a few times burgers pastas salads and more. For groceries there \u2019s a Sainsbury \u2019s down past Harod\u2019s. As far as tourist sites go the hotel is right across the street from Hyde Park which is adjacent to Kensington Garden Palace. A walk east to Hyde Park Corner also takes you to Wellington Arch and then you \u2019re just a pleasant walk along Constitution Hill and Green Park to Buckingham Palace and more tourists with whom you can hang out. And once you \u2019re at The Buck why not keep going and stroll through St James \u2019 Park. maybe go see some more tourists at Trafalgar Square Picadily Circus Chinatown and Covent Garden.", "offset": [331, 668], "date": "2019-06-24", "cpt": "1", "category": "room"}, {"id": 17, "uid": "bf32277b-fd29-4444-941b-56abef3c679e", "sentence": "Phenomenal.

At reception I was greeted by a very enthusiastic member of reception by the name of Vanessa who was very polite always smiled and made check in very quick and simple with that professionalism.

The room was spacious comfortable and house keeping clearly have a perfect team as I could n\u2019t fault the condition of the cleanliness of the room. I was in the Berkeley Suite with views of Knightsbridge. The room was incredibly quiet I could n\u2019t fault the amenities within the room.

The controls of the air conditioning and lightening were simple to use and the climate set on entering the room was perfect at 21 degrees. The main bathroom was perfect. The marble floors in both bathrooms were heated. The bath was so comfortable and the walk in shower with the powerful monsoon shower head was out of this world. The turn down service was lovely to return from dinner to see that my bed had been turned down the good night floor mat behind the bed with a set of slippers and a night time beauty sleep box by Neom containing face oil pillow mist and an eye mask.
