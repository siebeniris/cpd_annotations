Not sure how they are able to hang a Radison sign on this place. Very little about this hotel will remind you of a Radison Hotel. MANY renovations are necessary here. It would appear that ownership sucks this place dry. There needs to be an injection of cash into this place. The carpeting in my room as well as the hallways was very stained and quite nasty looking. Just a very outdated rundown hotel. The topper to this stay was the breakfast. The same breakfast that is included in MANY of the hotels that I stay in include this same breakfast at no additional charge. This place will charge you around 1250. Better off spending the 1250 for a real breakfast down the road.

Nice clean room. My only negative comment is that the lobby breakfast area should have a sign posted stating that the breakfast is not free. I looked back at the booking information and sure enough it says the breakfast will cost 1295. The last time I looked at that was one month before we arrived so I forgot about having to pay for breakfast. That was my fault. But the way it is set up it looks to be just like every other free continental breakfast. Jonathan the breakfast attendant was superb. Very friendly.

We stayed recently for week in Radison. We felt that this Hotel needs to improve a lot in many areas. For example when we got the quotation we got it with Breakfast but during Check in the hotel guy said that there was no Breakfast included in the tariff. We had to show them our booking and get the Breakfast coupons. I placed the breakfast coupons in my room near the TV. Seemingly the Housekeeping staff threw them considering as trash. I explained this to the Hotel Front Desk and asked them to give me the duplicate breakfast coupons. They said they will give but did not give them. Rather I was expected to explain this daily during the Breakfast time and take the breakfast. First of all the Housekeeping people should be able to recognize the coupons and should not throw them. Next when I explained this to the Front Desk people they should give me the coupons without any hesitations. Here they promised to give but acted as if they forgot to give. Coming to the food the breakfast was very limited in options. The Supposed to be fresh fruit was never fresh. We felt that the fruit was always a stale fruit. Also the muffins and cakes they had were seemingly not that fresh. They keep Fried Potato but sometimes they mix it with some kind of meat so one has to be very careful before taking Potato if he. she is a pure vegetarian. Only thing I liked about this hotel is their Shuttle Drop and Pickup service.
