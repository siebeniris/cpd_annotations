Went for a long weekend with kids ages 2 and 6. A very mixed experience. Excellent location nice facilities great pool if you do not mind relentless dance music. But customer service needs work. Sometimes excellent but when things went wrong we got excuses and BS not I am so sorry let me see what I can do for you. Arrived 130am and were told our room was not ready come back in 15 hr. No prob. At 2 pm we are told it will not be ready until 3. At 3 it was still not ready. We got irate. we had a toddler who was up at 5 am for a flight and desperately needed a nap. We repeated we had originally been told 15hr agent response was I do not know I was not there. Asked to speak to a manager who got us a room. When our kids french toast was took a long time at breakfast a waiter said That usually takes 35 minutes. I told him it had not taken that long the day before. 35 minutes for french toast. Other minor things we set the room thermostat to 75 deg but AC would not shut off and we kept windows open to be warm enough. Rrestaurant had only 3 high chairs though there were 4 or 5 families with toddlers staying there. Bottom line. This hotel could be a great place when they get the kinks worked out in customer service. Meanwhile be prepared to weather a few problems esp. if you have young kids.", "offset": [47, 94], "date": "2016-02-13", "cpt": "0", "category": "general"}, {"id": 3, "uid": "8033301f-7b25-472a-a7fe-445f360e65a1", "sentence": "I have been travelling to South Beach for 16 years and through experience have narrowed my list of preferred hotels down to two. However I only had the opportunity to stay for one night this week and did not feel like paying 500 or more a night for a room I would spend little time in. That being said I did not want to trade off in rate for a lesser experience. Nautilus is advertising opening rates as they opened just 4 months ago. I took a chance and was extremely glad I did. The hotel is in a great location on the beach on Collins near Lincoln Road mall and not too far of a walk to the restaurants on Ocean. The hotel is not pretentious and does not try to hard to be hip. The vibe is just right. The lobby is a nice wide open space with a sunken bar and the onsite restaurant was very good although not crowded. I really enjoyed my experience at the pool. There were plenty of chairs and it seems the staff does a really good job cleaning up empty chairs discouraging the type of people that try and save chairs. Now on to the room. I stayed in a King Superior and it was nice and roomy and did not feel at all cramped like many other art deco restored hotels. The bathroom is on the small side but I had rather have a smaller bathroom and bigger room. The bed was firm and unbelievably comfortable. I really look forward to visiting the Nautilus when I have more time.", "offset": [1262, 1308], "date": "2016-02-22", "cpt": "0", "category": "general"}, {"id": 4, "uid": "01503212-3bb6-4d33-a853-36f7b0c0a59e", "sentence": "It was a lovely hotel in a great location. With the 25 resort fee you also have access to bikes. The restaurant staff were just ok. For some reason it took forever to get a menu if you were not seated my the hostess. If you come from the pool you would not go thru the front entrance. Another oddity was the bar staff at the pool bar charged different prices for drinks. One day my margarita was 14 the next day it was 20. The front dress was great at resolving any issues. Loved that our beach access and chairs came At no extra cost. And young doorman Fabio was by far our favourite staff member. Location on Collins was perfect. We walked everywhere.

We spent 4 days at the Nautilus for a quick getaway. The lobby was beautiful and our room was ready at 10AM. it was great we could start our day without waiting until the 3PM check in time. The rooms were nicely decorated and had the Miami vibe. If you are looking for a room with a view make sure you upgrade. The standard room gave us a view of another buildings air conditioning unit no balcony. We did have an issue with our AC not working. When we called for help the service men came to our room very quickly but the problem still was not fixed. Tough sleeping in that Miami humidity with no relief. If you are looking for a quiet hotel while sleeping this is not the place for you. You can hear everyone around you including the people above your room. We were on the 4th floor. The pool area is beautiful and so was the beach with crystal blue water. Every day we would head to the beach around 2PM and there were no towels or change available if you wanted to rent an umbrella. Highly disappointing considering you are charged a daily resort fee and you can not even get a towel on the beach. The excuse was they were waiting for the truck to come in. Location was great and close walking distance to Lincoln Rd for shopping and Ocean Drive for music drinks and food. Finally the staff at this hotel was very attentive and helpful. They work very hard in the blistering heat all day long to make your stay enjoyable.

Pool and staff were excellent drinks were yummy and the free fruit infused water polside was a plus on a scorching Miami afternoon. The music playing be the pool was not too loud just enjoyable and an eclectic mix of Brazilian jazz dance tropical you name it. Very relaxing. Restaurant was a bit overpriced but everything we ate was really fresh and baked at hotel. Blueberry scones and passion fruit donuts are made to order and take a while but so worth itThe hotel itself is immaculate and smells amazing. I tried buying a similar scent in the gift shop but nothing was comparable. Location is perfect for families and couples seeking a low key atmosphere. It is a quick walk to Lincoln Rd shops which get more high end as you walk down. Stay away from Ocean drive if you have children. It was seedy and touristy. I was approached by drug dealers on more than one occasion.

I spent few days at the hotel during the thanksgiving event. First the location is nearly perfect Close to Ocean drive and all attractions and still has access to private beach area and has a nice pool. However I would recommend staying at a similarly priced Shore Club next door which has a much better ambience. One of the negatives for me was that it had lots of children and strollers The biggest problem was low quality internet connection slow and flaky. Do n\u2019t expect any work done which requires good Wi Fi. Facilities need some upgrade. One of the elevators was out of service on town days creating lines to the elevator. Another aspect of SobA hotels which is probably unavoidable in Miami is hidden costs. There is a 30 daily room surcharge. Minibar is very expensive eg 6 for a small bottle of water. Stuff can be nice or not depending on the person. Most are very helpful. However I had a problem with a male bartender. They give you Expedia VIP drinking tickets this is all you get. but somehow this ended up on my bill 30 for two cocktails.
