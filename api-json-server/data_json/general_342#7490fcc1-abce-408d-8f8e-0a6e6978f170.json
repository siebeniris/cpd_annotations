So many great memories. I used to book business functions at their San Francisco location often many owners back. I needed a room in Newport even though I live locally as work was being done at my home. I made the reservation thru their phone reservation line. They quoted me 243 a night with no mention of the 30 dollar required parking fee as there is no self parking there used to be. My bill was 20. When I checked out with taxes etc. I mentioned that I was a Presidents Club member their frequent stay program which in other locations offers an upgraded room if available free gym use free wifi and a few other perks. This location only offers free wifi to Presidents Club members and charges all others unles you are in a public area. What struck me most about this hotel was that I saw room service trays on my floor and the same ones when I checked in and when I left. The same trays. There was an eaten yogurt cup on the carpet which I observed two employees walk right past without even stopping to pick up and throw away. I picked it up and threw out so that it would not ruin the carpet as it had fallen over. The room was nice and well maintained. Most Fairmonts always strike me as five star in all regards this one not so much. Not bad just average thus I am not complaining just making observations. I did not interact with any personnel except at check in and that was uneventful. If you are a light sleeper you do hear any and all voices in the hallway. I have always wondered why hotels do not have a standing sign in the hallways saying Just a reminder guests sleeping kindly keep voices down. Thank You. Not all guests are conscious of their voices carrying and awakening others unmeaningly it would serve as a polite reminder.

I stayed here with three friends on a girls trip. We booked for a phenomenal price and were impressed with the service we received. Two of us are very familiar with Southern California but were traveling with two who had never been so we wanted someplace centrally located but not over the top. The room and beds were very small. We knew that going in and did not spend a lot of time in our room but they were clean and well cared for. The pool area was amazing. We were there early spring but it was quite warm one day and there were several business people working by the pool as we lounged. It was quiet and peaceful perfect for our last full day before heading back home to families and work. The hotel is in a great location for shopping and dining not in the heart of anything other than business and close to the airport so that was heavenly. We used the shuttle to and from the airport. We got in very late so we took the shuttle to the hotel that night then went back and got a car the next day. It is also right across the street from Jamba Juice which provided our brunch daily during our trip. The one downside was the mandatory valet. It adds to your daily price but also is horrid if you have visitors. Family came to see us and we had her park off site and went and got her.
