Hyat used to be my first choice for family vacations until now. Beware this hotel is currently under heavy renovation both inside and outside. it is like staying at a construction site. I am attaching some pictures to give you some idea. No front driveway no lobby no atrium no pool dusty garage no bellboy to help us unload luggage. And to top it off you hear jackhammers working 9 am to 4 pm daily. I booked two rooms directly from the Hyat website and even talked to them two days before arrival to confirm. I was not informed in any way that the hotel was under massive renovation. I understand this old hotel needs renovating but it is NOT okay not to disclose it to your guests beforehand. Seeing such a mess was a total shock to me when we arrived. My elderly father was looking forward to meeting up with some old high school friends and relaxing at the hotel the next day. Instead he was told to expect loud construction noises for 7 hours. We talked to a few other guests at the hotel and they were very unhappy as well. I would like to give thanks to Neil the manager here. He tried very hard to accommodate my dads reunion. He arranged a quieter location on a higher floor for my dad and his friends to carry on a conversation comfortably. The first star I offer here is just for Neil. The second star is for the location of the hotel. It is right above the Bethesda Metro station and is within walking distance to lots of restaurants and a grocery store Safeway. A gas station is within a couple of blocks. This hotel does not deserve any more star in the current situation. The room is old and very basic. They did not do a good job cleaning the bathroom either. Maybe after the renovation the hotel will be more appealing. But how Hyat handled the current situation was very disappointing. They should have been truthful about the hotels current state on their web site. They should have allowed potential customers to make an informed decision. You can not just lure your guest in using old pictures and then give them a handout at check in apologizing for the inconvenience.
