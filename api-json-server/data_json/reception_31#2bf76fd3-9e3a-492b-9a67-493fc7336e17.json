The business center has accommodating PC and Macintosh machines and all necessary utencils. The room service offers a unique oriental domestic menu not so pricey and timely careful service.

My husband and I stayed one night at the Mandarin pre cruise. This is one of the best of not the best hotel experiences I have ever had. The hotel itself is beautiful elegant understated. Very classy yet not pretentious. Everyone with whom we dealt was gracious and welcoming. The bellman and the front desk clerk greeted us by name while we were there. The room was large we stayed in a Mandarin room with two beds a desk and a small sofa. Nicely appointed. The bathroom was palatial with a Jacuzi tub and a large walk in shower. The room faced the back of the hotel ie it did not face Boyleston and was on the 5th floor. Quiet as a tomb. We had drinks in the bar of the restaurant at the hotel which was a pretty cool looking place. It was very busy a Friday night with A game going on at Fenway. Reservations for dinner would have been needed I am sure. We took the hotel car to our restaurant for dinner no charge for the car but we did tip the driver. The location can not be beat. We managed to walk about everywhere in the short time we were in Boston.

I chose this as a convenient location to stay and for use of the conference facilities. The hotel is located in a very central place although I did not have time to take advantage of the shopping and dining within close proximity. RomsCheck in was easy and convenient and my room was beautiful and spacious. When you entered the room there is a long hallway foyer that had a mini bar area with a fridge. The hallway proceeded to the bedroom and living room area. I had a king room and the bed shared a large space with a well appointed desk area and a couch TV viewing area. My room had a walk in closet that had a ton of room. It had a lot of amenities such as an area to clean your shoes an umbrella flash light bench and ironing set up. Just beyond the closet was a very large and beautiful bathroom. It had a large sink area stand alone shower huge tub and separate area for the toilet. Each had separate toiletries robes and slippers were included and it was very nice overall. They had a turn down service at night that included a warm cookie and the bed and linens were very comfortable. ServiceWe experienced inconsistent service during our stay. We had called in advance and made arrangements for our conference service food and drinks but clearly there was a miscomunication. They removed our drinks and only had a very small offering for us. We ended up having to order individually off of the menu for dinner and it took a long time to receive our orders on multiple occasions. We had to follow up several times both in the evening and the next day during our meetings to get our service and this was service that we were paying a premium for. We had the very unfortunate circumstance that there was a fire alarm in the middle of the night. After 20 am the alarm and intercom system went off in the room about 4 5 times with conflicting information proceed to the fire exit stay in your rooms over and over. It was scary to begin with and completely disrupting but appeared to be a real issue with the Boston Fire Department. I assumed that the front desk would have at least addressed it or apologized the next morning but they did not say anything about it. However some of the individuals that I met during my stay were very accommodating and friendly. So overall it was just inconsistent. FodThey have a restaurant and bar on site and room service available. The food was good but pricey. Room service breakfast was 32 for two eggs meat choice and toast omelet 20 steak and eggs 29. They also had many other options including quiche smoked salmon with bagel Arabic or Asian breakfasts and a la carte options. The wi fi worked well and we had it included as part of our conference. Otherwise the rates are 5 hour or 15 day unles you book directly through their website. Pricey.

The rooms are luxurious enough and the beds comfortable as they should be at a Mandarin. There are sadly no words adequate enough to describe the stunningly embarrassing service from the senior management of this hotel. No where in the world in a supposed business hotel could your be forced to put up with such dire levels of service.
