The hotel lobby and the beach were beautiful and the onsite dive shop was top notch and very convenient as they even had lockers to clean and store your gear overnight.

We went out on the dive boat 3 days ate in the restaurant many times and visited the executive lounge daily. Every experience was pleasant and welcoming.

My husband and I chose this hotel to celebrate our 6th anniversary because we had stayed here in 2012 and loved it. Let me start off by saying that this stay Sept 20 27 2015 was even better. From the minute we entered the renovated lobby we felt as though we were home. Laura guest services agent was so friendly at check in. When she saw a note on our reservation that it was our anniversary she immediately said Happy Anniversary. I will be arranging for something in your room from our hotel. Our room was not quite ready so we left our luggage with Laura and headed to Captain Blights bar for the first drink of our trip. Laura came over with the bellman Sven as soon as our room was ready. Laura remembered us by name and went out of her way to ask us about our days every time she saw us. The amenity that was sent to our room was amazing thank you Laura. While we were having dinner at the beach bq our first night the Assistant Food and Beverage Manager Amadou personally visited our table and greeted us by name and wished us a happy anniversary. He also told us about the upcoming renovations and was very proud of his staff and the hotel. We had chosen a 5th floor ocean view room well worth it. Our room was clean and we loved the view from room 521. We had breakfast and snacks in the executive lounge every day and the staff there treated us like family Petcha Dawn Ari I can not wait to see pictures of your baby. and especially Karen. These ladies are the faces of hospitality I am a hotel director of sales and know how guests should be treated. Anything we asked about on the island the ladies we knowledgeable and knew where to send us. Karen in particular became a new friend for me. Some day our paths will cross again my sweet friend. I miss my lady friends from the lounge and wish I was there right now with all of themWe did rent a car and explored a lot of the island during our week in Curacao. This hotel is a quick 5 7 minute drive from Wilemstad. We did spend our last day at the beach at the Hilton and enjoyed it we snorkeled and saw quite a few fish so I am a bit confused at the review that said they did not see alot of fish there.

It was probably the worst Hilton experience ever mind you the setting is lovely great beach area convenient to Wilemsted and a few of the hotel staff were helpful and gracious shout out to Fiona at the front desk. But overall the property needs a redo PDQ. But most importantly the staff needs serious training on customer service. No matter what you asked for the answer was No. And the food choices are limited and not really very good. I am a Hilton Honors Member yet I oftentimes had to remind the staff that breakfast was included. I also had an issue with the water trickling out of the faucet in the bathroom sink. I asked for it be fixed. I had to ask twice over a 12 hour period before anything was done about it and when it was fixed it was still a very weak stream of water. The maintenance man was nice but the result was still frustrating. We were traveling with a friend who had a separate room. She had to ask for the room to be cleaned several times and at one point she was told they could not clean her room because they were busy cleaning rooms for guests who were arriving. Really. A guest who is here has been here several days has to wait to have the room cleaned because they are cleaning rooms for arriving guests.

We just returned from a six night stay at the Hilton in Curacao. There are some good and bad things about this hotel. Most of the reviews I read before booking this hotel were accurate. I booked the hotel through Orbits because of the 104 144 after taxes and fees price that was being offered. The positives are that is it \u2019s located on an awesome property with several nice places to eat drink and relax. The beach and pool are amazing. It was n\u2019t crowded so we did n\u2019t have to worry about getting a hut on the beach or chairs by the pool. The water is super clear and blue and the pool was well maintained. The staff is very friendly and accommodating to your needs. The food was great. We tried the breakfast buffet the first morning 20 per person which had a good variety of fresh cooked eggs meat breads and fruit. We also ate at the bar outside the lobby on several occasions and each time the meals were excellent. The prices are not too high. Lunch and drinks for four of us was around 80. Note that it seems that most of the beers you order in Curacao are smaller than 12 ounces. Hilton serves Montana on draft which is brewed in Curacao and was my favorite out of the other beers I drank Polar Amstel Bright Brion. American dollars are widely accepted and the checks have the total in local and American amounts. Now for the not so good items it seems the building and rooms are in need of some maintenance much like my review of the Key Largo Hilton. Our room faced the inland and the view was marginal. There was rust on some of the metal fixtures and refrigerator. There was no hot water in the shower. On a few days we did get warmer water which meant you were n\u2019t shivering. Our first room did not have a hair dryer or a clock when we arrived. I had to ask the front desk for these items. The next morning I asked to upgrade to a beach side room so at least we had a better view. I was able to switch for an extra fee and the view was perfect. The rooms have walk out patios with 2 chairs. It was a nice place to relax in the morning or evening. The refrigerator was small but held some drinks. The air conditioner only had two settings on or off. The first room we had offered a temperature adjustment which did n\u2019t seem to work correctly. The other inconvenience is that twice during our stay our room keys just stopped working and we had to go the front desk to get them re programmed. You also need a room key to operate the lights in the room. The daily room cleaning was good. One nice thing about the building is the elevators which are very responsive and fast. I will give this hotel a 3 star rating with most of the rating coming from the grounds amenities food quality and friendly staff. This hotel could easily be four stars with some room updates. That being said it \u2019s Curacao so you wo n\u2019t spend much time in your room.

I got ta say I absolutely loved traveling by myself and would go back to Curacao in a heartbeat. It was safe relaxing and I was never bored. Overall everything was wonderful. My room was great with an amazing view. I had upgraded to the executive floor which gave me access to the executive lounge. For me I would not do that again. There was nothing wrong with it but I found that I did not make much use of it. I will say that when I did go in the morning I met some great families and had some wonderful conversations. Also the woman working in the lounge was always friendly and smiling. In fact every employee I encountered with the exception of the cashier at the casino was beyond friendly. No matter what review you read on here everyone pretty much agrees their staff is top notch. I work in the hotel industry and I would kill to have staff as outgoing accommodating and pleasant as the staff here. The property itself is gorgeous. Every day I would lay on the beach andor snorkel. I never grew tired of it and it pained me to check out. Captain Blighs bar was my go to most nights for dinner and a couple drinks. I am not one for fancy foods so I was perfectly happy getting a pizza at the bar while reading a book and sipping a cocktail. There was live entertainment a couple nights that was excellent. I also ate at the Italian restaurant on property. It was good but a little garlicky for my taste. If there was one con it would be the shower temperature. This seems to be an ongoing issue but the staff was apologetic and issued a credit to my room for the inconvenience. It was not unbearable but it certainly guaranteed that I took quick showersI would highly recommend doing a boat tour while you are there. I did Bounty Adventures full day trip to Klein Curacao through the resort and it was awesome. Great boat trip great crew and the snorkeling at the island was gorgeous. I even swam with a couple big turtles. I do not recommend taking the shuttle into town. Punda Wilemstad shopping was not much to write home about. Yes the buildings are painted beautiful colors and it is pretty to look at but when it comes down to it it is pretty much all tourist shops. it is where the cruise ships dock and every store is basically the same touristy crap. I am not a huge shopper and when I do shop it is not in stores like that. Honestly it was the only time I did not enjoy myself during my entire week. I would definitely recommend taking a trip to Curacao and I have every intention of returning next year. I had also recommend staying at the Hilton. it is not a Ritz and it is a little older but the staff view and property certainly make up for any shortcomings including cold showers.

Prior to arriving I was notified of a complimentary Diamond member upgrade into a Junior Ocean View Suite. Amazing. Special shout out to Santiago for looking into reservation and accommodating a stellar room. Did run into a couple minor issues at property. Had an unpleasant experience with some rude ladies at a tour desk which I was later informed are third party and not Hilton employees. However Kiara still went out of her way to set up a special dinner for the family. Thank you so much for fixing the situation and promptly. Beyond great management at this location. The executive lounge is a gem at this property. The view from the terrace overlooking the pool and beach is breathtaking to say the least. In the evenings they have wine and cocktails and it makes sitting on the terrace enjoying a glass of wine so special. The staff is truly exceptional by the end of our trip we wanted to bring each of them back home with us. We love Karen. 3 There are two different beach options at the property. The visible one from rooms is smaller but still superbly clean. The second beach is a short stroll down a paved path and is much wider and the water seemed warmer being in a shallow part of ocean.

There are a fair number of palapas on the beach for shade on a first come first served basis.

The Lobby very plain no wow factor you would expect from a Hilton We paid for an ocean view. Our room was on 1st floor it was a view of playground and the kitchen staff moving carts and a small view of the sea Everything in the room was old ugly crack floors dirty carpet the room needs total remake. We checked in late so i went to the lobby and the front desk had only one person working she apologized and said she did not have a room with a view that she would try to move us in the morning. I ask again the next morning and was told to wait one more day and i would have a great view The next morning was Sunday was woken by yelling kids at 630 am because the door was so old it felt like the kids were in my room. The front desk manger apologized and gave 2 free dinners but had to wait till 4 pm for new room. So we get moved to 3rd floor the hall way smells like puke very old carpets with puke stains the room smelled but did have a great view so we had to choose smell or view. we choose view but the room was in disrepair no cold water to wash face brush teeth nasty old bed missing door chain on balcony cracked tiles dirty carpet and THE SMELL. The casino staff was cold and not friendly dark and negative vibe. So if you like a nasty smell and old not maintained rooms with a nice view 3rd floor or higher than book it. Staff and. Landscape grounds. beach small but nice. Pool was nice They need to replace the entire hotel from the ground up. Rent shop for beach water activities bar and 2 restaurant gym and coffee shop.

After considering not posting my review because it was so bad I reconsidered after hearing from others on the flight back that they had a very similar experience. So here is my review in the form of an open letter to the manager. Dear Stephane Thank you for the invite for drinks and happy hour with the manager at the beach bar. I did not accept. And I will explain why. Instead of buying guests a drink how about investing that money and steam clean the carpets in the room to remove a decade or more of crap that has collected on it and leaves the sole of your feet black when you walk the short distance from the bed to the desk. How about investing in a lamp on the desk in the rooms so it can actually be used as a desk. Maybe even a new weather strip on the shower door so that the bathroom door is not rusted through and through. How about a new lamp on the night stand so a guest does n\u2019t have to stare at one that is totally mold stained. How about slapping some fresh paint on the exterior of the building so tourists do n\u2019t immediately associate this with a dilapidated abandoned building as they drive up. See there is so much more to do than boozing it up. With the exception of Desire in the Executive Lounge your staff was how do I say it \u2026. Utterly shameful. I was going to use another word but it is not proper if read by a minor. So to make it very clear Desire is a shining star and would still be if she were amongst a crew of very capable people. You leave the front desk staffed with very nice people. But all are young fresh interns who have not a clue and take 20 minutes to check you in. That is nuts. So instead of throwing parties start managing. My colleague and I had two rooms. He fell flat on his back entering his because water had started dripping from the ceiling in the bathroom and made the polished tile in there ultra slippery. Stephane you should be ashamed of yourself. How can any person hold his head high and say he is manager of such a dive. It is baffling that the Hilton brand is even remotely associated with this hotel. They would be embarrassed if they knew how disgusting your hotel really is. And the saddest part is this is what tourists will leave with from Curacao. There are so many other islands to choose from. Your incompetence not only ruins the Hilton brand it ruins the Curacao brand.

My husband and I travel constantly for work and pleasure so we are pretty used to Mariot hotels and the services that they offer. We travelled with our two children 7 and 9First this hotel is beautiful. the rooms are modern clean and fresh the pool area is spacious with lots of deck chairs seemingly enough for everyone and lots of little corners and nooks in the pool itself. The beach is lovely and though the water is a bit rough we were still easily able to do some fairly decent snorkeling right in front of the hotel. Nice sand and no vendors on the beach. If you have access to the Reef Club it is awesome great snacks and drinks and Gesmeline. I probably got the spelling wrong. is a true professional in client service and made everyone feel like nothing is a problem or too much work and while we were there we witnessed one overbearing group make some pretty ludacris and unreasonable requests. Watching her glide through these situations was a master class in service and though I am sure she minded she did not let on. She made my our children feel very special and they fell in love with her. All of the staff in the Reef Club and across the resort were exceptional. One small unpleasant moment our pool chairs were given away by pool staff was quickly fixed and made right by providing an umbrella where we had to relocate and apologies too so it was impossible to be mad. 5 stars we will be back.", "offset": [1209, 1415], "date": "2020-03-11", "cpt": "2", "category": "reception"}]}
