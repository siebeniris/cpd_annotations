My niece and I stayed for two nights at the Motif and we were thrilled with our choice. The rate was so reasonable that we were not expecting all the luxury we received. A spacious spotless beautiful room with a great view and all necessary amenities. The plate sized rainstorm shower was so enjoyable like a relaxing massage. The beds were extremely comfortable. There were even luxurious robes in the closet. The staff were unfailingly courteous helpful and friendly. All that and a positively unbeatable location important because of our time constraints. The hotel is in the middle of everywhere you want to be in Seattle just blocks from Pike Place Market Westlake Center thus the Monorail to Seattle Center and rail transport to SEATAC Seattle Art Museum great shopping and restaurants and bus stops to further locales like Pioneer Square Capitol Hill etc. It will always be my first choice for stays in Seattle.", "offset": [595, 898], "date": "2015-03-21", "cpt": "0", "category": "restaurant"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "f06964f4-c5d9-4fa2-b188-97375ca11338", "sentence": "Stylish. If you are looking for a cool hotel in downtown Seattle this is a winner. Situated just a few blocks from Pike Market and major stations such as Westlake and Convention Centre it is in an ideal location to explore Seattle. Hotel rooms are spacious and have some great views of Lake Union Puget Sound and the beds are really comfy. The shower was absolutely amazing as others have said. My only complaint would be the drainage. Even just having a light shave it seemed to take an eternity for water to drain and took forever after having a shower for the water to go away.

Motif Seattle is a solid hotel situated in a great location along Pike street and 5th avenue. Whether coming for business or vacation the location of the hotel is really what stands out. Its located within walking distance to the rail link Pike Place Market and various cafes bars and restaurants. Additionally there is an abundant of shopping high end stores nearby. Check in was very quick and easy and was accompanied by a free glass of wine. The lobby itself is large with plenty of seating. The rooftop bar had a nice relaxed ambiance though the food was only mediocre. I had the pulled pork sliders. I thought it was ok but many in my party thought it was not tasty at all. The rooms were large and comfortable. I would have preferred a king bed over a room with 2 queens but that was strangely more expensive. The internet was blazing fast and the TV had a good selection of channels. My room was promptly cleaned every day with water and toiletries consistently being replaced. There really is n\u2019t anything I can complain about. I enjoyed my stay at Motif Seattle and would recommend it.

There is a bar and restaurant on the fifth floor. We had dinner there one night. I would say it is just okay. There are so many really great restaurants in Seattle that it really only makes sense to eat there if you just do not feel like going out. If you eat too much there is also a nice fitness room.
