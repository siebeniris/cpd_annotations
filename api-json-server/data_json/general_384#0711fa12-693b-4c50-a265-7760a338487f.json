We spent 5 nights mid June in this lovely hotel which lived up to the standards of the Acor brand. Having been very spoilt at the very plush Sofitel Nusa Dua during the earlier part of our Bali getaway we were delighted that the warmth of service flowed through at Pullman Legian. Location wise it is great away from the hustle bustle of Kuta yet walking distance to the interesting shops eateries lining all the way to Seminyak. We enjoyed the hotels themed buffets with live music especially the Curry Indonesian nights. Also the complimentary Sunrise Yoga sessions by the infinity pool are a real treat.", "offset": [314, 462], "date": "2015-07-07 00:00:00", "cpt": "0", "category": "general"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "ad8052aa-7995-49b0-89d0-c89548567672", "sentence": "Great place at Legian. As a AcorPlus Silver member I felt well taken care of at this hotel. it is my 1st visit after a 12 years gap to Bali. and I must say Pullman is a great resort. But I will list in good and bad so it is you can decide if you like to stay at Pullman Legian Nirwana. Good 1 Upscale and trendy resort quality in most aspect of hotel from check in to check out friendly staff good security etc2 Location is superb just steps to Legian beach across the road3. WIFI connectivity throughout hotel is superb 4. Room amenities is superb and sleep quality is very very god5. Spacious rooms mine was upgraded to suite from deluxe which was also great6. Good quality washroom kits Shick brand razor nice sewing kit great shampoo conditioner etc 7. Good eco friendly operation drinking water provided in reusable glass botles8. Calls to hotel operation answered quickly and profesionaly9. Housekeeping is swift and efficient. Very very good 10. Good breakfast spread and great quality stuff. Overall very nice Bad 1 My room 134. tap once turned to hot can not turn back to cold. Have to wait for long time till it resume normal function. Lucky my suite had 2 bathrooms. So I just use the other one. Perhaps a valve issue. Staff mentioned its a rare issue. Ye. it is a 1st time time for me to2. The living room coffee table corners have slight abrasive edge. careful when you move about scratched and slightly bloodied my knee during checking out rush. hey it is my carelessness. But just be mindful. can happened to anyone. 3. Wood flooring was sticky and greasy. Felt uncomfortable to walk on without foot wear perhaps last room occupant had foot massage and all that oil lotion transferred to the whole floor. My daughters deluxe room was ok though4. The heavy wooden door slams with a HUGE BANG. please close carefully. Will disturb neighbors units and vice versa if not use carefully. The door spring mechanism is just that powerful 5View of pool blocked by the lush greenery. so pool view is not a given and depends on which room you are in. Not a big issue though. 6. For non smokers the breakfast dining is a concern. The area close to the lobby lounge is only shielded by a decorative screen. Smoke traveled over to the dining area. This is totally unacceptable for a family oriented upscale resort. Smokers should be confined to smoking areas elsewhere. Will I stay at Pullman in my future Bali trip. Possibly Will I recommend anyone to stay at Pullman. Possibly too just be mindful of my observation above. it is a great hotel. beyond the bad points.", "offset": [92, 140], "date": "2015-12-17 00:00:00", "cpt": "0", "category": "general"}, {"id": 2, "uid": "cf41e450-a0e8-48c3-a078-20903ea76c74", "sentence": "Friendly clean centrally located Hotel.

Visited recently for 5 nights with a friend who had not stayed at this hotel before. My friend was impressed with the cleanliness of the room pools gardens and hotel overall. We arrived to room to find a lovely welcome note and a bowl of fresh fruit. I found the hotel staff lovely and friendly as usual nothing was a problem. Food was great I only ate at the Pullman and did not get ill. We stayed in Building 1 level 3 over looking garden pool. Every day the room was restocked with 4 glass bottles of drinkable water which was great. However there is a new small shop beside reception that sells water snacks cool drink etc if you need it. This is a very handy addition. It appears security is a priority here with regular checks and guards at the entrance. This combined with the layout of the hotel kind of circular with all rooms looking into central gardens and pool makes one feel quite safe and secure. My only suggestion would be could the music play a little later at the Infinity Pool in the evenings. ie till 7 pm not 6 Traffic into and around Kuta does seem to have increased since my last visit and there have been some road changes so just keep that in mind if your visiting places. Special mention to Dodi waitresses Wila and Indra Nopi at the day spa and the guest experience loyalty manager Alfian Alfy. Thanks again for a wonderful relaxing stay my 4th stay at the Pullman.

We recently spent 10 nights at The Pullman with our 3 kids and overall had a great stay. The hotel is large with manicured gardens that give it a tropical feel but not necessarily a Balinese one. The feel is very nuetral and maybe not what you may want from your Bali holiday. It is however quiet and provides a haven from the outside street noise. The rooms are spacious and clean and although the bed was a super king it had no pillow top and the matres was hard and not good at all for a restful sleep. The buffet breakfast was as good as any I had seen with plenty of choice and great tasting. It was the same for the nightly buffets. There is an infinity pool on the roof which ideally should have been built larger and it is popularity means getting a recliner is difficult during the afternoon. Much easier by the garden pool which was alot quieter. We stayed on a Scopon deal which included 50 off all drinks. This made it a little easier to order drinks inside the hotel which were priced on the high side even before the additional 21 tax was added. I do not understand why hotels outprice themselves like this. It is no surprise they no longer stock the minibar in the rooms the hotel has its own minimart on site. The Scopon deal made this hotel good value with all the inclusions. Without them i would suggest to carefully compare with other surrounding properties around the same nightly rate. If you find you like the asthetics of The Pullman then you will be happy here. All in all though it is a very nice hotel opposite Legian beach and within walking distance to the market shopping of Kuta and not far from the eateries of Seminyak.

It was very hot and I asked for the fan to be turned on and the staff informed me the fan is broken. I had to ask for the menu twice after sitting down before being given a menu. After ordering I was kept waiting nearly an hour and no sign of food or any updates from the staff. I had to ask several times about the food and was ignored. Finally when I said that I would need to leave if the food did n\u2019t arrive I was told that it would take another 5 10 min. When the food arrived it appeared to have been prepared hastily.

Tuesday 16th July we woke up to a 57 earthquake and went out of room as fast as possible after realising that it was an earthquake. We meet a few hotel staff in the corridor and asked then what to do they seemed no really be clear on the procedure and told we could go down or stay in the room up to us. We went down to the assembly point where some guest was on the lawn no hotel staff in sight. After 5 10 minutes without any staff giving any instructions we went back to the room. After this incident I started to study the signs of where was emergency exits etc. and to my surprise there was no hotel emergency exit map on the inside of the hotel door not any emegerncy exit sign in sight when you exit room 1348 and EXIT sign have same aperance as LIFT signs. All in all very much below the standard I expect from a top brand of an international hotel chain. Especially in an area where earthquakes happens from time to time and tsunami risk is present.

Check in was really smooth. we did arrive early so had to wait a couple of hours for the room to be ready however that is no fault of anybodys. We were directed to a waiting area that was airconditioned with access to computers TV and room service orders. We were kindly upgraded from a garden suite to a beachfront suite and the first thing we noticed was the actual size of these rooms. Very spacious newly refurbished helped and the food was great. The only thing I would say is that access too and from the beach was a little restricted and kind of affected the experience somewhat only accessible via the same road that motorised transport arrives and departs. I understand the restrictions here. Being a surfer as well only access via the lobby made it a little uncomfortable walking in and out with wet sandy feet.
