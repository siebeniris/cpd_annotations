I stayed at this property for four nights with my wife on an annual vacation to NoCal wine country. It is our fifth stay at this property and our experience spans the recently completed renovation of all guest rooms. Vintage Inn is located just to the northern end of Yountvile adjacent to the French Laundry gardens and the St Helena highway. The hotel grounds are self enclosed gardens in and of themselves and lend the property a secluded and quiet feel. Downtown Yountvile is a quiet and delightfully smaller version of local wine country towns mostly focusing on restaurants rather than shopping. TripAdvisor folks will know that there are multiple excellent eateries in town with two of them TFL and Bouchon owning Michelin stars and TFL long considered one of the finest in the nation. While the old version of the Vintage Inn was completely fine the renovation has tastefully upgraded the comfortable french country vibe with upgrades to furniture fixtures and most importantly the bathrooms. Within that category there are differing bathroom layouts some have jacuzi tubs with a integrated shower that is a little awkward to use others have a very large dual use shower setup that is to my mind superior. All rooms as well as the common area are very well appointed impeccably clean and quiet. Parking is directly behind the hotel and accessible via a short walk through the grounds. Food offerings are worth discussing in detail as each morning Vintage offers a large buffet brunch that includes a mimosa bar an omelette station and on the weekends a waffle station as well. The food is of very high quality and there are multiple hot and cold choices on offer including fresh fruit bread muffins pastries and cheeses. The buffet is included in the rate and thus provides excellent value especially as a base meal from which you can attack the wineries up and down the valley. There is an afternoon tea in the main lobby if you are so disposed with more pastries and small sandwiches that is also included in your rate. I have always found service at Vintage to be at the superior level. From reservations to room needs to concierge service to housekeeping customer service is attentive friendly and willing. There also seems to be very little turnover in the core staff signaling a positive workplace with attention to detail our annual chats with Carlos at the omelette station for example are becoming a bit of a tradition. Check in is always friendly and breezy despite the fact that we are sometimes arriving very late at night after a cross country flight from IAD and subsequent drive up from SFO. One tiny complaint this year Vintage switched from in room Nespreso machines to in room Keurig machines. While this is clearly a matter of taste I preferred the coffee made by the former and despise the coffee made by the latter. Feel free to attach firstworldproblems to this whine and if it matters to you Bouchon Bakery makes excellent coffee less than a block down the street. I unreservedly recommend this hotel to all travelers heading to wine country. Given the quality of the rooms food and service I had even call this a bargain despite NY SF DC level pricing especially when you factor in the included breakfast brunch. We have yet to experience anything other than a delightful experience at this property and look forward to our next visit in December 2016.", "offset": [1780, 1937], "date": "2015-12-16", "cpt": "0", "category": "price"}, {"id": 6, "uid": "6174acbb-a4a7-477a-8ca4-2085972ab8b0", "sentence": "Wine Country Perfection Location Service and Breakfast.

The 25 Resort Fee is included in the latter amount but note the absence of the sign on that number whereas the rate amount does have a sign a combination which sort of hides it. In addition the entire fee is bundled in with tax amounts which in California are notoriously high. All in all it looks like an intentional effort to hide or disguise this tack on amount.

To that my response is \u2013 if all of those are \u201c free \u201d do n\u2019t charge separately and additionally for them.
