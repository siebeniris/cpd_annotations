Due to misconection of my late evening flight Lufthansa booked me an overnight stay at this Sheraton conveniently located just across the termin building. The hotel is easy to find and it took me 3 \u00b4 to get there using the overhead path. The check in was very busy and as a SPG guest I checked in the lounge of the 9th floor. The lady there named Iskra was very helful and professional and got me into a very nice room on the 5th floor. The room in a contemporary decor was recently renovated it was beautiful modern ofa decent size and I liked it a lot. The bed was excellent the a c worked fine the decor was the TV was good with wide selection of international and local channels. Two bottles of comlimentary water were on display and were great to make an expreso from the machine. Regarding the noise have not heard anything from outside but the early morning slamming doors and loud talking from housekepingThe barthrom was not so good it seems the right part with a tub was recently updated but the main side with wash basing was basic and dull the same design as in other regular 3 star US hotels Mariot or Hilton. The lighting was also not good at all neon lights in front of the mirror. Some direct lights would be appreciated. The towels were not crispy white and were of poor quality. The amenities were not as one would expect from high end hotel. Dental and shaving kit could be ordered apartI had a dinner in the Flavours restaurant at 230 on Saturday night. When I entered the maitre just rolled her eyes when I told her I would be using the voucher from the airline and she was not happy when I wanted to seat at the table different than the one she assigned to me. The restaurant itsefl was beautiful with show cooking and the ambience was pleasant. The quality of food was not satisfactory. I ordered diet coke and got a glass full of ice for 7 \u20ac the plate of salmon with vegetables was tastles 21 \u20ac and finally the tiny small side dish of grilled potatoes with rosemary were raw35\u20acThe waiters there were not helpful at all and every time I ordered or asked something they would be bothered and it seemed they were doing me a favour being able to eat there. When I left the staff made desrespective comments and felt really unconfortable. They also made inapropiate jokes which really annoyed me. Once back in my room I tried to reach customer relations but they only answered after 5th attempt. I was told again that breakfast for Lufthansa customers was until 9amThis must be the only hotel in the world that serves breakfast until that early and on Sundays. My surprise was even bigger when I could have a nice breakfast at 1040 the next morning. Every time I interacted with a member of staff they would say. oh from Lufthansa as if we were tagged with different level If you stay in suite then you are addressed by name if you are from airline crew you get a little extra but if you stay on behalf of a third party then you get the minimum of minimum. I am sure Lufthansa pays a lot of money for its passengers who need to stay at this hotel on involuntary basis and I would expect the same attention for all. As far as I know the hotel does not give anything for freIt is a pity that each guest is treated differently and they showed me that I am Lufthansa passenger who on this occasion does not pay for anything. I am SPG member and have stayed many times in Starwod properties all around the world. Some hotels were excellent others not so good but have never had a feeling that I was not welcomed at all. Final verdict. This is decent large and beautiful airport hotel but would never stay here again not even for free. If I am offered a hotel in FRA due to irregularity again I would insist to book me into nearby Hilton or Garden Inn which I hear are wonderful.", "offset": [3577, 3676], "date": "2016-06-26", "cpt": "0", "category": "general"}, {"id": 10, "uid": "1d5a8582-a485-4882-815c-85ba6a63ac7d", "sentence": "Layover.

After two weeks at a mathematics institute in the beautiful Black Forest in Germany we decided to spend the night close to the Frankfurt airport because we were flying back to the United States at noon at the following day. This hotel is very large with a long walk from the lobby to the elevators. We had read about this and my husband has some mobility challenges he can walk a short distance but needs a wheelchair or time and a walker for longer ones. so we asked for a room next to the elevators. We got one and fortunately it was quiet. However the room had other problems. The toilet was very low to the floor and the flush button was recessed and very difficult to manage perhaps for ETs long finger but not for ours. My husband uses a CPAP breathing device but there was no outlet close to the bed. I unplugged a floor lamp moved an ottoman close to the bed balanced the CPAP and was able to stretch the cord from the machine to that socket. The hotel provided a binder of removable information packets but the menus from hotel restaurants were so torn worn and overwritten that we could not make out the prices. The telephone button for guest services did not work so I went downstairs to talk with them directly. I requested new menus it was 3 pm so plenty of time until dinner an extension cord and I mentioned the problems we were having in the room. They expressed sympathy and promised to send someone upstairs to check on the telephone and also provide new menus. No one ever came. I walked to the terminal a few city blocks away through a series of tunnels and bought take out for dinner. Around 930 we set up for bed only to find that the outlet I was using for the CPAP also controlled the hall and bathroom lights which had to remain on all night. I again went downstairs to guest services which expressed sympathy. offered me a free drink in the bar for my trouble but did not solve the problems. At that time I made sure that a wheelchair had been ordered to bring us down to the lobby in time for meeting the Lufthansa wheelchair I had ordered the day before which was going to take us over the the terminal. The last problem we had was the next day when the hotel wheelchair did not arrive on time despite 3 phone calls from me to the downstairs manager. Someone from the lobby staff not a wheelchair driver because he had some problems operating it arrived in the room about 10 minutes late the next morning said the hotels wheelchair service did not show up and we met the Lufthansa group. A few positives. the room was clean the beds comfortable. The lights and TV worked. It was quiet. When we checked in we were offered breakfast at 25 euros per person which is expensive although cheaper than buying it directly at the restaurant that morning but I decided that a slow comfortable breakfast was worth it. And it turned out that we saved on dinner the night before by buying at the terminal since the menus never arrived. The breakfast was exceptional well serviced and a generous delicious buffet. Very worthwhile for a traveler before a long flight. Quiet full of fresh fruits omelettes to order meats other good fare. We recommend this option. When we returned to the US I checked my Sheraton bill and discovered that someone had charged Red Bull drinks from the minibar to our credit card. We never even opened the minibar to peek I advise economy minded travelers to buy beer in cans at the airport as we did. After some correspondence with the Sheraton they removed or at least promised to remove still no sign of it. the additional charge. The hotel representatives who corresponded with us were very congenial and apologetic which was nice to deal with. But I do caution other Sheraton customers to check their bills carefully and apparently watch their identities credit.
