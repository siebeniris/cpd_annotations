If you are looking for a random overnight in a place of luxury stay here. If you are traveling to wine country and wish to feel immersed in beauty and old world charm STAY HERE. The Kenwod is beyond a 5 star rating system it is difficult to capture the level of comfort and beauty you will experience. I was at the Kenwod for 2 nights 3 days this past weekend. The grounds are immaculate and gorgeous. The rooms are spectacular. The staff is at your service. There was not one request that was not immediately accommodated even down to asking for a copy of the romantic CD that one finds in their room. The bedding is deluxe the furnishings are stately and the bathrooms are spa like. My only regret is that my husband was not with me. Friendly and professional service was given in the fireplace charmed wine bar. The center courtyard is enveloped by beautiful climbing vegetation towering palm and fruit trees. I lived in Europe for a number of years and I could not help but feel that the Kenwod courtyard took me back. On a walk through the property I was admiring a fruit tree and a staff member encouraged me to actually pick a pomegranate or an orange or a lime. whatever you like. In fact the gentleman offered to get it for me. Later I enjoyed a pom with some champagne. Beautiful. While relaxing around the heated pool and spa of which there are two I was served drinks as I lounged about enjoying the warm sun. I was NEVER disturbed but I was taken care of and when I needed something someone was immediately there. The Kenwod proves that you do not have to have a crown to be treated like royalty. The cleaning service was fabulous and my room was spotless. Not one streak on my glass shower not one. The carpets were clean. The floors dustles. Turn down service was quiet quick and seamless. I enjoyed the mouth watering salted chocolates that were left on my pilow Breakfast was delicious. Maybe a bit more direction could be provided to the guests as they walk into the breakfast room on their first morning but this is not a dig just an observation. it is not all together too hard to figure out where the coffee is but just the same a morning greeting or seating hostess when I first arrived would have been welcomed. By the second morning I was familiar with the routine of course Room service was wonderful. My service required one person and two people showed up. They were quick attentive and did everything I asked. I would encourage management to explore whether a slightly larger menu is a possibility but what was available was delicious. Loved it. Throughout my stay there was never not an opportunity to pick up some fruit a wine a bag of chips biscoti a Luna Bar etc. There was always something available to include a water and tea bar. I also saw in passing what appeared to be an espresso bar next to the wine bar but I did not stop for one. I have no doubt that had I asked for a latte or cappuccino one would have been brought to me immediately. Listen here is the bottom line. Stay here. To my shock I saw 2 reviews that contained complaints. One wanted free champagne all day as she brought in cheese and crackers from the car. The other review spent more time writing about her level of education and status and therefore she should be treated as such. Heres the thing. The Kenwod did not get it is good name serving crackers from Target and there is a difference between rich and wealthy people rich people think they deserve it and wealthy people pay to expect it. I have written my review from a real person perspective and truly ignore the riff raf. The Kenwod Inn is a gem. Since I am not wealthy have 23 kids and live in a far off state I will not be able to return too soon. But should I ever be able to the Kenwod will be my first stop. Hopefully next time will be with my husband. What a dream that would be. What a beauty this place. Wonderful job and pats on the back to all the people that work there and make it happen. Management take note. Your people are stellar and they deserve some fine acknowledgment. They are making this place happen for the owners and they deserve the credit.

We just returned from our trip to Sonoma on Monday Dec 14th and we were so sad to go. I honestly can not say enough good things about the Kenwod Inn Spa. This was our first time at the Inn and our expectations were not only met but exceeded. The staff was helpful throughout our time there providing wonderful recommendations free wine tasting cards for pretty much everywhere we went directions dinner reservations and so much more. Not only was the service great but the accommodations were as well. I loved our room and the fireplace topped it off. We were completely relaxed and comfortable which has been hard for me lately since I am pregnant. The Inn itself was gorgeous and secluded. We ate the complimentary breakfast every morning which was delightful. My husband loved the eggs Benedict and I had the Ricotta pancakes every day. It was hard to believe that the breakfast was included but we are sure happy it was. Marcia was our server every morning and she was wonderful. We had a couples massage on our last day. We were greeted with Proseco dry lavender soda for me since I am pregnant and then led to the fireplace to enjoy our drinks. The massage that followed was perfect. When we go back to Sonoma we will certainly stay at the Kenwod Inn again. We loved everything about it and this was the perfect time of year to go. The rooms were very reasonably priced and the vineyards were not as busy. we have been in July. and it was beautiful but too busy for our liking. I hope this review is helpful.

On the first day I called to request turndown service for all three nights at the same time. It happened on the first night but not on the second. I had to call to request it again. I also called at 930pm to request a mini refrigerator for our room. No one answered. I left a message. No one ever responded or called back. I had to call again the next day to request again. compared to our previous stay the breakfast was disappointing. Each morning the food was running low. I had to ask them to bring more fruit or scones out. The staff eventually did but seemed annoyed by my asking. They did n\u2019t proactively refill the food. Each day I had to ask for place settings because they did n\u2019t already have them out. Aside from the quantity of food available the inn used to provide plated hot entrees each day which were delicious. We missed that. we stayed in a room by the main pool on the ground floor. Each time the guests walked around in the room above us we could hear them moving around. Not a huge deal except that they went to the restroom regularly through the night and would wake my wife up. All in all we felt that the hotel was not well staffed to support the number of guests at the price point being charged. The attention to detail in the service category really lacked eg the ice in our bucket had melted and our cava was still in there but the turndown service did n\u2019t bother to refill with fresh ice.

Does the sun and beautiful surroundings cloud one \u2019s judgementThe property is visually a delightful on arrival and the front desk staff friendly. Being a small establishment check in was instant and we were directed to our large room. The Mediterranean rustic theme pervades throughout but perhaps this masks areas that could benefit from a little TLC notably the breakfast room. The gardens are a pleasure the pool large and well heated nice clean furniture to relax on. A popular area for \u201c girly groups \u201d but no issue at all whilst we were there. We have stayed in bed and breakfasts from east to west coast with many offering a complimentary hour of wine and canap\u00e9s. Here this is in the wine room but given by one of the local wineries so just a very small measure of a couple of their wines some excellent. The cheese and crackers are provided by the inn but much the same each evening. The Kenwod is close to many of these wine estates so it is easy and convenient to visit them. There are tickets in the lobby offering 2 for1 tastings at many. The breakfast was good but not exceptional. The granola tasty a large plate of cut fruit which was not overly inspiring a large warming pan of a hot item and muffins. This was all a serve yourself buffet with fruit juice and coffee. It would be so nice if coffee was poured at the table by staff. Now for the bedroom. What I did not like was the paper cups by the coffee machine in the room. Each day pods for 4 drinks were left but only three paper cups so one had to be washed. Never in a 45star hotel have I ever had paper cups. Perhaps there is an issue that china ones might be dropped on the tiled floors but at the price of these rooms there should better. The bed was extremely comfortable and the bedding good quality. Plenty of towels in the bathroom and L\u2019Ocitane toiletries. It is good to see that the inn is trying to reduce plastic waste from small bottles of shampoos etc with larger refilable units. One cooler evening the gas fire in the room was a very welcome addition making it cosy and inviting. Everything was spotlessly clean the housekeeping first rate. It is a great shame that there is not a small bar open in the evening offering some quality light food even if only small rather than room service pizza or the like as this would really enhance the ambience of this lovely old inn.
