So as stated this was a surprise to me so i did not get the opportunity to research in advance like I normally do. The resort is visually stunning. we pulled up about 1 am from a delayed flight and it was gorgeous. since I did nt know about private cottages we pulled everything out to check in. No point in doing that each room is a private cottage spread out acros the property. we were escorted to our cottage and it was private and cozy. My only complaint is it was not spotless kind of a bummer and the only reason they do not get 5 stars. Service was with out flaw. An itinerary was pre planned and booked by my husbands request for wine tours and maps with timing was all layed out. Dinner at the farm was good service was a bit off my huband had still and i had sparkling water they kept mixing up what water was in what glass kind of obnoxious considering you wasted my bottle which then kept getting tossed. The bonfly is great very small only fits 48 people. Breakfast is great hubby said best pancakes he has ever eaten not sure if i should be insulted. because its small Weekends are impossible for breakfast as its also a locals place. We also ended up having dinner there and it was great service and food consistently on point. You can borrow bikes at the front desk and take them for a few hours and visit close by winerys or just a little excersize. the hill top pool is quiet and overlooks vineyards. Over all a fantastic experience. Quick tip they say the pool is 24 hours however we went to the hot tub about 9 pm and it was super dark which was not a problem but we could not find a towel.

Read this before you book. Planned a weekend at Napa for my 40s birthday. We chose Carneros for the first time. I will make it short just so people can read it easily. Pros. The staff at the restaurants including the pool restaurant are really great striving to provide great service. Great food at the restaurants. Cons. 1 Had two reservations called 3 days before arrival to make sure they combined both. They confirmed over the phone. They did not. 2 Arrived late and tired just to hear So you guys are moving cottages. After mentioning this was a bad mistake on their side front desk guy without apologizing and with an attitude which is a cultural trademark for them as I came to understand later did combine the reservation. Also 3 days before arrival I used their website concierge service where they let you choose and buy items to be in the room by the arrival like wine and chocolate. Nothing was in the room and front desk had not any information regarding my choices on their website. 3 Changed my card on the front desk during the check in they charged 200 deposit in the new Amex card. 4. In the morning we were checking out we called early to make sure the card on file was the right one. It was not. They somehow managed to roll back to the old one So how did they charge 200 on the new one. Will I ever see this money again. I do not know the answer to these questions. 5 Safety I was almost hit by one of their trucks all the time being driven through the small streets of the property. The guy saw me on the back and turned in my direction anyway missing by inches. I got scared he laughed and shouted I got this. No apologies. Wonder if it was a kid that they got scared and moved. See picture for the size of the truck. For reference resort streets are good for one SUV at a time6 Air conditioning at the Cottage failing. Had to call maintenance twice the cottage was at 86 degrees. 7 Room service always leaving dirty things behind as you can see by the pictures. One day they knocked on the door for the evening replenishment visit we asked them to come back 20 min later they never did. 8. The only place you can have lunch on the premises is at the Bonfly Cafe. it is a lovely restaurant but it has around 20 tables most of them seat two. Meaning 1 2 hours wait. Only other options are pool or convenience store snacks sandwiches. Food is good at those places but we were not in the mood for having a sub for lunch in Napa. 9 Outdoor furniture at the cottage private garden are dirty. As you can see by the pictures. 10 Pools are not spotless as you would expect in a resort of this caliber. At any given time you can spot dirty resting at the bottom. 11 Beds are too soft in a bad and old fashioned way. Our backs were busted from sleeping on it. 11 When checking out we called before hand to make sure the right card was on file I wanted my Amex points to count. like I said before it mysteriously was not. I asked how was this even possible since the hotel charged a fee on my Amex when I switched it in person when we arrived at the front desk. The women on the front desk then went on to explain how they can not switch cards by phone. Again I explained the same thing again she went on to explain how they can not switch card via phone. it is like a twilight zone where you are speaking crystal clear English and they play dumb asking you to repeat or just faking they do not get it because of your accent. This story ends with the front desk lady disconnecting the phone on me. I guess. she got frustrated. Yes. We were many times forced to repeat ourselves over and over again on the most basic things to the front desk people while they made strange faces like as if they are making an effort. even though me and my wife speak crispy clear English we live in SF she works at Apple in Cupertino and I wrote 5 published books and founded 3 start ups related to education. So English communication is definitely not an issue on our side. The same did not happen at the restaurants. I guess our Brazilian accent is too different for the front desk people to handle but not that different for the ever helpful restaurant crew. To summarize the hotel needs to completely renovate its Cottages including furniture and painting. And they also really need to properly train and teach their employees on topics like respect and diversity. Not coming back not worth the money and stress. If after reading this you still wana to give them a try take this check list with you. Things that happened with us were not bad luck or random they were systematically taking place so I am sure you will be able to check plenty of those items too.", "offset": [4184, 4282], "date": "2017-07-18", "cpt": "1", "category": "room"}, {"id": 13, "uid": "6dd5a523-e7f3-4a3a-ab5b-bde814163014", "sentence": "Beautiful stay great service.

My husband and I were guests at Carneros Resort and Spa this past weekend. I have high expectations for a 950 a night room. I was debating between Carneros Resort and Hotel Yountvile and we chose Carneros. I will break it down as best as possible. The Resort ambiance was beautiful. Very romantic Hampton like feel. beautiful landscape filled with many different fruit trees and olive trees rustic farm feel clean grounds for the most part. As we walked through the main gates to get to the cottages we did notice a great deal of spider webs and spiders. I feel like those should be cleaned up. The Cottage Room Rooms were nice but for the price I was not completely impressed. No wow factors but was clean and had a fresh feeling. The chair in the room was worn out. It was not crazy hot but we noticed lots of flies in the room. There were also a few bugs on the ceiling not sure what can be done about that. I absolutely loved the heated porcelain tiles in the bathroom that was nice. The porch outside was super cute. The lotion shampoo and body wash were good quality orange and rosemary. The electric fireplace was great the first night but we tried to turn it on the second night and it did not work. Coffee in the room was good we had a stocked up fridge with coke 7up and waters which was nice. The outside area was no big deal. We did not use the outside shower and we tried turning on the outside heater but did not know how and did not want to ring in for help. Instructions might be helpful. We also found a steak bone outside the patio door YIKES. They need to do a better job cleaning the outside furniture and area before new guests check in. We did not check in until 5 pm so there should have been plenty of time to clean the room and outside. We did not feel like sitting outside for that reason. The 2nd night we did not get any cleaning service to our room until we called them around 2 in the afternoon even though our service light was on all morning. Maybe a complimentary bottle of wine would be a nice touch when you arrive in your room or something special. Adult pool area The weather was perfect so we decided to go up to the pool for a few hours. Yikes to a few things. The view was amazing one of the most beautiful pool views I have seen but I wish they would have taken care of the area better. Where do I begin. Service was awesome. All the servers were great but possibly some were beginners I do not know. We got there. were greatest very nicely but had to lay out our own towels. I could let that slide. Next pool temp when we got there on Thursday was nice and warm but on Friday was cold so I do not go in the pool. We sat and ordered from our server. We ordered a bottle of rose after a few minutes the server came back and said he was out of the bottle so we got a different bottle. Also I over heard him talking to 2 other couples and both of their drink orders had similar situations they were all out. It was a Friday they should have been stocked up for the weekend right. He brought it out after a few minutes with plastic cocktail glasses. Maybe i m a snob. ur i can not drink wine in a plastic cocktail glass. I know it has to be plastic because we are by the pool but please serve it in an acrylic wine glass. I told the server I needed a wine glass and he said they were all out. I told him to please look for some. He never came back and my wine was out in the sun for a good 15 min until I waved down another server. She said they could not get me one and then I told her o do not want the bottle unles I can get a wine glass so she brought out 2 glass ones. Next the jacuzi was horrible. For the beauty of the property please do something about the jacuzi. It was yellow and all the plaster was discolored and chipping. Even my husband noticed and he never complains. The spa was nice I used the steam room which was nice but I would love to see a unisex one so my husband and I could have enjoyed the steam room together. The market had great salads snacks coffee wines by bottle. Farm had amazing dinerBon fly amazing breakfast and great bloody Mary but busy for brunch on a Saturday. I was bummed that we could not get late check out on Saturday so we ended up leaving the resort at 12 and had to lug our luggage around. Transportation we used Uber most of the time did not have any trouble getting an Uber. I will say that this Resort is about 15 20 min away from yountvile. Next time i would probably stay in yountvile. Overall service was good. Everyone was friendly had a smile on their face and was very helpful. Concierge. Thomas was awesome thank you for all your help. Cleaning service needs some work and pool service needs help. Overall we really enjoyed our time at Carneros but realistically for what we paid I expected a lot more. I do not think we will return to Carneros unles we get a great deal. We will visit the Restaurants though.", "offset": [113, 161], "date": "2018-10-22", "cpt": "1", "category": "room"}]}
