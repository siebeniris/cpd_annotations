This really is not a 5 star resort in comparison with others however in the Tampa area Palm Harbor 30 minutes northwest of Tampa. Inisbrok is a star. The grounds are beautifully maintained and the golf courses are great. My grandma is in a nursing home close by so this is a regular go to place for the family. The Lochnes pool is beautiful and fun for the kids. There are bike walking trails and the tennis facility is nice too. The whole resort is family friendly with plenty to do. This trip was a couples trip and it was perfect even though the renowned Copperhead course was out of commission until October. There are three other courses that are definitely great options Island North and South. Island course is a must. There are older style buildings scattered around the resort named after the various famous golf courses around the world. We stayed in Baltusrol in a King Executive Suite which had been updated and had plenty of room. There is also an accordion folding divider that can be used to separate the bedroom area from the sitting area that also has a fold out sofa bed. The summer is their slow season so you get plenty of attention from the staff. Although there is plenty to do at the resort to the north is the Tarpon Springs Sponge dock area that is worth the short drive eat at Rusty Bellies a great restaurant on the water and a short drive to the south are some cute beach shops. Drive out to the beach and for dinner try the Thirsty Marlin restaurantfried grouper sandwich is awesome.", "offset": [965, 1110], "date": "2015-07-28", "cpt": "0", "category": "general"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "e3795e0e-7ab0-4551-9b2b-5fe9f4d3bd87", "sentence": "Typical Faux Resort Bait and Switch. Of course the website makes the place look wonderful but that is about it. My family arrived late on a Thursday night. The registration area was really nice and the person checking us in was friendly efficient and answered every question completely and easily. I was really excited about staying here. I started getting the sinking feeling when we walked into the building that contained our one bedroom suite. We were of course on the second floor which would not have been so bad except we had a CR V stuffed to max load with enough stuff for my wife two year old daughter and me. Again would not have been a problem except there are no elevators. The building is basically a 1970s sports dorm full of smelly dirty 1 bedroom apartmentsdo not worry about having cash on hand to tip anyone as after check in you are basically on your own to come to grips with the mistake you just made by booking a stay here. While I was acting as Sherpa for all our gear my poor wife had to hand mop the floors with Lysol wipes we had packed as the tile floors were absolutely filthy in the bathroom and kitchen. Thankfully the carpet is quite dark and whatever is going on there we are fortunate not to see it. Though sitting on the couch I can see some previous residents leftovers under the entertainment center shiver. The next thing that greeted us upon entry was wafting waves of stink. It smelled like the climate control had been set for 85 for at least six months. No one had preped the apartment. After a restless night of wondering if we should just pack up and drive the two hours back home we went to the Loch ness pool. The staff was friendly again and the pool was really neat. With a zero entry section and a man made mini beach in front of that the majority of the pool being 1 3 feet our daughter had a wonderful time there. The pool while fun is in desperate need of draining pressure washing and repainting. It actually needed this 5 years ago. The volleyball net haphazardly thrown across one section of the pool was more useful as a fishing net at that point. It appeared to have been broken long ago by rowdy kids and never replaced. It would be more prudent to just remove it. We returned from the pool to be greeted by a couple flying roaches. Upon terminating said roaches we again debated calling and asking for a different room. We decided not to as we had cleaned the room well ourselves and did not want to haul everything back down only to have to haul it to a second floor unit somewhere else. We will if we have a crepshow roach moment. it is probably on YouTube if you do not get that reference do not look it up if you do not like scary gross stuff. Also do not stay here for sure if that is the case. While my wife and daughter napped I headed out to Publix to get more food for our stay as room service the night before had run almost 60 for a grilled cheese sandwich chicken tenders sweet potato fries a pulled pork platter and two 8 oz cartons of milk. Now that I saw the place in the daytime I realized that the entire building style is the same throughout. I thought we had been stuck in the bad section as punishment for arriving so late. It reaffirmed my decision not to complain. Upon returning with the groceries I was stuck for about 10 minutes a few cars deep in line at the guard gate waiting to be allowed to drive to our sad apartment. Normally this would be ok except for the melting 10 lb bag of ice 2 boxes of outshine frozen bars and other freezer items I was overcharged for due to it being a tourist area. I am writing this on the second night of our scheduled 4 night stay. I can not tell you if we are going to stick out the next two nights. We really miss creature comforts such as ceiling fans ventilation throughout the place we live a bathtub at least garden tub size an ice maker and water dispenser in the fridge. fast wi fi they have wifi but it is slow pest control and blinds that actually fully close. I can not recommend staying here. In sharp infuriating contrast the grounds are beautiful the golf course looks immaculate and the staff is really great. A great laugh to be had here is the material in the rooms trying to get people to buy these nasty apartments as either a home or time share. They actually have the nerve to call this luxury. Run run far away from this nightmare with absolutely no quality control. No matter how good a deal you get on a stay here It Is Not Worth It. These are shoddily refurbished sports dorms that needed far more than a single coat of paint and the cheapest 27 32 LG LCD TVs they could get on bulk refurbish outlet sites. Given how gross the accommodations are my wife is reticent to try the spa facilities. I think we will hit the beach tomorrow and maybe the Florida aquarium Sunday. We will likely bail Sunday evening with a tropical system on its way in there is no telling what manner of creature will be driven in during the monsoon conditions.", "offset": [4739, 4816], "date": "2015-08-28", "cpt": "0", "category": "general"}, {"id": 2, "uid": "1424dd3f-c247-4598-83e9-128aa86b8de3", "sentence": "Very comfortable place and great golf.

No notification of this prior to our arrival and of course no option to cancel and leave standing in the lobby. Martin then proceeded to say there were NO first floor rooms. I asked if there were other locations besides Belfast. No. but you have an updated room. No first floor rooms available in the entire resort. No. Drive around. The days we stayed there were never more than 10 cars in any parking lot. When you walk into the building to get to your room you are immediately overwhelmed with a damp musty smell. The room was dated the all metal cork screw broken. Cleaning service put a dirty plate back into the cupboard not once. not twice. but three times. Internet service in Belfast was TERRIBLE. Virtually unusable for Apple products. but you get a newspaper for your 20 a day resort fee. You can rent a bike to ride the property for 19 an hour. Packards Steakhouse is very overpriced but decent. We tried to eat at the Market Salamander Grill but unfortunately it had rained two hours earlier and apparently none of the staff was capable of drying off any of the outdoor tables so we left and went to Ozona Blue instead. The only two bright spots Michele in the Turnbery Pub and Daryl in the Copperhead Pro Shop. Amazingly friendly and professional. If you are looking for a golfing vacation we were not with the guys to get drunk you may not care if you pay 150 for a round of golf at one of the golf courses. If you are looking for a vacation with your spouse stay somewhere else. lest you show up and find the spa is closed.

When I booked this I had no idea the resort was very old you do not get that by looking at the website pics and the main goal is to cater to the men that golf there. Walking into the lobby it smells very musty which they try unsuccessfully try to cover with air freshener. The room I initially got looked nothing like the website. It was very musty smelling tons of stains on the carpet and chair with ripped and water stained wall paper. It was gross. They did give me a newly remodeled room when I complained. That room was nicer but the hallways still smelled old and musty. I booked this thinking it would be a family friendly resort with lots of things for kids to do but it is n\u2019t. Besides the Loch Ness pool that my son enjoyed there was nothing else really to do. The worst part of my stay was the uncomfortableness I felt at dinner all three nights I was there. My son and I typically ate around 730 in the main restaurant Salamander Grill. As this resort tailors to male golfers it was like eating dinner in a frat house. They were loud and obnoxious and the way they treated the women wait staff was disgusting. I had to explain to my 12 year old son at dinner that is not how you treat a woman. I mentioned this at checkout but they did n\u2019t seem to care. Speaking of checkout what a mess. I booked a package indicating it was prepaid in full in May but they still charged me the full amount less one night. After 30 minutes they finally corrected it and only charged incidentals. A few hours after getting home they charged the room in addition to incidentals. After talking to them again and checking my bank records back in May they did not charge the full amount as indicated on the email receipt but only one night. My mistake for not verifying on my bank statement when I purchased it. but I have prepaid many hotel packages before and when you get a receipt that says prepaid in full upon booking that is what I expected.

Courses were in good condition for middle of the summer and pace of play was outstanding. NO GPS or USB chargers in cart which is unacceptable for a resort that hosts a PGA tour event. Lunch at Copperhead and main clubhouse was decent with great service as well we had dinner at steakhouse one night and Ralph took great care of our group. Now onto the actual resort rooms.

They basically said the resort is full and offered me a room change the next day which I declined. Resort is huge and no joke some rooms had to be 5 10 minute drive between each other. They offer 24 hour shuttle but who wants to deal with that on a golf trip. Hotel buildings and rooms are tired and desperate need of updating.

My husband and I were really looking forward to our babymon staycation. I had heard so many great things read positive reviews and it was recommended by a co worker. Maybe my expectations were set too high. The short of the long is that in my opinion if golfing is not your thing this is not the resort for you. Their hospitality is very much lacking and things that seem like second nature at other hotels are an afterthought if a thought at all. Property is very much outdated and there is not a whole lot to do. For more specific details feel free to continue reading. From the moment we arrived we were met with a cold and unpleasant attitude. It took a good 30 to 45 seconds for us to even be acknowledged by the front desk staff after I said under my breath is anyone going to acknowledge us. Odd thing was that when another gentlemen of caucasian descent came in after us he was immediately and warmly greeted. My husband black and I hispanic immediately caught on to this without needing to say anything to one another. We were checked in and gave passes to explore the property since our room was not ready we arrived 30min early so that is fair. We were told we would get a call when our room was ready but when it had reached our check in time of 4 pm we had yet to receive a call. We walked back and arrived 5 past 4 and our room still was not ready. The front desk representative was neither helpful nor apologetic that our room was not ready. She responded only with we will call you when it is ready and it is only 5min past your check in time. There was no effort on her part to see what the issue was or to try to expedite the process. None of this said hospitality or warmness by any stretch of the imagination. Finally one of the other front desk reps who perhaps overhead decided to change our room when it got closer to 430pm and our original room still was not ready. We appreciated this a lot. We tried to move on and not let this ruin our stay and made the most of the rest of the time. The rooms were fine there was nothing really wrong with them but the property as a whole seemed to be a little outdated. We were on our way out the room the next morning when housekeeping came by and so they skipped us and we thought they were going to come back. They never did. If golfing is not your thing there is not a whole lot left to do. If you are a family there is a large playground and one of the pools has a slide and kidie area that is perfect for you but for couples that perhaps do not want to golf and want to do something other then hangout by the pools all day there are not a lot of options. There is mini golf basketball and shuffleboard. We were excited about these activities until we arrived. All three of these things were tiny outdated and not well kept. The basketball court looked like one at an old abandoned park mini golf was really rough around the edges with holes missing labels and lanes on top of one another. We played two rounds and made the most of it. On our last day on the property the cherry on top of our stay was being asked for identification at one of the pools shortly after we arrived. We were the only ones there and the security officer on duty said he received a call about that gates being locked even though he did not check all the gates upon arrival. The officer said but while I am here can I see your resort passes. We did not question him but again we both got a sinking feeling and wondered why our presence was questioned. Security to get onto the property is really tight and everyone inside had already presented proper documentation. I am not the type of person to make something about race but too many things happened even in addition to what I wrote here that left me wondering.

I visit Palm Harbor several times a year to see the family. This year we tried the Inisbrok resort for the first time. I wish I could give this hotel a better review because I wanted to like it and it has a lot of great features for families. But after having stayed here twice I would have to say that I am over it. The first time we visited in April 2018 for my sons 1st birthday and the last time we stayed here in May of 2018 over the Memorial Day weekend. The hotel had announced fireworks and all sorts of activities but the weather was pretty bad and most of this stuff did not happen we could not even use the pool or go for walks or utilize any of the outdoor recreational areas and facilities due to the weather. However there was no refund or reduction of the pretty hefty resort fee. This time we were booked in a one bedroom apartment the previous time we had booked a two bedroom suite. Both times we got a nicely furnished room but they could have been a lot cleaner. My son who just started walking around this time found a peanut and a fruit loop on the kitchen floor which I was lucky enough to catch before he swallowed it. The other time I found small pieces of broken glass on the carpet next to the kitchen and there was dust sitting everywhere almost as if nobody had stayed here in a long long time. Maid service was sporadic and sometimes we got a free newspaper and sometimes we did not. The staff by the pool was very pleasant while the front desk was a bit ignorant to say the least. I had called prior to our arrival to let them know we would be a late check in asking them to hold the room and to double check that they had reserved the crib that we had ordered.

I visit Palm Harbor several times a year to see the family. This year we tried the Inisbrok resort for the first time. I wish I could give this hotel a better review because I wanted to like it and it has a lot of great features for families. But after having stayed here twice I would have to say that I am over it. The first time we visited in April 2018 for my sons 1st birthday and the last time we stayed here in May of 2018 over the Memorial Day weekend. The hotel had announced fireworks and all sorts of activities but the weather was pretty bad and most of this stuff did not happen we could not even use the pool or go for walks or utilize any of the outdoor recreational areas and facilities due to the weather. However there was no refund or reduction of the pretty hefty resort fee. This time we were booked in a one bedroom apartment the previous time we had booked a two bedroom suite. Both times we got a nicely furnished room but they could have been a lot cleaner. My son who just started walking around this time found a peanut and a fruit loop on the kitchen floor which I was lucky enough to catch before he swallowed it. The other time I found small pieces of broken glass on the carpet next to the kitchen and there was dust sitting everywhere almost as if nobody had stayed here in a long long time. Maid service was sporadic and sometimes we got a free newspaper and sometimes we did not. The staff by the pool was very pleasant while the front desk was a bit ignorant to say the least. I had called prior to our arrival to let them know we would be a late check in asking them to hold the room and to double check that they had reserved the crib that we had ordered. Upon check in they were still not able to confirm if the room in fact had the crib. We would find out once we get to the room and to give them a call if the pack n play was not there she said.

When we got there the room next to us was being painted and we asked to move due to the paint smell. They refused to move us stating their manager said no to any moves this weekend. We had to stay out of the room the entire time until it got cool enough to open the windows to vent the paint smell out of our room.
