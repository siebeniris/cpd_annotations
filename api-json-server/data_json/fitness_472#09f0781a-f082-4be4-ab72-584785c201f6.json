Had a great stay at the W Staff was very nice from the check in to help with activities a man with cool green socks was so helpful when they were SO busy to seeing staff in the elevator everyone gives you a cheery hello to the young man that got our cab at 60 am. Loved the pool perfect temp so nice lounge chairs nice free water and yummy green apples. Ate lunch at the pool everyday having the yummy Greek salad. The rooms have super comfy beds I did not want to get out of bed in the am. It was also the quietest hotel I have ever stayed in. Nice balcony. The only thing I was not crazy about was the bathroom. Needs more light or a lighted makeup mirror. The glass shower wall is a little odd but we did get used to it. The bathroom could use a door. Everyone needs a little privacy now and then.

My girlfriend and I decided on the W and were very happy we did. Typically staying at Mariot or Hilton properties this was our first W experience. The modern contemporary architecture and decor was exactly what we were looking for to get away for a long weekend. The hotel lobby sits beneath yes beneath the hotel pool. The hotel pool deck has direct access through a staircase inside the pool into the lobby. Very interesting design. The rooms were spacious and clean. The bathroom had a rather open feel to it with a giant window into the rest of the room. Not ideal for privacy. The location of the hotel was central and very close to Las Olas. The concierge was very helpful in activity and restaurant selections. The view overlooking the ocean front property was amazing especially in the evening. They light fires in the evening on the balconies which creates a fantastic environment for the cooler nights. There was always music playing from the elevators to pool deck.

We do not take a trip to Florida we take a vacation at the W Hotel Fort Lauderdale. This hotel and the staff just happen to be in Florida. We have made this our march destination our choice because it feels like home and a family we get to see once or twice a year. The staff are what make this hotel great. From the director of guest services through to the wet deck staff wet deck servers wheels valet and room dressers the staff as much as the perfect location and hotel pol spa amenities. They make the W Fort Lauderdale the best resort. The new room decor and pool deck are amazing but we had like to see the old cabanas back if they rework the Wet deck. The rooms are very well appointed and very very comfortable. The new colours and furnishing make the time you spend in your room perfect and you do not want to leave the room. We dinned with friends at Steak 954 again and the food was great but service was a little lacking and semi arrogant. The new sushi bar is a great new option off the gorgeous new designed bright and welcoming lobby. They really did a great job bringing forward the decor design of the whole property. We are looking forward to trying the New Mexican inspired restaurant in the new year as well. There is still work and changes coming but it will not interfere with you comfort and vacation. We love it so much we do not even need to go in the ocean but we did of course. The W also comps city beach chairs with towel service right out front on the ocean. Not sure if this will be a ongoing thing but it is defiantly a plus to enjoy that extension of the hotel.

I stayed at the W with my wife and family from December 25 through December 29. It all started with our first encounter at check in. We met the very nice staff Who checked our bags in early while we went to eat breakfast at the hotel. We arrived early and check in was not till 4 PM. They tagged our bags and kept them for us as well as took our phone number to reach us if the rooms had been cleaned earlier so we could check in earlier. We went downstairs and had a fantastic breakfast again everyone on staff was so very nice. I received a text message saying that our rooms were ready so we headed back up to get our bags and our room assignments. I was pleased to find that as busy as they were they were able to fill my request of having both of our rooms next to each other. Every morning we ordered breakfast to the room and it was always delicious. During the day we spent our time by the pool and had drinks and snacks which again for all delicious and served by the nicest people. For the evenings we would usually go out to eat then return back to the hotel for drinks. There were many activities going on at the hotel and at one point my youngest daughter took advantage of an event and got a free penciled on temporary tattoo. The gym was nice but always very crowded. Everything was clean as possible but it was warm inside due to all the people working out. One other issue that we did have but I did not even call it into the desk because we were having such a good time. Our sliding glass door to the beautiful patio would not lock as it was not lined up appropriately. I hate to even mention that because the service food and general environment of the hotel was so fantastic. Everything we ordered or needed was a phone call away and they responded immediately to get us whatever we requested. I can not wait to return to this hotel everything about it was great. I did read a review with the person was angry at the staff during check in when they requested a later check out time. I experienced just the opposite and fact the staff asked me if I wanted a later check out time. I thought that was nice that they allowed us to check in early and offered a late check out.

Kids running all over the place and screaming and constantly taking over the pool and hot tub. Made two massage appointments a few weeks ago at Bliss and when we checked in to our appointment we were told the spa was under construction and we had to go to one of the suites for our massage. I ended up cancelling the appointment because we would n\u2019t be able to use any of the spa amenities. I would \u2019ve expected they would \u2019ve mentioned this when I made the appointment. To top off the experience I asked twice for a late check out and was told it would n\u2019t be a problem. However at noon housekeeping came and asked us what the hell we were still doing inside the room and told us to get out. I explained that we requested late checkout twice and was told it would n\u2019t be a problem. We call the front desk and they basically told us to leave even though again I had explained that I had requested late checkout and was told 2 times I would n\u2019t be a problem. So we ended up quickly packing up our things and went to the valet desk to request our car which took them 45 min to drive over to the entrance. This was supposed to be a relaxing weekend getaway from the cold winter and it turned into a big disappointment and waste of money.

When we viewed the Hotel online it looked great and as it was my Wifes Birthday I thought I had surprise her with a nice bottle of champagne on ice in the room for when we arrived. I had confirmation from the Hotel that this would be done. However on arrival no sign of the aforementioned Champagne. When I went to complain I was asked to produce the email confirming the order which I did and sent to the Director. He said he had put 100 behind the bar in compensation. No response to my email and then we had another issue. We booked a couples massage and then our plans changed as they do when on Holiday called the spa and went to change the appointment to the next day. They said they could not do this and would have to charge us the full fee of 320 for a massage we did not receive. I wrote to their Director again Raul. but again no response so his message that if there was anything that he could do to make our stay better then to let him know was clearly not trueNedles to say the weekend was MASSIVELY disappointing and the service was also. The suite and I use that term loosely was tiny had no bath and we paid for an upgrade which clearly we did not get. The place was freezing in the evening as they had the door open and the wind was howling through.

Attentive Staff. Fabulous Rooms. Excellent Place for Work or Pleasure. Whatever. Whenever. W Hotel Saved My Sanity. I work in the area every month and come for a few nights. I usually stay at a hotel nearby but it was sold out and I stumbled upon the W as a recommendation from my colleague. As a Lifetime Titanium Elite member with Mariot I was more than pleased with the location staff rooms and amenities offered. Checking in was a breeze. I was in need of a room immediately and my work booked the room while I was in the uber heading from the airport. It was not standard check in time but I was able to snag a room earlier than expected which was nice. Even though my Mariot status was not attached to the reservation it was a pleasant surprise to see the staff assist me in gaining access to a room. The rooms are fantastic. I really liked the fact that I can work on a balcony overlooking the ocean while taking serious calls in the room and experience a bit of bliss at the same time. I called and asked for extra pillows and some were sent right away. The rooms are equipped with wireless internet endless places to charge your phones and various tv stations to watch during my downtime. When it came time to play I relaxed at the pool used the gym for a quick cardio workout and sat at the beach to enjoy some well needed sun. The hotel is perfectly located in Fort Lauderdale next to a plethora of restaurants and eateries \u2026. but let me tell you \u2013. I LOVE STEAK 954. My colleagues recommended this restaurant for a work dinner and it was absolutely the best place to wind down and have cocktails and dinner. My table raved about the stuffed hash browns. You really have to try these. The 20 oz. Prime 50 Day Dry Aged Bone. In NY Strip was magnificent and well prepared. I opted for room service as well and found it to be served fast. El Vez is also another eatery inside the hotel. I highly recommend the Whole Fried Yellowtail Snapper which has a Gulf of Mexico Style garnish to it. I tried to use the spa for a massage but they were booked up. I will try and get a massage on my next trip the second week of February because this would have topped off my experience. Overall I really appreciate the W experience and what the hotel has to offer.
