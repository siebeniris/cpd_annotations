The heat worked well too well. We were pretty hot and had it off the whole time. The pillows were pitiful if you can bring your own do it or maybe they would give you more if you asked. We just worked with it. the blankets were a bit thread bare. So this really was just a place to lay our heads and served the purpose just fine. As other reviews have said clean basic and in the park. Pretty cool to have deer outside our room each day. Dining area was good.

My travel agent trip was a joint venture of the AZ CVB and the Grand Canyon Railway. so it included arriving to the Grand Canyon and staying within the park which I HIGHLY recommend. We stayed here and the El Tovar but visited all of the hotel options within the park and my best suggestion to anyone is to check all of them out and see which best suits your needs. The Maswick Lodge is quite beautiful. The rooms have a rustic feel to it but certainly not out dated. I mean sorry you do not go to the Grand Canyon and expect chrome and glass furniture in your room. It has a western theme going on and I loved it. It is a 3 diamond property and trust me on this stay all of our hotels were 3 and 4 diamond properties. We are in the 2 story tower and were in the bottom floor and we walk out and there is a drink machine. We have big oversized furniture with lots of browns and reds and again a rustic yet charming feel going on. The bathroom is just basic but serves its purpose. and the bathtub felt great to sink into after a day of exploring. And I love their soap with the hole in the middle. The Maswick Lodge where you check in is incredible. They have a caf\u00e9 on site and a very nice gift shop where you will find one of only 2 ATMS around. Our room was a very short walk to the lodge. You can catch the bus here that runs throughout the park and village. And because this is the largest of the hotels here buses run very often. You are within walking distance of the rim.

My travel group of 8 reserved 2 rooms within the park and had limited choices since we were reserving close to our travel dates. One room was in El Tovar and was an absolutely gorgeous suite in an historic hotel. The second room was here and to be honest we spent more time hanging out here and at Maswik Lodge food court than at the spacious suite at El Tovar. I am sure most of this depends on the type of accommodations you prefer but if you do not mind a basic room with easy Canyon and trail access and easy access to Maswik Lodge whose cafe has something for everyone this is a great choice. Note. I had read that there are differences in the rooms between Maswik South and Maswik North. The rooms at South are significantly less but have no air conditioning. I originally reserved at South but chickened out because of the heat wave they were going through at the time I reserved.

Our room was freezing and our heater did not act like it was working so we contacted the front desk and they sent the maintenance man right over. He let us know that it is motion sensitive and should warm up and it did. Yay. We got to see Sunset and Sunrise at the Canyon. it is just breathtaking. We ate breakfast and a snack at Maswik Lodge. They were decent meals and fairly priced. We ate dinner at Bright Angel restaurant. It was ok. The bread pudding dessert was the best part. Overall we would stay here again.
