We arrived at the airport and had prearranged and prepaid for our private transfer to the hotel mistake 1. As we walked out of the terminal we noticed a gentlemen holding an JW Mariot sign and was gathering arriving passengers to take to the hotel. We failed to notice that when you make a reservation this is an option. Nevertheless we arrived at the JW Mariot a short while later and were greeted by some of the most friendly staff members I have ever encountered in Cancun including my many previous trips and stays at other properties. Check in was quick but personable the gentlemen gave us a great run down on the resort. A friendly bellman escorted us to our room while showing us additional highlights along the way. The arrival experience was very well orchestrated as we were easily turned over from check in to bellman each touching different points of view in the hotel. Our room was quite large we had reserved only a standard room. Upon arrival we walked by this wall of glass into the main sleeping area with private patio as we were ground level. Returning to the wall of glass. I walked through the door in the center to be amazed by the huge bathroom. Large double sinks at the center of the room were surrounded by a large walk in shower private toilet and an over sized tub. I have stayed in rooms in Italy and France that were smaller than the bathroom at this resort. Originally we were disappointed with a ground level room as we wanted a view. The reality was we could not have been in a better location. We walked to the end of the corridor and about 50 feet beyond that was the main pool area which is where we spent all of our time. So the reality of not being in a room with a view ultimately did not make a difference as we really just slept in the room. We enjoyed not having to jump in an elevator to enjoy the numerous amenities offered. The resort has several restaurants for dining we enjoyed the breakfast buffet in the Sedona Grill OUTSTANDING food and service. After day one our server greeted us in the morning and escorted us to an outside table overlooking the pool and the beach. The buffet is monstrous. There are tons of non traditional American breakfast items like sushi pot stickers Mexican specialties South American smoked fish. I was amazed at the over 15 types of fresh fruit offered each day. Service at the pool equaled our experiences elsewhere in the hotel we were not disappointed when the pool butler kept an eye on our drinks and seemed to come by at the just the right time for a refresh. It was a very relaxing experience everything that we were looking for in a long weekend. We have already made reservations to return twice this year and looking forward to spending more time at this beautiful resort.", "offset": [2454, 2656], "date": "2015-04-04", "cpt": "0", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "44a0fbac-5a31-4cdf-b022-a3d14e487ca0", "sentence": "Nice but room for improvement.

Already missed it. If you are reading this review asking yourself if you should book this hotel vs an all inclusive resort nearby stop reading and make the reservation. We really enjoyed our 7night vacation at this JW. We tried all the food options Sedona Grill Beach Walk Gustavo Italian restaurant pool side drinks the lobby bar and the pastries at the gift shop. All very delicious and high quality. Staff in all location are super friendly and attentive. We celebrated our anniversary at Gustavo and at the end of the dinner they brought us a lovely red rose and chocolate dessert. Very sweet. The live music in the restaurant was very relaxing and the service was great. Our every day favorite was the buffet breakfast at Sedona Grill. Lots of fresh options and lovely staff. We were happy to see Edgar every morning greeting us. After the first day he remembered our favorite morning drinks. Overall very good food options. We tried a night pass at one of the fanciest all inclusive resorts to spend a night with our friends who were staying there and the food and drink were no where close to what we had at the JW. Hotel itself is so bright and clean with lovely pools and beach. There were plenty of comfortable pool chairs available at any time of the day. The pool staff was so attentive and took away the unused towels very quickly so the chairs would become available. The room had a lovely view of the ocean lagoon and pools. We really enjoyed the balcony. The housekeeping was great. We were happy to be back to clean bathroom and dry towels every day. Elena made cute ducks with towels on placed it on our bed which made us smile. Unfortunately Club 91 was closed due to renovation. The SPA had lots of amenities but the facial was not the best. And as other reviews mentioned the construction noise was loud during the last two days of our stay but none of this was bad enough for me to take away a star.

I can not over emphasize how great the staff are at the JW. My family of 4 with two teenagers stayed at the JW for a week. The pool staff concierge bellmen and the staff that assist with taxis were so pleasant and friendly that it really made a difference in our stay. I am a platinum member and stayed on the 12th floor which is the top floor before club 91. I slept like a baby and if it were not for reading trip advisor would have never known that the hotel was under renovation. I did not hear nor see any construction going on. It does appear that the rooms closest to the elevators have been renovated and then some random rooms along the other main hallway. The fitness area was nice with about 10 treadmills weights and other cardio equipment. The fitness center also gives you access to an adult only indoor pool and huge hot pool. The outdoor pool was great plenty of seats and there are many shade umbrellas. There are also two hot tubs. The buffet at Sedona grill was plentiful you could have a Mexican Asian European or American breakfast. It was also very nice to have the Mariot Cancun just a short walk through an enclosed corridor. we ate several times at the Mariot Cancun restaurants sports bar and Japanese steakhouse. We booked two excursions Chichen Itza and Xplor through the in house tour agent which was convenient.

My family of 3 stayed here for 4 nights in early January after I wrapped up a short business trip in another nearby resort. Coming from a mid range all inclusive resort which was pretty nice but not extra luxurious the JW was a real treat. I was going to give this a 4star review due to a noise problem we had with a very large corporate group hosting a beachfront party with blaring loud music on the beach immediately below our 8th floor room but Edouard the Guest Services Director was quick to address our concerns at checkout so I am moving the review back to 5 stars. By the way when you are paying top dollar for a 5star luxury resort that resort should NOT allow for loud corporate parties to run well into the night we literally could not sleep on one of the two nights the same corporate group with hundreds of people. were partying down on the beach. Mostly due to the very loud music but also strobe lights etc. creating an issue for our 11 year old son trying to sleep on the pull out sofa bed. For the JW Mariot to chase after this additional revenue when its customers are already paying top dollar hopefully for some peace and quiet is just not right. The staff here are amazing. Special shout outs to Joel at the Beach Walk Restaurant Christopher at the Front Desk Concierge area and Erika and Flor who were our housekeepers. Any request we had was quickly fulfilled. The staff here just seem to go above and beyond to make their guests happy. We stayed in an Oceanfront Suite which was a very spacious and upscale multi room unit on the 8th floor looking directly over the beautiful beach and Caribbean Sea. This suite had not yet been remodeled as some of the individual rooms on the lower floors already had but it was still quite comfortable and in good shape despite the 1990s era decor. We can not wait to return and see how the remodel affects the look and feel of the Suites. Food was overall good if as expected a bit pricey this being a 5star resort where you are somewhat of a captive audience. Sedona Grill has a great upscale atmosphere and solid food but a bit pricey. We ate lunch several times at the Beach Walk restaurant great ceviche and seafood tacos. There are a few more reasonably priced restaurants within a couple of blocks walk on the main highway fronting the property. The JW is also connected via a long winding corridor to the adjacent Convention Center and the Mariot Casa Magna which provided more meal options with its restaurants. The public bus runs every 5 7 minutes up and down the resort strip and to downtown Cancun which offers a more authentic Mexican town experience with many good quality local food options. The beach as with most of Cancun is very wide and beautiful but drops quickly and steeply down to the ocean where winter waves were choppy and required some extra attention to avoid being bowled over by a large wave. We still had fun in the water and I am sure other times of year the beach is more uniformly swimable. The pool system here is really fantastic with a free flowing form and many many nicely cushioned high end loungers and palaces. We also paid the 120 to reserve one of the amazing Balinese Day Beds Palapas overlooking the beach. Well worth the splurge weather allowing. Overall this was an amazing stay and we hope to return this time enjoying the building renovations and more of the amazing JW Mariot Cancun service.", "offset": [1857, 1947], "date": "2018-04-10", "cpt": "0", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 9, "uid": "cb0b3972-3902-4078-8957-d5743f9584f8", "sentence": "Service is above and beyond.

The hotel was upfront about the noise even on their website and they start work at 9amIts not always banging or cutting till 101am till 7PM so go out and hang at the pool or beach. The service is exceptional with reception and staff onsite. Bellhops were awesome too. Sedona grill staff was exceptional and Gustino Restaurant had exceptional and top notch service as well as food. I ate there 3 nights in a row and everything was great. Better than the service at Ruth Chris or Harrys in Cancun. Ask for the Dolce Dessert and get the Mozzarella Bar appetizers. They are all wonderful. Overall experience was great but I look forward to the renovations to be completed and hopefully they modernize the Pool area. Those tiki hut tops are antiquated and the hotel should shift to a more modern look just like the rooms they are updating too. One negative is that the pool service is slow and the food comes cold the entire week I was there. I mean Tacos should come quick and hot Alcohol should be one of the fastest things to serve. I went to have rooms service later in the week instead because of the slow and cold food. I will have to say that it is one of the best I have had across the many hotels I have stayed in across the globe. The food come hot and exactly how you ordered it and within the time they say.

This was my first time staying at the JW Mariot in Cancun. I was here for a week and I came alone to clear my mind before making a big decision regarding my career. I felt safe the entire time I was there. The beach and pool were a short walk away from the elevators and they had lounge chairs and little tree type covers providing shade. I was there February 17 22 and it was super windy so just FYI. There are three restaurants on the property and three restaurants in the adjacent Mariot property. The walk to the Mariot is not too long of a walk but not short either. The odd thing about the hotel right now is that it is undergoing renovation so there is a lot of construction. I stayed on the 5th floor on the side facing the Mariot and in a room that had not yet been renovated. It was fine but the carpet was worn and the furniture was older. The bed was comfortable and everything was pretty clean. I liked the bathroom it was large and the shower temperature and pressure were good. I took a bath one night and the water came out yellowish but than went back to normal so that was kind of hot. The hot water in general smelled kind of weird but I imagine that might just be related to the regional differences. The food at the restaurants was decent but I would not say it was the best I have ever had. I used the gym 3 of the 7 days I was there and it was somewhat crowded in the mornings and less so in the afternoons. The gym has a handful of treadmills and elliptical machines so sometimes I would have to wait. There were also various machines for arms legs and abs and also free weights. The spa which is upstairs from the gym was pretty nice too. I got two massages and they were decent but not the best I have had. I had also say they were a bit overpriced but that is to be expected. The spa has a relaxing waiting area with tea water and snacks and also a shower hot tub and bathroom with amenities lotion hair dryer q tips etc. Overall value I would say was good. I paid 250 night which included a 50 resort credit however when I got my final bill I found that the amount of taxes per night roughly equaled the resort credit so that was kind of misleading on their part. The staff is friendly throughout the hotel but some of them did not understand English so brush up on your basic Spanish skills. I would recommend this hotel only AFTER the renovation and related construction is completed. Some other reasons for the four stars include 1. One morning with my breakfast room service one of the cream cheese containers were old green and moldy which was kind of nasty see picture and 2. every day on the beach were vendors selling items ie hats purses souvenirs jewelry cigars etc from 9 am to 5 pm. It was pretty annoying and there was only one time in the six days that I was there where the lifeguard on duty told them to go elsewhere.", "offset": [2349, 2442], "date": "2019-03-14", "cpt": "1", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 13, "uid": "e92cfb1d-d3f0-4151-853e-44c679eb4f65", "sentence": "Good resort but lacks fun. Me and my wife visited this hotel for 8 days. It was mainly to relax for a bit. Overall we were quite happy but needs some improvements. Check in. we opted for club 91 as it was only 20 dollars more than cheapest room. With club 91 for our stay transportation from and to airport was included. The transportation was on time. Once we reached hotel they directly took us to club 91 to check in. This was bit weird as there was nothing to welcome at the main entrance. The club 91 is also same place where they have food breakfast lunch dinner. So it \u2019s like check in is happening at the reception of the restaurant. It would be better if they just do check in at front desk of hotel. Club 91. For the price we paid I think it was totally worth it. We had breakfast and dinner there almost every day. Breakfast was mostly similar everyday. Dinner was named as Discovery hour which starts at 6 pm till 750 pm. During discovery hour they would have food from one of the JW or Mariot restaurant. The choices are not too many but the quality and taste of the food is really good. Also drinks are included at Club 91. As it was just 20 dollars more we felt it was worth it. Room we were in renovated room. The room is really good and it matches the pictures from website. We did not had any ongoing construction on our floor floor 12 but it was on lower floors. We were not in our rooms any of the days. Although it did not bothered us much you can still hear construction noises when you are at the pool. Pool and Beach area there are mainly 2 pool areas. Adult pool and common pool area. Adult pool has swim up bar which closes at 5 and it \u2019s not a infinity pool. Common pool area has infinity pool. The pools are salt water pool. So you can be in them for much longer. They have pool and beach side cabanas but we found most of the days they were empty. Service the overall service at the pool at the club 91 is really great. Though we felt that club 91 is understaffed in peak hours. Fun factor This is where this resort needs improvement. We have stayed at other hotels in Cancun before and they would have lot more activities near the pool area game rooms entertainment events etc. We did not found any activity. The pool area was also really quite. Not even some music in the background. Considering the wide variety of pools this is a much needed improvement. With sand dollar package 50 usd credit per day we felt it was really good deal.

Better the 2nd Time Around. Last year was the first year I visited this property and I wrote a detailed review about how horrible my experience was. I actually planned to never come back to this property because of the terrible service. I received a message that the property had been upgraded and was under new management so I was encouraged to give it another try by Mariot Leadership. I thought it was only fair that I re reviewed this property since my 2nd experience has been much better than my last. The check in process was much better than the last. I checked in using the mobile ap again but this time my room was actually ready at the time I requested as further confirmed by a message I received. The front desk staff was very pleasant and professional and recognized my Titanium status appropriately. I still had to request they look for an upgrade for us which is supposed to be done automatically but the staff did look for me and upgraded my room and my clients room as well to a larger ocean view room. The rooms are MUCH better now that the renovations are over see pictures they look more modern and closer to a true 45 star hotel. They also have the keyless mobile entry which is awesome. They look more like the amazingly beautiful rooms at the JW Cabo San Lucas. Last year I was here at the JW Cancun during the start of the renovations and our rooms were bombarded with the noise of the hammering and drilling and such which was very disappointing. Post renovations the rooms now are very light and airy with awesome bedding colors a really nice bathroom upgrade and a truly amazing shower see pictures. The hallways carpeting color scheme and light fixtures have all been upgraded and look very nice. A major advantage from the renovations is the new adult pool and swim up bar see pictures. I am actually penning this post from the pool now. It is open to those 18 and up and is properly staffed and managed. The staff is great and very attentive and the food and drinks are good. It has been my favorite part of the resort thus far. Kudos to Mariot for this addition very smart on your part for adult business travelers. My second favorite place at this property which was my first favorite place last year is the Spa. Although nothing has changed since last year the gym is still nice and has pretty nice and well maintained equipment and is very clean. The staff is helpful and friendly. Yesterday we spent the entire day at the Spa and had a great time. My client had massage services from Alexandria and he said she was amazing. Last year I was here I had a decent massage from the staff but then there was a visiting masseur Sean Jordan who was an expert in Tu Na and Thai massages. The manager of the Spa knew that I was a fan of deep tissue massages so he suggested that I experience Mr Jordans Tu Na services I was very hesitant but he encouraged me and told me if I did not like it he would pay for it. I truly appreciated the offer so I tried it and it was the best massage I have ever had in my life and I get massages twice a month back in the US. I would encourage the JW to bring him back because he was amazing. However yesterday I had a deep tissue massage with Alejandro and it was one of the best deep tissue massages I have ever had. He was extremely professional knowledgable and very effective. I was amazed at how great the massage was because I was not expecting it to be at that level. I encourage all of my readers if you come here and you like deep tissue Alejandro s massages are amazing. I left feeling extremely relaxed so much so that I stayed at the spa for another 3 hours just napping on the lounge chairs and enjoying the whirlpool. I plan to go back before the end of my trip for sure. Although this trip has been immensely better than my last experience here there are a couple of complaints I have about my experience thus far. First we ate at the Japanese Restuarant last night called Miakdo which we enjoyed last year. I ordered Tepanyaki with chicken fried rice. We did not eat at the hibachi table and instead at a regular table outside. It was clear to me that I received the leftover food from someone elses hibachi table. The food tasted good but was cold and was more of an appetizer size than an actual dinner portion. Our server apologized for that and said she was only doing what she was told by the manager which was extremely disappointing. I was not offered anything to remedy my concern and instead had to go to the 750 degrees restaurant for a slice of pizza. Secondly the last time I was here the manager at the spa and the GM of the property said that they would ensure that I had access to the spa services at no charge if when I come back. There is a new manager of the Spa who said they did not know of such arrangements so that was concerning. I am a Titanium Member which means I stay at Mariots more than I stay at my own home. I am also very close to reaching the ambassador level so I would expect that when I arrive at the property and request access to the spa that it is granted especially since it was promised to me due to the troubles I had last year. Also I was just at the JW Cabo two months ago who has a much nicer spa than Cancuns and it is free for all Silver members and higher so I am not sure why Cancun is still charging people to use their pool and sauna steam room. In addition to all of this I am paying for two rooms on this trip since I have my client here on our annual business retreat so I would expect better service especially since I am a Titanium level member. I have a few more days here at this property so hopefully I will have this issue resolved by today. Overall I do encourage my readers friends fellow doctors and family to give this place a shot.

They had a crew raking it a couple times a day so there was no real odor and it did n\u2019t keep us from going in the ocean.", "offset": [0, 28], "date": "2019-08-20", "cpt": "2", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 18, "uid": "a49367dd-18e4-4ff2-a602-6c8ec0801f21", "sentence": "CANCUN IN DECEMBER. My husband and I and my sister and brother in law spent 6 wonderful nights at the JW Mariot in Cancun last December. This was our first visit to Cancun. The ocean is spectacular turquoise clear and warm. The hotel was beautifully decorated for Christmas with gorgeous Christmas trees and a very special gingerbread house village. Everything was festive and lovely. A remodel of the hotel was still going on. Matter of fact some parts of their large meandering swimming pools were closed. But we had sufficient and lovely pool areas to enjoy. The rooms are contemporary nice bathrooms comfortable beds. The view from our room was gorgeous. All members of the staff were very friendly and helpful. We had delicious buffet breakfasts daily at the hotel which was included. We also dined a few times at the Ritz Carlton nearby which was fabulous. I recommend the hotel and Cancun. We felt safe and it was beautiful.", "offset": [385, 427], "date": "2019-09-09", "cpt": "2", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 19, "uid": "a0a3ea22-9736-44a1-b7f3-513dd133ef04", "sentence": "What a shame. After a 2 year break we decided to return to the JW Mariot and are sorry to report the service has went down hill. It all began with a mixup at the airport where we asked for a private ride but were forced to wait for 30 mins in the heat for a couple that never showed up. I am a Mariot Bonvoy Titanium member and they made us pay for a suite upgrade despite being at 20 occupancy. We had housekeeping mixup we that to request our room to be cleaned 3 times. The our time on the beach felt like we needed a pop up ad blocker as they allow the vendors to camp out on their beach chairs. Every 5 minute you ate asked to buy something. Lastly we asked for a room service dinner in our room with some candles and they made it a huge ordeal. We discussed with the manager and were promised points as compensation and never followed through. Despite the new renovations to the building the management needs renovations as well to deliver good service. Some employees went way out of their way to make our stay well and it is a shame that the mismanagement and broken promises take away from them. Sergio Jose Elizabeth Garcia Ludin are all amazing and should be promoted to manage this hotel as they tried to make our stay pleasant and delivered.", "offset": [850, 959], "date": "2019-09-11", "cpt": "2", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 20, "uid": "2876d754-4b79-462e-b265-3cc3383b3218", "sentence": "Superb. we have stayed at the JW in Dubai many times so when we booked here we hoped we would get the same standard and it did not disappoint. What makes this hotel is the staff. Obviously there are differences in each country but the quality is just as good. We were very pleased when we got an upgrade to the Caribbean Suite. It was amazing. It had a double balcony and 2 huge tvs. The bathroom is incredible and I love the toiletries. We had paid for Club 91 access which was good but not excessive. The breakfast was the best Marco makes the best omletes and the coffee machine is fab. There is enough to eat all day but there is not any choice for the main meal. We ate out a couple of times which was the best balance we thought. The staff in the Club room were amazing especially jazmin. The drinks are good and you can make your own bloody Mary and Bellinis for breakfast. The pools are great and the servers even remember your name. The adult area was good with the swim up bar. The hotel was very quiet so we did not use the Margarita bar. We did order pizza from 750 sent to the room on a rainy day which was a treat. You can also use the walk through the hotel to use the Mariot hotel and facilities. We could not fault this hotel in standards but what makes it is the staff and the renovated rooms and the pools beach.", "offset": [1213, 1331], "date": "2019-11-23", "cpt": "2", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 21, "uid": "bd138751-83e5-4477-99bf-3e36354a835d", "sentence": "100 Disappointed.

My wife and I spent 4 nights here this January and we absolutely loved it. It never felt crowded. The rooms seem to have been remodeled in the last year or so. They were bright and airy. We had a one bedroom ocean front suite a high floor and it had spectacular views. There were always available chairs at the pool maybe not the ones that you wanted but that was because we never got there early. Service was friendly and very responsive to any request. We went off sight to eat other than breakfast so I can not speak to the food. Breakfast was very good for a buffet. pretty typical Mariot resort breakfast.
