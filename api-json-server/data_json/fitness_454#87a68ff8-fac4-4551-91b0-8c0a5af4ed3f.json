Good value for money. So the location is of course excellent. When being checked in and out of the hotel the staff were extremely welcoming helpful and friendly particularly advising us on things to do. The reception lounge was inviting with a fire and sofas and in the morning free tea and coffee is served in the evening free wine. Free flavoured water is available in the lobby throughout the day as bottled water is charged in the room. The restaurant next door served an excellent breakfast and was accessible through the hotel. I thought maybe a little pricey for a breakfast but this was standard pricing in this area I believe as we ate in Denys the next day and it was a similar price. On to the room both air conditioning and heating quiet comfy bed reasonable size bath was on the smaller size but shower adequate. TV and free internet available with good connection speed. The view. well there was not really one the trouble with my room was that I did not have a view of the street but of an adjacent wall which meant that not a lot of light came in to my room so if this is a problem for people maybe request a street view to let some light in. This was not a problem for my stay though as the location was convenient and I was out a lot the room was used for sleeping and cleaning. get out and explore San Fran was my motto. There is no gym on site and as a regular gym goer this concerned me but I was relieved and pleasantly surprised that we had free access not discounted as some posts seem to suggest to 24 Hour gym which was just across the road. Overall for the price I paid I was very happy with my stay here and it retained the feel of a classy respectable comfortable hotel WITH CHARACTER unlike some chains.

We were told the hotel had just reopened after remodel so some of the kinks are understandable however their power system in the rooms are run on a wall sensor. It kept shutting off while we were watching a television show and when we called the desk they were very busy. They sent a maintenance man who is very nice but after 3 visits to the room he changed the wall sensor which actually shuts everything down if it does not detect movement in the room for 30 minutes straight. I suppose we could have waved our arms every 30 minutes and gotten some exercise but by 10 at night the problem still was not fixed and we were moved to another room.

The only thing they care is how to cover up for their own negligences by shifting it to the guests.

Can you com back again later. I had to come back again and again losing my valuable time in SF. Eventually I asked for a copy of my ID in front of the police officers hotel clerk Jurita then admitted that they did not save a copy of my ID onto the computer so that they could not provide me with a copy.
