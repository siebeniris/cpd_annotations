Great location close to restaurants shopping Coconut Marketplace is walkable. Not too far from Airport after a long flight from the east coast.

Also I understand that the chickens are part of the culture they do not bother me at all but their po on the pool deck does.

I was seated next to a man at the pool on Saturday morning who was a guest he was on the phone inviting all his family and friends over to use the pool for the day. They descended on the pool well before lunch and stayed til about 6 pm. They took up 6 chairs and crowded the pool. They got into the hotel by walking right through the front lobby right past the security guard. What good is a security guard if people can just walk right into a hotel. If there had been hotel management staff coming through the pool area every once in a while they would have noticed this. It was clear through my conversation with this man that he does this fairly frequently he was planning on being back in 2 weeks. If this was a huge pool with plentiful seating I would not have minded as much. But for 2 days in a row I had to sit away from the pool in the afternoon in a chair rather than next to the pool in a lounger because Non guests were taking up so much room. Their kids also crowded out the hot tub all day because the pool water was too cool for them. Housekeeping was below par First day I asked her for extra towels and she gave me some off the cart. Next day when she cleaned she took them all and only left a couple towels. And she left no conditioner. So I went down hall and asked for more. Same thing the next morning and every morning. So for 6 mornings in a row I had to ask for towels and for conditioner. Her cleaning of the room was cursory. No new glasses cups.

The bartender was annoyed telling me she did not wait on me. At breakfast the same thing happened and my husband had to go up to the hostess station and ask for our check.
