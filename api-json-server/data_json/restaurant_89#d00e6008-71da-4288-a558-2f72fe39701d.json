My wife and I joined by her elderley parents had booked a package of two nights bed and breakfast and dinner on the first night at a very reasonable price. First impressions of the hotel were excellent as was the greeting at reception I had contacted the hotel in advance requesting a downstairs room for her parents as they are not very mobile this had been allocated and my wife and I in the room next to theirs. The rooms were clean and comfortable but a little tired but certainly nothing to complain about. We had a drink in the bar before dinner which was comfortable and had a great view down to the river. As we went into dinner things went downhill this was a Sunday night and only two other couples were staying it seemed that the absolute minimum staff were on duty. What I later learned was the supervisor was acting as waiter and from his demeanour wished he was not there. The current menu for Mercure is reasonable but not the most exciting we placed our orders only to find that half the items were off so two of us ordered steak one curry and mother in law a burger. In addition we ordered a bottle of wine this was just dumped on the table unopened. We then heard another customer complain about her food it was luke warm and the plate was cold. Our food finally arrived my wifes was really hot the steaks which we had ordered rare were medium and warm but the chips hot. Mother in law said hers was OK. I decided not to complain about the steak as everything else seemed OK. As we finished the first course I noticed that Mother in law had not eaten the burger itself just the roll and chips she said it was too tough my wife tried it and said it was like an old piece of leather. We complained about the burger and steaks when the supervisor collected the plates and he just said sorry with a shrug of the shoulders. Both other couples also complained about aspects of their meal. Next morning breakfast and what a difference a pleasant waitress food served to order on red hot plates. The second night we ate elsewhere wanting to experience a decent meal. One of the previous nights couples ate in again and said it was even worse than the previous night. On leaving we complained at reception and the wine was taken off the bill. If I had not eaten dinner I would give this hotel a four but the dining experience was so bad I only raten it as a two.", "offset": [1733, 1869], "date": "2015-04-10 00:00:00", "cpt": "0", "category": "restaurant"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "28dfd781-a963-41a1-9eb8-785766b5e729", "sentence": "good location shame about the Breakfast. this hotel looks lovely on the web site but i am afraid it is looking very tired inside and could benefit from some tlc. it also praises itself on it is breakfast which in all my years of traveling around the world this takes the prize of the worst yet. especially for the price. coffee tasted as if it had been made a week before using cheap instant very poor choice of fruit if you wanted a continental breakfast only and the choice of bread was sliced or a stale loaf no cheese or ham etc. so opted for scrambled and mushrooms big mistake scrambled overcooked and mushrooms tasted awful. and to top it all not a happy waitress serving and made a lot of noise banging plates on the table not a pleasant start to the day. this hotel is not up to Mercure normal standards.", "offset": [162, 294], "date": "2015-07-16 00:00:00", "cpt": "0", "category": "restaurant"}, {"id": 2, "uid": "6f943b78-c796-4bff-b83d-653a7a0974c6", "sentence": "CHRISTMAS DAY LUNCH. On arriving at the Newton Park Hotel for Christmas Day lunch first impressions were very good. There was a beautiful large Christmas tree in the reception area and we were shown to our reserved table and the atmosphere felt lovely. Unfortunately this is where the impressive stopped. The starter prawn crayfish cocktail and the main turkey were excellent. However after all being sat at the same time for the 1 pm sitting the table next to us had not even been asked for their drinks order let alone had any food by the time we were finishing our main course. For desert I had ordered cr\u00e8me Brule a firm favourite of mine which was beautifully presented however was very over cooked and me and my partner sent these back which they were happy to do. We spoke to another family who also commented the same about the cr\u00e8me Brule. We had the other desert of chocolate which was better. There was quite a gap in between the next courses and you could tell the whole atmosphere in the room had changed and people were getting a little impatient. The fourth course of cheese board was then bought out minus any side plates or cheese knife. I requested these from a waitress and after waiting for 5 minutes or so became apparent that these were not coming to us as the same waitress was then serving other tables. Other diners then went to the kitchen themselves to collect the plates for their party. We and the table next to us had to use the saucers from under our tea cups as side plates and use a blunt table knife to cut the cheese. Also as there were only two of us we were placed on quite a small table and never once did somebody come over and remove empty glasses so by the end of the meal it was rather crowded. I noticed that they were not removing glasses from other tables also. In summary it was a very disappointing Christmas Day lunch which we had paid \u00a3 120 for and were so looking forward to. Overall the food was good bar the desert but the terrible service really let the place down. Six of us wish to go out for Christmas Day lunch 2016 and it is safe to say we wo nt be booking the Newton Park Hotel.", "offset": [1328, 1415], "date": "2016-01-04 00:00:00", "cpt": "0", "category": "restaurant"}, {"id": 3, "uid": "fe15bd24-e237-41fa-9477-bc1f33dae25f", "sentence": "The hotel is tired and desperately in need of refurbishment.

The bedroom 29 was a little disappointing given its layout. Clearly the room had once been part of the old house but it was very dark by the desk as there was no natural light and the bathroom seemed unusually large given it had so little in it while the bedroom part was disappointingly small given that the bed and desk took up all of the room. Food was very good if greatly over priced. We ended up ordering snack type meals given that the wedding we attended served food very late. The panini i ordered was more like a sandwich in toasted bread not sure how a panini can be a panini if the cheese has not melted but the chips were lovely and you got lots of filling. The chef waiter also appeared to not know his sauces and gave my husband red sauce when he asked for brown crucial given that he ordered a bacon sandwich and we all known brown sauce is the one true sauce for a bacon sandwich. As someone with IBS it would have been nice to have a greater selection of soft drinks available at the bar and perhaps water in the room as an alternative to tea.

Kirsty outlined everything which was included in the conference and clear pricing stated. Kirsty advised us to have Wiliam 12 which to say was a stunning room is truly and understatement. The views over the grounds were beautiful the room sat alongside the conservatory where meals were served for lunch. Food was amazing. The cookies are surely homemade and divine served with the morning tea and coffee. Eleanor oversaw the day and supported the delegates. She was professional and friendly nothing was too much trouble and she brought extra cookies out as they were so nice people had taken more than one eachParking is free and plenty of spaces for our delegates. However the previous day there were over 100 delegates and the car park was full so it was n\u2019t easy to park that day. Maybe something to keep in mind depending on how big your party is.

We came to the bar just before 80 to find no table set up which was disappointing talking to the bar staff they gave us a restaurant menu to order from which we did and then it took nearly an hour to get food by which time the bar was getting very busy and understandably the staff were busy at the bar we ended up ordering dessert to be sent to our bedroom so we could relax. Massive compliments to the chef as the food was amazing we have eaten in a few hotels and this was among the very best and your staff were friendly and helpful I do realise you were very busy with a party and a coach trip but felt a little disappointed in the way we were treated it was not the relaxing night away we were hoping to have.", "offset": [455, 665], "date": "2019-11-27 23:31:00", "cpt": "1", "category": "restaurant"}, {"id": 19, "uid": "b690d310-17c4-4e56-a9f2-1088c11c1d36", "sentence": "Nice break and murder mystery. Stayed with my wife on a 1 night dinner BB and 1920s themed murder mystery night with afternoon tea. The hotel has a lot of character and has some lovely features throughout.

Comfy bed good quality duvet and decent spec tv. The shower cubicle was large and water hot and powerful. Afternoon tea was plentiful and yummy. Very good value. Ourfod in the evening was good. The chef was cooking for about 70 and the food came out quickly with no one having to wait. The profeiter rolls were huge. Which was good staff cleared plates quickly. Breakfast was busy but staff worked hard to keep the buffet topped up. Good selection of cereal and pastries and usual hot food. There is a nice reading room near to the restaurant and the bar area is nice place to have a drink. Drink prices was good value as far as hotels go. I asked for a half coke but was given a pint the barmaid let me have the pint for price of a half which was a nice touch. We did nt go out into the gardens but it looked like they would look lovely in the summer. A few things that could be worked on You see bins almost as soon as you drive in. They could be screened off or moved out of site. Flag poles could do with a clean and flags a bit tatty. Main entrance steps and surrounding area could do with a jet wash. Lose the chess pieces. Mucky and do nt add anything. Main door is a bit tired. All these things are as you drive in and do nt give a great impression. Plus they will not cost a lot to sort outAnd yes main carpet needs replacing. These are not fundamental things and we really enjoyed our stay and have some good memories.
