Walk the paths and see bottles thrown into the bushes common area bathrooms near the pool are filthy issues in the units show failure of thorough checks by maintenance engineering and housekeeping prior to new guest arrival. We had a flood in our unit caused by the washer drain hose taken out of the drain. The dryer filter and vent line had a huge clump of lint totally blocking the vent. Failure to communicate effectively with guests especially owners regarding owner only events.

First and foremost I wish somebody at Mariot would occasionally read some of the reviews placed here because some of them are clearly for Frenchmans Reef the full service hotel next door and not Frenchmans Cove which is the timeshare. I can usually spot them from the lower ratings and people constantly complaining. My wife and I just returned from another great one week stay at the Cove. Everything was in perfect running order and the weather was absolutely perfect. The staff was great as was the overall condition of the property. The bed was heavenly as was the soft bedding. The A C worked very well and the resort even replaced the pots and pans with non stick. I was surprised to see a brand new dishwasher as well. Most of all the unit was super quiet. As always the grounds were in tip top shape including the beach and pool areas. The happy hour at the Sunset Cove was perfect and runs for several hours starting at 40. The one dinner we had there was fairly reasonable and service was attentive. If I had to complain about something and it is hard to do at this place. it would be 1. the drapes in the master bedroom let a lot of light in through the top. I like the room to be pitch black when the drapes are closed if you can not tell. Second and this is not something that can be changed without a major renovation the rooms have a teeny tiny stall shower but a huge non Jacuzi bathtub which nobody uses. Many Vacation Club resorts built recently have great large showers many with multiple heads the Las Vegas Grand Chateau has one of the best. For one of the newest resorts in the Mariot portfolio this was a major faux pas especially since guests here take showers after coming in from the beach sometimes multiple times per day. We have been to many MVCI resorts but this is by far our absolute favorite.", "offset": [1274, 1443], "date": "2016-09-13", "cpt": "0", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 4, "uid": "00b5b574-f42e-46d0-9b4e-dc874ee6c907", "sentence": "Talked to owner services this evening as we have reservations starting on March 4th at the Cove. The news was not encouraging they were informed that the best guess on reopening the resort is February 15th and even that sounded a bit optimistic. When you couple that with the Cove owners newsletter that arrived this week along with the 2018 maintenance and damage fees you come away with a picture of significantly more damage and progress that is not moving too quickly given all the challenges to the island infrastructure. The options available assuming your reservation date is greater then 61 days out and you booked with a deded week is to find another week at the Cove at a later date in 2018 or to convert the week to Mariot Reward points. Which is not a great option as you get 10k points week which given the maintenance fees and added 400 for the Hurricane Insurance deductible says your getting the equivalent of a Courtyard room for a week for your 200 in owners fees. They said that Mariot VC has not decided how or if they will compensate owners who have had their week canceled to date. I assume that over the past 2 months as each week has passed that the growing size of lost vacation weeks and unhappy owners if going to require Mariot VC do something. The devastation to the island infrastructure is clearly the most pressing issue to restoring it not only the Cove but the tourism industry requires more than is happening. Why the Federal agencies can not do more to assist in the recovery is suspect. If Miami had as much damage would it still be as much of a disaster as exists in St Thomas two months after the storms.

ROACHESMy husband and I stayed 3 nights at the Frenchmans Cove last month and was very disappointed and appalled. If I could give this overpriced resort a zero I would. Our 2 bedroom villa with nightly rates starting at 70 plus was infested with roaches. I have videos of this but for some reason it will not let me upload it with this review. Mini roaches were found in the kitchen area on night 2 as we started to prepare dinner. We called the front desk for assistance around 9 pm and was asked if we wanted someone to come tonight or tomorrow we stated tonight. 2 hours later still no one. We called once again and was asked do you want someone to come at this late hour. Again our response was YES. Someone came out and sprayed the kitchen. The next morning housekeeping came and cleaned followed by another hotel worker that moved the appliances in the kitchen finding a roach nest for lack of wording. He then sprayed and reassured us the problem was solved. 3rd and last night we entered the kitchen to find multiple little dead or dying roaches. Needless to say this ruined our use of the kitchen for cooking during our stay. We were never offered a change of villa as the front desk agent stated the hotel was full. We were very upset by this experience. We came to celebrate my husbands birthday at what we thought was a beautifully renovated upscale resort. We are Mariot Vacation owners as well as Mariot Bonvoy members who travel often and love Mariot properties. We have never encountered such an experience in any Mariot property thus far. After speaking with the manager Shantel we were offered 500 Bonvoy points and lunch on them as a type of compensation for our mishaps. I accepted this offer only to be told upon checkout they could only give 150 points. 150 points would not cover a 1 night stay in Mariots category 3 hotels Frenchmans cove is a category 7. Almost 2 weeks later we have not received any points. So for our inconveniences our mishaps in their NASTY ROACH INFESTED villa we got a free lunch.
