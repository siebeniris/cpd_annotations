I read all of the reviews about this hotel and was looking forward to staying at such a nice hotel. We checked in late at night and upon first glance the hotel looked lovely. Since it was late we just went right to sleep without really checking out the room. To my horror when I woke up the next morning and looked at my sheets there was an old stain on them. I also found a long black hair on the clean towels lotion or something on the pictures in the bathroom and a gum wrapper behind the entrance door. Another thing that was upsetting was the noise in the hallway. We are Hilton Diamond members and we requested a room at least five away from the elevator. Needless to say we were right next to the elevator. Folks were coming in and out all through the night. One group decided to have a shouting match at 3 am and at this point I tried to call down to the front desk but the phone in our room did not work. The next morning when I told the desk attendant about the dirty room and the noise in the hallway the only thing they said was we are sorry but since you booked your room with reward points there is nothing that we can do.
