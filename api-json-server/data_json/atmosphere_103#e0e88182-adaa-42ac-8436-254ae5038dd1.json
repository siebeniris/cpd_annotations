On the downside this was one of the poorer quality rooms we have stayed in recent years. The room needed a total redo and the air conditioner and fan were loud. The room was musty smelling and the shower curtain was old and carpet should be replaced. This was not the same standard I expected after staying at other hilton garden inns.

I recently stayed at this property on a business trip to Orlando. Typically speaking as a Diamond member with Hilton I have had a favorable experience with the chain. This unfortunately was not one of those experiences. The hotel property was in decent shape. During my stay the hotel was doing maintenance on the parking lot by painting some of the parking lot markings handicap stop bars etc with fresh paint non skid. My wife had driven in to surprise me and visit Orlando since I was working on my birthday. Since I had a rental car for business we used that vehicle during our stay and left our car sitting in the parking lot during our stay. Upon returning home my wife noticed while unloading the car back at home that there was paint all along the side of our our new car. Its is only 1yr old. My wife immediately called the hotel to discuss this incident and left messages with Tony GM to call her back to discuss this problem. She immediately went up to the local Hyundai dealership to have them look at the paint over spray and assess the damage. They took pictures and documented all of the paint non skid on our vehicle. Roughly 120 in damage to the paint. My wife immediately sent in all the documentation to the hotel and Tony the GMAfter multiple calls to Tony he conveyed that he would pass this along to the owners of the hotel to be submitted to the insurance company to file a claim. We are now going on 3 weeks since filing this information with the hotel and no insurance claim number yet. After multiple calls to the hotel GM Tony we find out he has no idea whom his insurance company is but he has a name to a representative. Tony then conveys to us that he can not do anything to help and can we call the insurance representative to file the claim. SeriouslyAl of this after 3 weeks of no information or returned calls. We have had to track him down on his personal cell number every time. We have tried to leave messages with the owner Dinesh Kalidas Ext 8136 1 407 239 950 but his voice mail is full. Tony tells us he can not even get in touch with him. Great a non reachable absentee owner of a major hotel franchise. We are soon approaching a month that this paint has been on our car. We are not mad it happened BUT we are greatly disappointed on the lack of professional concern response from this franchise to fix the issue. The GM says I can not do anything. RealyThe owner has had zero integrity to return a call to us and we have left multiple messages with the front desk. So now we have being left no other recourse but to involve our insurance company and legal consul to resolve this issue. Visitor beware. If you have an issue do not expect much in the way of a professional response or help from this property. Stay else where if you have the choice. We are still waiting on the owner Dinesh to return a call.", "offset": [101, 201], "date": "2016-11-28", "cpt": "1", "category": "atmosphere"}, {"id": 11, "uid": "f1863085-e7b0-4a6b-b391-748fc1aa797f", "sentence": "Excellent Hotel.

Digital check in was easy but I did not get the room I picked. I had picked a room on top floor facing front of hotel. I had asked what would be the reason of not getting room I picked. Got the answer of the person in that room extended their stay. Ok but I really did not believe that. I felt it was an excuse for them giving my room away to someone else. Even though I did not get the room I wanted the girl at the front desk was very pleasant and welcoming and put a note on my account to get my room moved at a later time if possible. I ended up never following up with it as I did not want to have to move all my stuff again after we had already settled in our room. Room clean comfortable but housekeeping did not stock items very well. Had to ask for towels more than once and cups and toilet paper. If 4 people are in the room leave 4 bath towels. AC loud was a bit loud. Toilet also made noise but was not too bad. We were connected to an adjoining room that had a small dog in it that barked every once in awhile. was not really a nuisance for me but pretty sure it was not a service dog as I saw dog being smuggled in out a few times. We did not spend a lot of time in the room. I would say the biggest annoyance was that it was not stocked well. Parking Shares parking with Homewod Suites. Spots limited. Many times had to park in back which was not an issue except my digital key would not work on back entrance where pool was. Had to walk all the way around to get in. Breakfast Very good. Waitstaf very good and pleasant. I highly recommend room rate that includes breakfast. Lobby Offered water all day coffee tea in morning. Many other HGI offer cookies and fruit throughout day never saw this but I may have missed it. Self Laundry. Only 1 machine. Cost of as 2 a load to wash 2 a load to dry.
