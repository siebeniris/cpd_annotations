We stayed for 3 nights. The hotel is off strip so you have to taxi everywhere. Which is not bad because the taxi service abundant. We were offered a room in the Casino tower above the party pool and even though the view was nice it was very loud with music and people partying till 4 5am. The WiFi which you have to pay for never worked properly. It would drop you every 2 minutes. The bed I had literally had a big lump in the center of the bed which made you want to roll out on each side when you slept in it along with a pillow that was a bunch of stuffing pushed into a huge ball that could not lay your head on. Never seen anything like it. So I went in search for another pillow and found a really flat one but it was better The cleaning service did minimal towels every day. We had 4 in the room and got 2 towels every day and I had to go ask for 2 more every day to shower. We had room service bring coffee in the am and after 70 minutes later we had to call back to get it delivered. We found one restaurant that actually had really good food called FU. The others were just OK. We asked at front desk who the concierge is so we could get some info and no one knewThen we were at the front desk at 515 in the am to check out with one person in front of us. There was only one person securing check outs. It took us 20 minutes waiting one person to get waited on. I have stayed in various hotels in Vegas with no hiccups.

Being that I had just arrived I thought that they would be willing to help but they only offered to send security up to talk with the folks next door. My stay was during a week night and the hotel did not seem that busy. I am not sensitive to noise but I could hear everything my neighbors were saying even when they were talking in regular voices. My neighbors ended up being up all night and had people coming in and out of their room all night as well. Their music was really loud and the Hard Rock staff eventually sent up secuirty to ask them to quiet down. It did me no good because I could still hear everything they were saying. I never got to sleep. Being a father of 25 year old twins who do not sleep through the night I thought my one night stay would give a chance to rest and get some sleep while I was in town for business. I was wrong.

I specifically asked for a nonsmoking room and did not get that either so we came down to the front desk and were told that they could not do anything cause the hotel was booked. So we had to stay in a room that smelled like pure cigarettes. The second day we went down to the front desk and they kept telling us to come back hours later to check availability for the room we originally booked. So about six hours later we received a text notifying us that they finally had a nonsmoking room with a king bed available.

We had to spray our own perfumes to help mask the pungent odor in the room. We had to leave our door open to help air out the smell. The refrigerator is basically unusable since everything is weight sensor. The elevators use a key to get to our floor but half the time it would not work and we would just be suck in the elevator until we could get our key to work.
