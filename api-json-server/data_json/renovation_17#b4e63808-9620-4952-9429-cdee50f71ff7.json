I recently spent 4 days at Hilton Garden Inn Atlanta Perimeter for a business trip. Upon checking in I was asked to present a credit debit card for what I assumed was for incidentals. I handed over my debit card and immediately asked how much was going on my card. The gentleman said it was for the entire hotel stay. I quickly corrected him and told him my place of employment had already taken care of the hotel stay. He checked my account and said my profile had been set up incorrectly but he would update it to reflect the business card for the hotel bill. After charging 50 to my debit card I was all checked in and ready to start my week. Room service was great and the ladies that brought me my food the nights I ordered were very friendly. My room was always clean upon my return from work. All was great until the morning of checkout. I received my bill under the door. I was expecting the charges for room service but my mouth hit the floor when I saw that the room charges were being charged to my DEBIT card and not work account. I immediately called the front desk and was transferred to a nice lady in accounting that assured me she would fix this before the transaction was processed. I thought nothing else of it until I was checking my bank account before making my long journey home and realized my DEBIT card had indeed been charged for stay and not the work account. Let me start by saying I understand mistakes happen but when I specifically told the front desk man upon checkin to make sure my work card was being charged for the room and also spoke to a lady before checkout to correct the mistake that was not corrected the first day and my card it STILL charged really upsets me. I am a single mother and I can not afford to have 500 plus dollars taken from my personal account bc of a hotel mistake. I called the hotel and spoke to someone else in accounting and she told me the issue had been resolved and they were only charging my card for the room service charges but unfortunately since the full amount had been charged to begin with my money will not be placed back into my account until it clears my bank. She told me it could take a few days up to a couple of weeks. I am very upset about this and it has really put me in a financial bind bc it is the first of the month and ALL of my bills are due. Having over 500 taken from my account has really destroyed my budget and will cause some of my bills to be late. I would not recommend this hotel unles you have a plethora of extra funds and can afford to have such a HUGE mistake happen to you. If you can not I would stay far far away. it is unfortunate bc it is a nice hotel with a friendly staff but when I corrected a mistake both the first day of checkin and again before Check out and it was not fixed makes me hesitant to EVER stay here again. I was also charged 50 at checkin and another 50 plus room service charges and hotel stay. Accounts lady could not tell me why I was charged an additional 50. I am so frustrated with this situation and incredibly stressed out now bc of it.", "offset": [471, 612], "date": "2016-09-02", "cpt": "0", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 4, "uid": "54730800-dffa-4392-a89b-ebd9368c8022", "sentence": "Christmas 2016.

I am a loyal Hilton Hhonors member who frequently stays at Hilton brand properties around the world. This is one of the worst properties I have visited. Hilton Garden Inn \u2019s are typically a slam dunk for cleanliness and comfort while traveling on business and being able to count on a decent meal at the end of a long day. This one should be renamed Hilton dump. The hotel is under renovation which appears as uncontrolled filth and I wonder if the walkways in the lobby and leading to the elevators would pass an OSHA inspection. Trip hazards everywhere workers working right over your head spakeling etc. Dust covers everything. Just did n\u2019t think that eating here was worth the risk given the filth. What is the excuse for carpet in hallways on guest room floors is filthy stained dirt trash guest room doors walls etc are beat up peeling paint my door looks like the lock had been jimmied at one point and they tried to just putty it the tile foyer area in my room upon my first entry was full of dirt tracked in and clearly not swept by housekepingrealy old beat up furniture stains all over corner chair broken toilet seat no hot water at the sink even after running for 10 minutes bathroom walls are disgusting dirt stains and mildew clearly visible towel rack in bathroom is all rusted. where clean towels are then placed bathroom has really bad sewer smels I believe coming from the drains housekeeping opened my window and left it wide open on a 100 degree day open for all the bugs to come in. Thankfully after inspecting carefully I found no evidence of bedbugs and bedding seems clean so at least I felt ok getting into bed. The one thing positive is that front desk staff is really friendly and welcoming. Thank you for that. I certainly hope that their renovations include guest rooms and hallways and include replacement of doors fixtures etc. Even post renovations I would not even think of staying here again.
