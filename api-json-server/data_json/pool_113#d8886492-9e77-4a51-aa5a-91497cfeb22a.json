The hotel staff were friendly and professional. The vibe is fantastic during summer the bar is the place to be the evening and has a great crowd. Although the pool is crowded and full of locals trying to act cool the staff always found us a spot they do prioritise their hotel guests which is fantastic. The concierge was friendly and always gave me great advice. Furthermore the view we had from the room was breathtaking we also had a little stylish balcony which was fantastic for the evening during sunset. I would most definitely recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to stay in LA in fact I recommend any hotel by Morgans Hotel Group. Mondrian was the second hotel of their hotels we stayed and and we then went on to Delano and now other 2 of their hotels in NYC as they always deliver and go beyond our expectations.", "offset": [227, 384], "date": "2015-01-18", "cpt": "0", "category": "pool"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "83e7cabc-3ca8-4554-8f31-79d8630a5037", "sentence": "LA visit.

My husband and I booked The Mondrian for our last night of our honeymoon having flown in from a cycling tour around Central America. The hotel has the fun young and vibrant atmosphere we were expecting and we were not disappointed overall. We did have issues with the water supply in our room culminating in us having a plumber visit in the wee hours of the morning but the staff were quick to rectify the issues. Also as there was a pool party on the Sunday the toilets in the lobby were left in quite a disguating state I refrained from using them completely.

I spent a week at The Mondrian at the beginning of May I had been looking forward to the trip for some time and it did not disappoint. This was my first trip to LA and I arrived at about 8 pm. I was greeted by a very friendly lady on reception called Jenny who made check in smooth and stress free. The only thing I would say is that I had to take my case up to my room myself. I could have probably waited for someone to bring it up but no one offered and by that time I was exhausted and just wanted to get up to my room and crash out. I had booked a standard room with no extras and it was very spacious with a great view. In fact I could see right across the city and it is probably one of the best views I have ever had in a hotel. The bathroom had lots of nice little toiletries and a space where you could sit and do your makeup etc. There was no bath but the shower was enormous and was more than adequate. The bed itself was one of the comfiest I have ever slept in. Plenty of hanging space for clothing and even though the number of hangers was limited a quick phone call to housekeeping and I soon had all the hangers I could nedI spent the afternoon of my first day at the hotel relaxing by the pool. The drinks were quite expensive but no more than what you could expect to pay at such a place in LA. The pool area was nice and clean as were the loungers. The only thing I would say is that whilst I was able to get a sunbed at the beginning of the week and to relax and read by the end if the week ie Friday Saturday not a chance. The hotel turns into a party hotel with loud music and not much chance of getting a sunbed and having a quiet read. Despite this being a party hotel at the weekends I have to say the noise level was zero. I was able to get a good nights sleep every night. Towards the middle of the week I had a personal issue nothing to do with the hotel. Jenny on reception went out of her way to help me out and I was very grateful for this. Another member of staff who really stands out at The Mondrian for going out of his way to deliver an excellent standard of service is Greg the concierge. Greg was fantastic at getting me tickets for the parks that I wanted to go to and also for helping me find my way around LA. He was always very cheerful and is a real asset to The Mondrian. I enjoyed room service at The Mondrian on a couple of occasions. The food was delivered quickly and was hot when it came. It was also deliciousCheck out again could not have be more straightforward. would not hesitate to stay at The Mondrian again.", "offset": [992, 1228], "date": "2015-05-24", "cpt": "0", "category": "pool"}, {"id": 4, "uid": "165c607f-b101-4add-95f9-3e24d728b360", "sentence": "Party central.

I stayed on business in CA for 3 days here having booked online. The hotel is disgustingly dirty dated with rubbish in the rooms on balconies and extremly grubby furniture curtains floor etc. I was totally disgusted to stay here as photos in no way matched the ones online. Modrian must be ashamed of themselves charging so much for a basic dirty room and absolutely appalling breakfast service. Breakfast took over an hour to arrive it isasn order service and there is no buffet or any kind of self service bill did not arrive for another half an hour. Honestly in the US a hotel with these standards should go under administration. Dreadful. On my second day I was late waiting for a bill again and left without paying as no one paid any attention to me waiting with a credit card in hand for over 45 minutes. They chased me down the hallway and I then paid. Never againThe room charges for toiletries sitting on your table which you open not suspecting they are chargeable extras. Shower gel was 25 bucks. What a waste of money and how considerate. The food can not be called average breakfast was simply inedible greasy and very overpriced. I had to take an uber to go out for dinner in Chateau Marmont. 5 mins drive around the corner. One more thing. Noise was extremely loud as the wild nights with super loud dance music took place daily until 3 4am. I was on the upper floor and had a pillow on my head still hearing it very well. The visitors from other hotels came in to share the pool. I am disgusted to have wasted three days of my life on this place. Would never in my life visit it again.
