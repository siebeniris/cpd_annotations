My girlfriend and I stayed at this hotel for four days 0126 0129. Check in for our suite was fairly seamless. and the staff was helpful. Getting up to the room took a while because one of their elevators was temporarily disabled which seemed to happen around the same time everyday and the other two took forever going between the 30 floors. The first thing we noticed was that the room while clean looked nothing like the suite we booked online. The layout was entirely different and MUCH smaller the view nonexistent but that was expected and the furniture available was not what we expected based on the site. To make it worse no other suites were available. We were also greeted by the fabulous sounds of construction 15 ft outside our window 3 of the 4 days we were there Sunday being the exception. Hammering drilling saws you name it we heard it 6 am 5 pm all day. On top of that there was scaffolding on the other building that just so happened to be directly level with our room meaning they could and DID see clearly in our room everyday. My girlfriend got out the shower and two of the workers were standing at an opening in the building and we had to immediately close the curtains. This forced us to have to keep everything closed at all times but overall I guess that was not so bad since there were nothing but old rundown buildings to look at.

This hotel is very no frills but fulfilled the need for my boyfriend and I to have a place to stay at over the weekend. NYC does have its limitations with space so for a hotel in an old looking building I think this hotel does the best with what they have. I quickly realized this when our suite was only 52 sq ft with strategically placed furniture to maximize use of space. If you are upgraded to a suite as we were do not expect it to be much of an upgrade. The living area occupies one tiny corner with a corner couch not even long enough to lie down on. do not expect great views either we faced a run down abandoned building. that is NYC hotel life for ya. Cons. This is not the kind of hotel that is going to have a bathrobe and slippers in the closet or a stocked mini fridge. In fact we did not even get bottled water. According to the hotel pamphlet the tap water is filtered for you to drink. I prefer bottled water at hotels because I am skeptical about the cleanliness of the glasses so we had to go to Walgrens to buy a pack. Overall the decor is a little shabby. Our entryway light would not turn on. The maid service was lacking. They empty your trash and change the sheets and towels but they will not tidy up the place like most hotels will. All these things definitely were not the end of the world but also did not meet my expectations. Pros. The service was good. The breakfast buffet is decent. I liked the full size fridge for us to store leftovers. We did not need the kitchenette but it seemed nice. The water got warm quickly for showers.

The bed was super fluffy and they generously give you 5 long pillows. Their TV has all the channels you had like.

The bathroom was very clean and they provide a generous supply of shampoo conditioner and body wash. The lights in the bathroom mirror were gorgeous it made me feel like I am in a studio. The best feature of the room is the kitchen. YES A KITCHEN. The refrigerator was so clean and they even have an induction stove. Safe for children because if they accidentally touch the stove while you are heating something they will not feel anything Elements also provided the rooms with salt and pepper utensils plates bowls glasses and mugs. I do not even know what else to ask of them. Everything exceeded my expectations. Also the location was good. You can hail a cab anytime the uber has a spot where to stop and the subway is walkable. there is a Park place in front where you can get a discount. Just have your parking ticket stamped at the front desk. As for the staff everyone was friendly. We brought our two small dogs with us and they were allowed to walk in and out the hotel on a leash. The management does not require dogs to be put inside carriers which is very convenient for us because placing our babies in carriers is a hassle and it stresses the dogs out.

As a native New Yorker I returned back home to visit family and friends. Usually I stay in the heart of Times Square but this trip I wanted to be close enough to the heart but also feel like a native. Super satisfied that I chose the Element New York Times Square West. With the proximity to Times Square being just a few blocks away along with access to mostly every train you need makes the location a definite choice. When I arrived at the hotel I was greeted with a warm welcome and smiling faces. Flying in from LA and taking the red eye I knew that my room would not be ready right away. However LIz at the front desk was super accommodating and allowed me to change in their restroom got my bags checked for me and offered me breakfast in their dining area before I headed out to some morning meetings. Once my room was ready they notified me and I could not have been more pleased. The room was very spacious clean and eco friendly. I had a kitchenette with a really nice size refrigerator which allowed me to stock it with snacks and drinks for the 4 days I was going to be in town. Also loved the water filter that was hooked up to the faucet in the kitchenette area. Native New Yorkers love NYC water. The desk area was spacious and a perfect size for me to set up my laptop and mouse and take care of business without feeling smothered. The bedroom was separate from the living and kitchen space so it gives you are a really great feeling of a studio one bedroom apt that you would rent in NYC. Also the room had two televisions which made relaxing a lot more enjoyable one in the living room and the other in the bedroom. One of the best perks about staying at the hotel besides having a kitchenette that you can stock 7 11 is right across the street is the complimentary breakfast that they serve. Their complimentary continental breakfast is located on the lobby level and hits the spot. The selection is great as well from eggs and bacon to pancakes and french toast to bagels and cereral to yogurt oatmeal and muffins and not let us not forget the coffee tea and juice station. One of the staff members working the dining area named Juan Carlos was awesome as well. I woke up late one morning and arrived as they were breaking down the stations. He offered me take what was still available and went to the back to get me some milk for my cereal and coffee and invited me to sit and enjoy my breakfast while they broke down the stations. Thanks Juan Carlos. That coffee and bagel chased down by some Raisin Bran was priceless for me that morningOveral the staff was really friendly and made me feel welcome the whole four days I was in town. Steve the assistant manager was gracious and very accommodating and made himself available if I needed anything at all. I highly recommend this hotel to any local returning back home to visit family and friends business professionals that want to be close enough to Times Square but not bumping into tourists everywhere they go and any family that is looking for a great place and looking to save a few extra bucks by taking advantage of their complimentary breakfasts and kitchenettes.", "offset": [1541, 1668], "date": "2019-12-08", "cpt": "4", "category": "room"}, {"id": 35, "uid": "771fed19-9ace-4201-a26b-3ea02ea0f93e", "sentence": "The staff is nice but I just do n\u2019t like the size and comfort of the rooms.

The location is near Times Square so it is great for visiting Manhattan. However it is also in the heart of the city and there is little sound proofing there was near constant noise from sirens and honking. If you are a light sleeper you may want to choose another hotel. The rooms were fair and have a full sized fridge. The rooms were maintained ok the bed and kitchen seemed clean but there was a ring in the toilet and a lot of mildew spots around the top of the shower along with a broken handle in the shower. Water in the shower was either burning or luke warm. Housekeeping did not show up until 6 pm one day but then stopped by 3 times the next morning even though I was checking out that day. This was not a big deal to me as it was just me in the room so I had plenty of towels but be prepared that service may vary. The gym is in the basement and it is a decent size. There were not many people there during morning peak hours. The breakfast room is spacey but it does get crowded during the peak period from about 730 830. The food selection was quite good. As others have mentioned the elevators are a problem. I am not sure how long the third elevator will be shut down I visited in early January and it was still shut off. but you can easily wait 15 minutes for the elevator.
