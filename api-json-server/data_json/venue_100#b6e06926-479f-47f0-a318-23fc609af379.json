The front desk staff are pleasant and make quick work of thw registration and check out process. The rooms are nicely appointed and maid service is attentive. The walls seem very thin at times. Guests wandering the halls as they return after an evening can be heard walking and talking for quite a distance. I believe most rooms have a small refrigerator that easily holds soft drinks and small containers. This hotel is connected with the Monterey Conference Ctr. so it can be busy and often very full.

We stayed at the Portola for a conference in October and it is a lovely hotel. The service was exceptional both the general front of house housekeeping and the restaurant staff. We also had a private function in a meeting room with a catered lunch the AV was set up on time the room was fine the food was great and the staff were fantastic. The hotel is situated right near the Wharf in Monterey where all the touristy shops and restaurants are located. It is however a good 20 minute walk to Cannery Row the other touristy area with more restaurants and shops. The room itself was lovely done up in that wicker and wood beach house style you will find in parts of Florida and in California. I could head the sea lions barking at night from my hotel room and if you walk towards the water you may also spot a harbour seal. A lovely time in a lovely hotel.

I have never stayed at a hotel with such inconsiderate guests. If you are looking for the resort life with a good nights sleep this is not your place. This is a party hotel for conference attendees. Note also this hotel is not air conditioned. There are numerous terrible rooms at the lower levels overlooking busy roads or pedestrian areas where it would be impossible to leave your windows open on a hot summer night.

The Portola Hotel was our last 4 night stay during our 3 week USA trip and unfortunately also the least rewarding. This is a massive conference hotel with very little charm. The breakfast was very good and the highlight. The pool was ok just a bit strange one had to walk across a road to get to it. Everything else was pretty average. We had issues with our fan as it was making a lot of noise. Engineering did have a look at it in the evening promising they would have it fixed the following day. This did not happen. engineering actually only showed up whilst we were checking out. The promised FREE WIFI is only available in the corner by Jacks bar. parking charges are very over priced.

Last week I had the pleasure of staying a second time at the Portola Hotel Spa in Monterey Bay. At the check in you are greeted by friendly staff that truly seem to enjoy their job. Not only are they friendly but they offer you a delicious WARM Chocolate Chip Cookie. The beginning of a great stay. The rooms are clean and comfortable. Also I always leave the shampoo body wash and soaps at home to reduce the stress at customs and with TSA. The products provided at the Portola Hotel Spa are top quality and the scent is perfectly discreet. Nothing over powering just a hint of a natural scent. I am not a fan of perfume scents and these are just to my liking. The beds are comfortable always a favourite for me. If the bed is too hard or too soft I just do not sleep right. These beds are the picture of comfort. I melted into mine as soon as my head hit the pillow after a long day of travel. The staff are so friendly and down to earth. Each and everyone of them smiled and greeted me with a hello every time I saw them. The restrooms near the convention rooms were clean and tidy and I frequently saw staff either entering or exiting them with cleaning supplies. I just love their work ethic but that their focus is on the people they are serving not on the task at hand. Complete professionalism. The staff seem to like their jobs so much that they leave the impression that each one has a true share in the success of the establishment. This trip I took the time to take in a massage at the spa. TOTALLY WORTH IT. Do it do not delay. I loved it and was fully relaxed after a day of travel and 2 days of meetings. It was the cherry on the top of the ice cream.
