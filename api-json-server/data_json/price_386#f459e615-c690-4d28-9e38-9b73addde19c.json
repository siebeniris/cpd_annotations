Perhaps there are ghosts in the buildingAs I told myself as me and a friend stayed at the Historic Mayfair Hotel a 1926 hotel that retains its old look but inside things have been modernized. While we went to this hotel to commute to the Los Angeles Convention Center for E3 the price was fantastic and for the most part not often do I get a chance to stay in a hotel this old. While we were able to walk to restaurants which are not too far what kind of freaked me out were certain noises no I am not going to say this hotel is haunted. but suffice to say I went two days with not much sleep. Perhaps I was too paranoid or a bit creeped out but I was unable to sleep at all. Needless to say the room was adequate for two people and for its price during E3 it was hard to beat the price.
