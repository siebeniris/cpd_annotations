Just got back from staying 2 nights at the Ritz Carlton Berlin. Loved everything about this hotel. The rooms were amazing and the best of our trip to Germany. Bathroom floors had heated tile. Beds were large and comfortable. Everything was top notch. especially the staff and service that Ritz Carlton is known for. The location of this hotel can not be beat and we stopped back in for a respite a couple of times during the day while sightseeing. it was never far from where we were. It was also a peaceful haven from the hectic nature of visiting tourist sites. We enjoyed drinks both nights at the Curtain Club which had live music and was very enjoyable. We gave Fragrances a try too. Interesting concepts but not so much my thing the drinks taste like potpourri. Breakfast at the brasserie was amazing. Quite a spread. However dinner there was terrible. it was our worst meal in Germany on an 11 day trip. And it was also one of the more expensive ones too. I love French food but I highly recommend avoiding the restaurant other than breakfast. Overall we loved our stay here and would choose this hotel again without reservation.

We stayed in many other five stars hotels and somehow they manage to make you feel like you are the most important person there. Our room was amazing. We stayed in one of the bigger suites and you could not fault it. Bed was fantastic great night sleep and all the amenities you can think of provided. Disappointment came in the morning when we went for breakfast. The restaurant itself was not very pleasant. The tables were tiny and very close together. All time through the breakfast there was loud music being played and it was not classical or relaxing but current pop chart which is quite odd for 5 hotel. Buffet had a wide selection but everything hot was unbeatable. Bacon was so burned you could smell the cancer when you opened the tray. Scrambled egg was still sizzling. Everything was so dry and overcooked we actually found it funny that they thought it is acceptable to be served to people. We had few cocktails in the bar late in the evening.

Whenever I travel I either stay at boutique hotels or a Kampinsky but seeing the photos of this beautifully appointed place decided to fork out some extra money. I was also excited to be staying at such a world famous place as had never stayed in a Ritz before. The placement is ideal central and in Potsdamer Platz with S and U bahn lines right there. Also the Sony centre is a few metres away where you can go and have meals and even watch an OV movie in an IMAX. And its fabulous to have the Tiergarten just there a green lung in a city which does not feel polluted anyway. The hotel itself is beautiful without a doubt even their faux marble columns. The staff is very pleasant. And we were impressed by the size of our lovely room and its amenities. However I was taken aback at the fact that they charge and horendously for everything else including internet a basic of life nowadays at 595 \u20ac for an HOUR and 1995 \u20ac for the DAY. Unbelievable and outrageous and especially so in a city and country with rare free wifi some German law which holds the provider liable for its clients actions. Also at a steep 30\u20acbreakfast 60 \u20ac since we were two would have been 300 \u20ac for the 5 days we stayed to have what we have toast and coffee. Here is where we would pop off for breakfast and free wifi for half an hour to the Sony centre every day. The free TV channels are also pathetic either in German or Arabic a lot of the English american movies and series are dubbed with the English channels being mainly for news and plus because they want to make money from even this you can not even change the dubbed language to the original bah. They have a gym and a pool which is in the basement a very basic gym with a couple of running machines hello Tiergarten here I come some free weights a couple of bikes 2 ski Machines some weight machines a bench press and that s it.

Berlin is one of the most interesting cities in the world. It is modern friendly well planned and with so many things to do. Ritz Carlton Berlin possesses one of the best locations possible at this city Postdamer Platz. Old town is very close as Spree River the Zoo magnificent Branderburg Gate and some subway stops away Kunfusterdam. This city has many options to stay and in comparison with other European capitals also good prices are possible. Between the options we had we chose the hotel based on the excellent breakfast \u2019s fame the location and the price. We enjoyed our stay but it did not meet our expectations. Room is opulent but in decay. There should be better maintenance to avoid chipped furniture and wall marks. As we were travelling in a special occasion we found a bottle of sparkling wine only to find later they just took it from the minibar. We appreciate the detail but we notices how mechanically they sort out these things. Bed and linen were comfortable and the bathroom was clean. We did notice that they remove the telephone shower so using the tub can not be spontaneous. In general the bathroom is enjoyable. The problem came the day after the friendly with a terrible breakfast experience and uneven housekeeping. There is kind woman as hostess and she was consistently friendly. But after that service was terrible without dishes \u2019 replenishment or service to the table. It was Sunday at looked busier but that is not a pretext in a Five Star hotel. We complained that day and guest relations tried to reach us. However as we there to sightsee we never had the opportunity to meet. We had had problems at other hotels but they managed the situation better. Although they were nice it was inefficient. The Spa was also a letdown. The pool was too cool and the area was untidy. If you were there to swim it was difficult and even worse to relax. The tiles were rundown and separated from their place. We had a credit for food and drink so we decided to dine at the hotel one night. First we tried to go to Brasserie Desbroses were breakfast is served but it was so uninviting at evening. And in contrast to the breakfast there was no friendly hostess. So we decided to go curtain club. They have their own menu they can serve food from the restaurant and have fragrances cocktails. This was one of the highlights of our stay. Service was fantastic food was good and drinks were unique. Concierge was very good too. Everything but one event worked very well. This letdown was sending us into a restaurant without reservation and the place was full. All the rest was fine and the help was very professional.

We spent one night in this very high quality hotel in the middle of Berlin. The Hotel itself is great. Very beautiful rooms are spacious and gorgeous. The bed is extremely comfortable and you can pick which kind of pillow and pillow cover to get. But I guess this is sort of what you expect from a 5 stars hotel. We went to the spa as I was supposed to get a massage. The spa area is very nicely decorated the swimming pool is small but very beautiful. The gym as all the machines you need and there is a big option of sauna. The weird thing is that nobody welcomes you at the entrance of the spa. If you have questions or needs you have to call the concierge who is often busy and does not answer. In my case the masseuse did not show up on time. Another masseuse came but she was supposed to deal with another customer who did not show up either. 20 minutes later after calling and complaining to the concierge several times we realized my masseuse took her client who arrived extremely earlier. If we would not have called and called I would have just spend 1 hour waiting for my masseuse. In the end this other masseuse took care of me. Basically my massage was 30 minutes later. I know it is something which can happen but you really do not expect it from such an hotel. Especially nobody knew what happened to my masseuse and why was not she coming. The concierge did not apologize. When checking out we complained with the receptionist who had no idea which is also weird and she refunded us the full massage. It was totally unexpected and of course highly appreciated. Big plus for the Ritz Carlton. Here it comes the breakfast breakfast is not included in the rooms cost you pay it separately and it is totally not cheap. Nobody expects something cheap from the Ritz but its price is really high also compared to other hotels such as Sofitel. We got to breakfast where you have a huge selection of breads croissants jams juices eggs fruits cereals yogurts etc. Fact is that what make a 5 stars hotel a real 5 stars hotel are the details at least in my opinionCofe was terrible philadelphia was out of date and when we shows it to the waiter nobody bothered bringing us a fresh one glasses smelled of eggs baskets for bread and croissant does not have napkins and napkins are not available in the room.

In particular we were impressed by Jan in Guest Services who heard about a minor issue we had had with our shower earlier on. He offered a multitude of ways to make up for the inconvenience and went far out of his way to let us know that he had be happy to do whatever he could to help us. He was genuinely gracious and sincere. We were equally impressed by Maurice in in room dining. We had an early morning flight and needed breakfast by 530am typically the hotel starts full breakfast service at 60am. Noting our concern when we placed our order Maurice came to our room personally to assure us that everything would be perfect the next morning. Not only did breakfast arrive on time but it was spectacular. Along with our order Maurice included a variety of gourmet meats cheeses and condiments. Also included was a hand written thank you note from Jan Guest ServicesOveral this is a quality hotel with wonderful staff. Having said all of this if there is only one thing that we found a bit off it was an issue with the shower not working properly.
