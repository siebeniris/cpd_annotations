The recently renovated spa swimming pool and gym areas are definitely a highlight. The bedroom was clean spacious and really comfortable. The breakfast was amazing. The restaurant bistro and cafe also offer affordable options for guests even in such prime property. When you book a five star hotel you do not expect to find dirty and torn bathrobes in your room. We could have just ignored that but to access the spa and swimming pool area you need to wear one. When new bathrobes were requested I was asked to go downstairs to the reception as I had to show the bathrobes and justify why I needed clean and not damaged ones. After leaving the bathrobes in the reception a staff member came to the room and asked to see the ones we had. I explained to him that I left the bathrobes at the reception. I thought that was unnecessary as they could have just believed in me but I also thought well. maybe that s the German way of handling things. My surprise was to find out that they could not offer us two bathrobes for men because each room must have one bathrobe for a man and one bathrobe for a woman. Wi fi does not work well in the spa gym and swimming pool areas. The Hotel does not offer a shuttle service from to the closest train station K\u00f6nigswinter. If you do not have a car then the only way to go up and down the hill is by taxi or walking. 32 km 50 minutes walk. Please consider that while planning your trip.

The Steigenberger was freshly renovated in 2019 as we find with great success. The hotel interior is truly beautiful now. My favorite room is the lounge with the big fireplace where high tea is served on the weekend. The views of the Rhinevaley are great too. No other hotel in the Bonn region has a comparable location. The rooms are comfortable too. I would suggest asking for extra pillows for the bed though to give you a more comfortable sleep. You also need transport when you stay here because of where the hotel is situated. Breakfast is okay but the view from the breakfast room is great. The hotel feels understaffed for a 5 star hotel and not everyone is really service minded. So in short the hotel and the facilities are excellent the service leaves a lot to be desired though. I would rate the buildings rooms the amenities 5 star the service gets 3 stars maximum. The hotel is freshly opened so some of this might be due to the newness of the operation. Maybe everything will be up to expected 5 star standards in its due course. I do hope so because I come to this area a lot and would love a good hotel to stay in.
