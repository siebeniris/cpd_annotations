Restaurant They have a good menu on paper but only serve the basic dishes. chicken curries biryani dal etcthey only seem to care about customers who go for their buffet. The system of no alacarte for breakfast does not seem right. Your hotel is good and it deserves a good restaurant. PS It was a very good stay for us in Ginger no doubt about it. But as mentioned we really do not think 9AM in the morning is treated an early check in costing us an extra Rs 653. The restaurant is definitely something to be looked into. We stayed for 4 nights and had food at the restaurant only twice that too coz it was a bandh. We had to look out for other restaurants the other days. We would definitely opt for Ginger BBS.
