Stopped here for 4 nights after a cruise on MV Arcadia. The room was unexpectedly ready when we checked in at 1030am and that was a bonus. And the hotel is well placed for both Fishermans Wharf and Pier 39 The room was clean and ample in size although two three quarter beds would have been better with just one double. The bed however. was very comfortable and the room on the ground floor. next to the internal garden was quiet. Nice bathroom could just have done with a towel rail but that is no bigie. The only real disappointment was breakfast. I realise that US hotels do not often have a full BB service but we had breakfast here on our first morning I have to say it was rather underwhelming and the only meal we had in SF that was less than good. Other breakfastss were taken elsewhere.

The location is GREAT. walking distance to everything on the wharf and the cablecar line to get anywhere. HOWEVER it was grossly overpriced for what we got. The room was clean and comfortable but much smaller than we thought. We reserved two Queen beds and got 2 double beds maybe.

I am writing this review as an Event coordinator for a company. We opted to hold a 2day conference at this property with rooms included for our guest speakers and the results were very disappointing. One of our guests complained about loud neighbors and was not able to get any rest. Another guest found stained bed sheets upon his arrival which is completely unacceptable. They refunded us for our rooms but as a company we could not let our valued guests stay here so we had to move them to another hotel. As for the event we had prearranged all the details and necessities of our 2day conference and after party with the hotel banquet staff. It seemed that everything was all set and clear but on the day of our conference the event staff on site did not seem to know much about our set up and what we needed. I will start with Friday set up for our conference. We had some boxes shipped to this hotel for our event. We had requested a separate conference room in which these would be placed since we did not want them to be sent to our rooms. Sure enough 2 of the boxes were sent to our rooms and 5 were missing. The banquet manager that I was working with that day did not seem to know where our shipments were despite them having arrived 2 days earlier. She eventually found all of them but this was still very concerning. Saturday was Day 1 of our conference with an after party to be held later that night. We were working with several banquet managers a different one for each day and they did not seem to communicate well with each other. Things that I had already requested with one manager did not get passed on to the other it was a hassle to get everything done and in place. We were promised and paid for 3 hours of tech support for this weekend. They were no support at all. They had a very poor understanding of our set up despite previous discussions about it. We had an original contract with another tech company and when I called them to arrange our event he told me he was not working it any more. No one from the Sheraton communicated this to us I had to find out on my own. We paid for a service we did not receive we were not dealing with the promised person. instead the tech guy assigned to us was just one of Sheratons event staff. Furthermore we had over 200 guests attend this conference. We had water stations set up and requested them to be refilled whenever empty. But every time we ran out of water I constantly had to ask for refills even though I was assured that house keeping would take care of it. And every time I would ask the staff to refill the pitchers I was replied with You guys drink too much water. To make matters worse I booked a catered dinner through the Sheraton for 11 guests months in advance. It was absolutely awful we were embarrassed that our honored guests had to sit through this dinner. The soup was not hot and had a layer of skin over it as though it had been sitting out for hours. The main course was room temperature and none of our guests touched the dessert. Plus our waiter was rude. He kept banging plates around and setting the them down hard. He spoke to our guests very rudely when asking what they would like. One guest asked for a diet coke and was responded with no we can only give you iced tea. This was beyond unbelievable. Very poorly trained staff. We paid a handsome price for this dinner only to be treated with disrespect and served cold food. After dinner was our after party at the deck which was a small area across the hall of our conference room. We were promised that this party area would be \u201c closed off \u201d and it was not. The banquet manager told me that no one would interrupt us during the party that we had the whole area \u201c all to ourselves \u201d but families and kids from the pool would walk by. We bought 100 drink tickets at 10 each for this party and the bartender just packed up and left without announcing last call so we had drink tickets left over. Furthermore the event staff just turned off the lights to get all the guest to leave without warning. So there was 100 other unique individuals that witnessed the quality of the staff. Sunday was the last day of our conference the banquet manager was not present unles texted or called for. He was not present during our event although he was supposed to be. At the end of the event he was no where to be found and was out of reach. We emailed the general manager Michael Hirch of this hotel to voice our negative experience and to request compensation with no response. A week later one of the banquet managers that we had to deal with the during weekend emailed us back with a lack luster apology and a promise to re train staff and nothing morePlease accept my sincerest apologies for any oversight during the event on Saturday July 18th and Sunday July 19th. I have read through your letter and appreciate the thoroughness of your feedback. I will take the opportunity to use this information and implement additional training for my staff. While I understand there may have been miscomunications on both sides please know that the invaluable feedback from you and your staff will allow us the opportunity to improve the product and services that we offer here at the Sheraton Fisherman \u2019s Wharf. In short the lack of service and etiquette from this hotel left our company and guests very disappointed. It was truly embarrassing for both our company and the Sheraton Fishermans Wharf. We tried to work this problem out with them but they have left us no choice but to take this matter public. Our experience at this hotel and the way it is being handled is very unimpressive to say the least.", "offset": [3140, 3208], "date": "2015-07-30", "cpt": "0", "category": "general"}, {"id": 4, "uid": "97427709-5533-4be6-bdab-e4f5e2ab7e86", "sentence": "Nice hotel Close to fisherman wharf.

Great location. Check in and staff were great but all downhill after that. Our room was a deluxe room with 2 doubles. Beds were an absolute abomination. Pillows were awful according to my husband and kid. I always bring my own pillow. I have never awoke from sleeping on a bed with so many aches and pains in my life. Took forever to even fall asleep. The air conditioner kept going on and off all night. Something wrong with the sensor would get too hot then freezing. Traffic noise all night in our room. The bathroom is so small they have to alter the toilet paper roll to make it fit and when you sit on the toilet you ca nt even shut the door. The shower head is for people who are on the short side if you are tall forget it you have to kneel down to get underneath the shower head. Stains on the ceiling could not identify not water stains either. Shower was filthy room was spot cleaned from previous guests. The walls and ceilings are thin so you are aware of the hotels other guests. And last but not least the 560 a night charge for parking which is ridiculous when there is a garage right across the street for 350 which they do not tell you. The amenities are also awful shampoo etc. I Have stayed at other hotel chains with 2 and 3 stars that were off the charts better in the same area.

We stayed here for a night for a quick 2 day one night trip to SF. Thank god it was only one night I do not think I could stand to stay there more that that. I am not hard to please give me a clean room and a comfy bed and I am happy. Check in there was about a 10 minute wait upon arrival which was no big deal. There was only one person at the front desk and he was quite cheerful and obviously doing the best he could. He asked if we preferred a king or a 2 bed room. With 4 people we opted for two beds. We were notified that parking was 70 PER NIGHT after taxes. Insane. Especially for a hotel that also charges for internet and has no sort of breakfast included. The room. Initially when we walked in the room I was pleased it seemed clean and was a decent room with a nice desk area a big window and a accent chair. Unfortunately it was less than clean the desk had crumbs from the pervious person hair everywhere and stuff all over the floor obviously not vacuumed well if at all. The beds I do not know what the other are talking about in their other reviews about great beds and pillows. I have never been so uncomfortable in my life. We hardly slept. The 2 beds were not queen as you had expect they were full beds yikes. if even that. The mattresses were rock hard and you could feel the springs digging into you as you moved. The pillows had two options lumpy and firm or so soft you have to fold it over twice for some substance.
