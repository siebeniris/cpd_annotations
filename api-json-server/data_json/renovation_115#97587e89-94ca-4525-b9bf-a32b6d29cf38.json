The location was okay however not really in walking distance to anything. There were a fair amount of amenities within driving distance and close to a Panera Breads our favourite breakfast lunch location. The hotel is a bit outdated. When I booked it I was certain it stated the rooms had been renovated but they are looking worn and do not look as good in person as they do in pictures. The bed was comfortable and the room was spacious. This hotel is full of families which we did not mind as we have older kids at home. Pool was really great and the service at the pool also good. We got a fantastic rate through west jet vacations so I really can not complain about price for value. Would I stay here again. I would likely find another hotel to try as this one was nothing to write home about.", "offset": [312, 465], "date": "2015-07-07", "cpt": "0", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "cc12aa2b-a0cb-438c-8581-883f81bd2f33", "sentence": "Excellent.

I totally agree with another reviewer regarding the screaming cheerleaders running rampant through this hotel. This was our first time at this Mariot but we have previously stayed at the Palm Desert Mariot during the summer and have had this same problem. If you are going to have groups like this keep them in a separate section of the hotel away from the other guests. I do not appreciate paying 160 for a room and then having to listen to screaming girls slamming doors and running through the corridors at all hours. I also got slammed into when walking down the hallway by two girls who were racing. You would be better off staying at one of the casino hotels where they do not have teeny boper cheerleader camps. Some other issues were with cleanliness and maintenance. We also noticed that after the screaming memies had meals in their rooms they would leave their dirty dishes out in the hallway some still half full of food. These plates from dinner were still stacked in the hallways the next day. Really. How disgusting. How can that not be noticed by hotel personnel when you deliver newspapers to the rooms each morning. You can not tell me that does not attract rats and bugs. We also had a problem with our shower. It was a shower tub combo. The shower head worked great but the drain would quickly back up and you would end up standing in ankle deep water by the end of your shower. I called the front desk and they said they would have maintenance come right away but they never did. I left another message but still no response. I do not know about you but I would not put up with that at my house I would have it fixed and not ignore it. I really wanted to like this hotel. The property is lovely and the pool area is very nice. There was also an aerospace meeting going on when we were there so the bar area tended to get a little busy at night but the staff there was very good and handled the crowd well order the date pistachio cookies. We also had lunch at Cava restaurant which was quiet and the service was good. Our only saving grace was that we booked a larger corner room so we were not exactly in the middle of the cheerleader fray but still close enough to be annoyed and disappointed.", "offset": [1451, 1552], "date": "2017-06-30", "cpt": "0", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 4, "uid": "2175f994-ecfc-4d51-a52d-e81c3443d596", "sentence": "Almost perfect. We took my parents to this resort for a little vacation. The overall hotel and grounds are beautiful. The lobby atrium and lounge put you in the perfect mood for a relaxing get away. We had adjoining rooms as requested. They were very large and nicely appointed. What a nice surprise to have a bathroom with double sinks and a private room for the commode. Although the pool was huge and even has a sandy beach it needs refurbishing. There are many areas of peeling and flakey paint in the pool. There are plenty of lounge chairs tables and umbrellas. We ate dinner at the Cava restaurant because it had the most varied menu. The place could use an update. The seats were dirty from previous customers. The seafood buffet was great. The braised beef was disappointing. No matter where we were the staff was exceptional attentive and very friendly. Overall we had a very nice and relaxing weekend.
