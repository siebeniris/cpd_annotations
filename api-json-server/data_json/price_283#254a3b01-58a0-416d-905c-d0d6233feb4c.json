Stayed here last year as a birthday treat and I was left so disappointed mainly by the food and the customer service. As it was booked as a surprise I had no treatments booked in the spa so I rang down on arrival and was told everything was booked out and you should really book in advance. ok fair enough. We then had dinner in the restaurant and found the menu to be very limited and the food pretentious. The meal was poor at best portion sizes were incredibly small starter was comprised mainly of parmesan shavings flower petals and dots of sauce nothing was very tasty. I ordered the beef for mains and requested it be medium well and it came out very very rare I asked the waitress was it possible to have it cooked more as I had ordered medium well she came back with it two minutes later and it was the exact same. My partner ordered chicken which he said was quite average for the price. Breakfast was also disappointing limited choice and what you would expect of an average 3 star hotel. I ordered a fried egg and I was left sitting for 20 mins in which time my partner had finished his breakfast. Eventually the waitress came back with two incinerated fried eggs both of which were full of shell. This place is not cheap so I was incredibly underwhelmed that this was the calibre of service on offer. We then decided not to hang around and to check out immediately following breakfast. At the desk when asked how our stay was I raised our disappointment we were then referred to a manager who apologised and offered us a voucher to return at some point she took our details and said she would be in touch. To this day I have never had any correspondence from the hotel which frankly I find insulting. I found customer service to be incredibly poor and I will not be returning. There is nothing worse than spending an exorbitant amount of cash for a disappointing stay.

I have stayed at Carton House several times and each time the place seems to have grown increasingly sadder and neglected. The grounds are as they have always been absolutely beautiful and well maintained but the hotel itself could do with some work. My room in the main house was comfortable but the furniture had seen better days as had the bathroom. There was some sort of function in the main house and the noise from the DJ was quite loud in our room thankfully the function did n\u2019t go on too late. The spa is beautiful but the leisure facilities would benefit greatly from some general maintenance there was a lot of water lying on the ground \u2013 in the sauna the steam room around the jacuzi \u2013 and the shower area in the men \u2019s changing room as well as the steam room stank of stagnant water everything just seemed a bit tired and badly maintained. Service also seems to have suffered. The check in staff are wonderful \u2013 very friendly and proficient \u2013 as are the girls in the spa. The waiting staff in the lobby bar were terrible I had to ask for my bill several times and the waiter who brought our food actually had no idea what he was serving. The restaurants at Carton also should make more of an effort to cater for vegetarians we went to the club house because we wanted an informal dinner but because it was steak night there was no vegetarian dish the waiter offered us by way of compromise chicken curry without the chicken which really is not good enough we ended up dining in Maynoth. The following afternoon we decided to have a light lunch in the beautiful lobby but the only vegetarian main a tomato and mozzarella tart was unavailable for whatever reason. Breakfast was a chaotic experience there was no one to meet and greet or to explain that breakfast was a \u201c sit wherever you want \u201d experience this has changed from my last visit. I selected a table went to help myself to the breakfast buffet and returned to find another couple seated there. The grounds as I said are beautiful and the golf course immaculately maintained. I went for a walk to the Tyrconel Tower \u2013 the tower used in the Carton logo \u2013 and was alarmed to find it bricked up and serving no purpose whatsoever. I then walked to the beautiful shell cottage \u2013 onetime home of Mariane Faithful \u2013 and it was n\u2019t in much better condition I even found a window that had been repaired using a flimsy piece of acetate. I do n\u2019t understand how these beautiful building \u2013 real assets of the Carton demesne \u2013 can be so neglected and under utilised I myself would pay a premium to stay in either of these gems. The main house also looks a bit sad the shelves in the library are empty and stacked on top of one another a small electric radiator sitting in an alcove once brimming with book the reception rooms cheaply and sparsely furnished. All in all my trip to Carton was n\u2019t dreadful it was n\u2019t however the five star experience I was expecting. There seems to be some real maintenance issues and the attention to detail that Carton prided itself on has like the Celtic Tiger long gone.", "offset": [2448, 2635], "date": "2015-06-08", "cpt": "0", "category": "price"}, {"id": 2, "uid": "776ef09d-5a51-4d51-95f9-c750723990b6", "sentence": "Disappointing.

While I was visiting Maynoth with a friend we decided to visit Carton House for a quick lunch as it has a great reputation and is known nationwide. On visiting the hotel you can not argue with its beautiful surroundings on the approach to the hotel or with the building and features on the estate itself. However we went to the The Kitchen Bar to grab some soup and sides. We sat down at approximately 150 and had placed our order by 1505. Our waitress noted that our food would be out soon. I had started to become annoyed before the food was served and was about to call over a manager just when the food arrived at our table. The waitresses version of soon was almost 40 minutes later now I am not putting blame on the waiter here on this occasion as the delay may have been caused in the kitchen. I put behind me the fact that we waited so long for just some soup and a side to enjoy it. Unfortunately I could not enjoy the food as the bread rolls were rock solid inside and out. It seemed as if the rolls had gone off and that the chefs had chanced their arms microwaving them. I informed a senior waiter who appeared to be the manager. He apologised and said he would get us fresh bread. I waited 5 minutes soup getting cold before he returned. He explained that there were no more rolls left and that he had wheaten brown bread toasted as an alternative. That was fair enough and I extended my thanks to him as I would never complain in a restaurant. The chips were lovely and the soup which was not a small portion was gorgeous. Expensive maybe but for a 5 star renowned hotel and luxurious surroundings surely it was worth itUnfortunately the last straw came at 1558 when we asked for the bill from the initial waitress. We asked should we go to the till but she insisted she would bring it to us. By 1606 we still had not received the bill and we observed the same waitress bringing drinks and serving food to other tables. This is when we got up and went to the till ourselves. When we got to the till to pay by card the young man did not key in the amount owed when he passed the keypad for us to enter our card pin therefore allowing us to type in our pin and hand him back the device. This was a genuine mistake yes but at this stage the whole thing was comical and completely unexpected in a 5 star hotel. All in all in awful experience. In all my time I have only complained a handful of times but I left this place in a bad mood not what you expect of a hotel of this stature which is a pity. I have not given a totally negative rating as apart from the bread the food was tasty and obviously the surroundings are magnificent. However it is clear that my rating is solely down to the poor slow unhelpful service at the Kitchen Bar. I can see that the majority of the reviews here are positive so maybe we hit a bad day.

We looked forward to one night away from the children and there was something romantic about staying in a former 18th century mansion. The driveway off the main road is about a mile or so and the view of the house on approach is absolutely stunning. We got to reception and it had the feel of being rather 5star staf were polite well groomed and very helpful. So far so good. We made a point of reserving a room in the original house and we were happy to pay extra for a piece of old world charm. However we were quietly disappointed by the ultra modern furnishings and asked if another room was available. We were told that they are pretty much the same we were very disappointed. Anyway we went for pre dinner drinks and were directed to the Kitchen Bar. Now this is just a matter of opinion but in terms of furnishings we found it rather vulgar. It retains many features of the original kitchen but they have tried to blend it with ultra modern furnishings which arguably does not work. Dinner was in the modern part of the hotel and was fine though not exceptional. The next day we decided to linger just a little longer and took a walk around the estate. We explored some of the ground floor in the old house and were pleasantly surprised to see lots of historic detail and original furnishings. would not it be great if we could have a light lunch or afternoon tea here. Alas when we enquired we were advised that we could sit in the Kitchen Bar or the rather plain atrium near the reception area.
