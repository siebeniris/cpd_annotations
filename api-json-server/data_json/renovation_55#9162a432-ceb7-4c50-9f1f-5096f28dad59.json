This hotel was a great location if you are in town for the theater easy walking blocks to all the Broadway theaters. We stayed for one night our room was ready early so we could check in and drop our belongings even if the room was not ready we could have drop our belongings off with the bell hop. The room was clean comfortable and modern. I am a stickler for clean bathrooms and this one was very clean large and modern. We joined their club and received a 15 tab which was nice. The staff were courteous. There was a wine hour we did miss it. It was literally one hour we got there as they were cleaning upI guess if you are giving away free wine you have to be conscientious of how much you give away. The restaurant attached was very good usual American restaurant fare but with unique twist ie we had sliders but with kobe beef fries but with truffle oil and parmesan cheese fried shrimp but with an Asian fusion sauce for dipping and a ches e and meat tray all very tasty. The gym had updated and in good condition equipment. There were free disposable ear phones available for the tv radio connected to each piece of exercise equipment. Great hotel.

The Muse is a beautiful boutique hotel 12 a block from Times Square. The decor is stylish and funky and it is very very clean. Everything was brand new due to recent renovations. When I was booking my room I could not decide between the Regular King Room and the Premiere Corner King. I called the hotel and spoke to Esprit. She helped me pick the perfect room and sent me some restaurant recommendations. I had shared with her that I was bringing my husband to NYC for his birthday and that we were also celebrating our 15th wedding anniversary. We were traveling with another couple which were also celebrating an anniversary. When we checked in Esprit had upgraded us both to suites. We were so excited. The suite was beautiful and huge. There really is not anything not to like at The Muse. All of the employees we encountered were professional and helpful. The decor is trendy and unique. I especially liked the lighting on the sides of the bed and on the bathroom mirror. The beds are comfortable. The rooms are spacious. The shower is amazing. Every space I saw in our room and in public domains like lobby restrooms were spotless. They offered free wine daily 5 6pm and coffee tea in the morning.

I have been staying at a few Kimpton Hotels around the US and I have to say that The Muse has been the best experience so far. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful. Check in and out was a breeze. They had all the right information and I got my keys in under 10 minutes. Housekeeping was prompt and quick when I asked for extra amenities and my room was always thoroughly cleaned by noon. In fact I would like to commend housekeeping for being very thorough when cleaning the room as it was wonderful to return to a spotless room after walking all over the city. The location of the hotel was excellent especially if you are headed to the theater district. You step out of the hotel turn to your left and you are smack in the thick of Times Square. I could see the giant billboards with colorful images from my room. I was wary of this checking into the hotel as I was worried about the crowds and noise. But to my absolute surprise the room was quiet I faced the back and the area around the hotel felt safe and secure. Most mornings I headed out to my right and I was immediately on Avenue of Americas with more space t breathe. Indeed there was nothing to worry about and I found the location perfect to go explore New York. The hotel was near everything. This is a boutique hotel with a small number of rooms and compact public space. So do not expect a sprawling hotel with cafes and tour desks in the lobby. The lobby is small with a few lounge chairs for guests to rest awhile. There is the front desk counter and a side area for when they will serve free coffee in the morning and wine for tasting in the evenings. This was the only drawback in my view. As the space is small there is not any place to lounge and have that glass of wine. It gets a little cramped quite quickly and I do not think I was there when the hotel was full. They provide coffee in the lobby in the morning so there is not a coffee machine in the room. This can be inconvenient if you need that coffee fix first thing in the morning. But I suppose you can grab coffee on the way out. The room was lovely. I had a corner room so there was ample space. Bed was super comfortable and they had night and day curtains so all light important when you have giant billboards lighted up throughout the night can be blocked out. The bathroom is large and NEW they recently renovated the rooms. This can be quire rare in New York so I really appreciated this. Beautiful tiles and clean lines I really loved it. I have to say that the room was probably the best I ve stayed in for New York and for a Kimpton Hotel. It was a mixture of the cleanliness great design and ample space that made the room so great. Overall The Muse is a great hotel. I had my reservations before I arrived including my worries about the location and noise level. I had also experienced some not so great Kimpton properties elsewhere and was therefore worried about the overall quality. So I was very impressed at what The Muse offered. The staff were great attentive when they saw that you needed help but otherwise not intrusive. They were always willing to help. The location is excellent. The rooms were amazing clean spacious comfortable and NEW.", "offset": [2347, 2411], "date": "2016-09-18", "cpt": "0", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 6, "uid": "75f635f5-fd45-4e15-9960-135617f5688c", "sentence": "Amazing Stay. I have been a fan of Kimpton hotels for many years. I have stayed in many across the country. So it was with a certain level of confidence that I booked the Muse in NYC. Their rates are very reasonable compared to other quality hotels and they give you so much more. There is always free wine in the late afternoon. Free newspapers. And always great service The location is perfect if you are going to be spending some time in the Times Square area. The hotel lobby is very small but the front desk staff was off the charts wonderful. Our room was not ready so they took our luggage while we walked one block to our theater. I had mentioned it was my birthday and when we got to our room there was champagne and cupcakes waiting including a handwritten note from the front desk staff. They even gave us a free breakfast in their lovely restaurant. Our hotel room was wonderful a little small by Kimpton standards but that is expected in NYC. The room was newly renovated and spotless.

From the moment we arrived in front of the Kimpton Muse the experience seemed too good to be true. But it was not. From the moment we arrived to the moment we drove away this hotel was perfect in every way. We arrived on a Saturday morning during a snowstorm that took NYC a bit by surprise. Before we got into the city we asked the Kimpton about early check in before noon and were graciously accommodated. We asked about parking and were told to simply pull up in front of the hotel and the staff would take care of us. As the snow fell all of this seemed too good to be true but it was not. We pulled our car up in front of the hotel in the busy Time Square district gave our keys to the valet and entered the modern lobby without issue. Despite the front desk being overrun with requests from panicked travelers whose flights had been changed or cancelled we were blissfully sent to our room within 10 minutes. The hotel has clearly been newly renovated and is immaculate. There is not anything out of place from lobby to elevator to room. We were amazed at how spacious our room was for NYC and the modern amenities abounded. Robes yoga mat and umbrella in the closet. Easy chair next to the Queen bed. Reading lamps in the headboard. Outlets and plugs for phones and devices near each nightstand. Mini fridge and safe. Beautiful walk in tiled shower. Surely there is also a flat screen tv but when in NYC who is watching tv. The room was beautifully appointed and again perfect. What struck us most about the room was its solitude. We did not hear any other guest noise street noise again it was blissful. There are many unexpected touches at the Kimpton Muse including a rotating plethora of treats in the lobby throughout the day. Hot chocolate bar in the afternoon wine in the evening and beverages in the morning. On the morning of our departure we checked out and asked for our car. A bellman checked in with us multiple times to make sure that we were being helped and checked that our car was indeed en route. This is a level of service not always expected in NYC. in a town that may not depend on repeat customers it is evident that the Kimpton Muse does and we will surely return. As we pulled away from this quaint hotel in the middle of the busiest part of NYC we no longer wondered if the Kimpton Muse was too good to be true. because it proved to us time and time again that it is perfect in every way.", "offset": [937, 998], "date": "2017-01-08", "cpt": "0", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 8, "uid": "6efed437-f8b0-4673-babd-52f06be9378b", "sentence": "Great Experience.

Looking around for an ash tray I we were inadvertently set up with a smoking room. So we went back down to change rooms only to come to find that Kimpton Muse is a non smoking property. Seems apparent that guests are smoking on this non smoking property. Fortunately Angel set us up with early check in for another room but the room was not ready so we set out in our tired state to get some breakfast. When we got the call at noon we came back to set our luggage in the new unit 410.
