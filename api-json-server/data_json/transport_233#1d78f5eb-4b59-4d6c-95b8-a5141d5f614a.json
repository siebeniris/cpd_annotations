From the moment we walked in the staff was inviting and engaging. We received a room on the 36th floor that had a wonderful view. The room was fantastic plenty of room for our family of four the full fridge was amazing for keeping water and snacks cold. On the 40th floor they had a rooftop deck which we thought would be jammed pack lucky for us it was not. do yourself a favor grab a drink and head to the 40th floor. The breakfast offerings were wonderful breakfast sandwiches cereal yogurt bagels donuts and more and it is included which will save you especially in NYC. The biggest surprise was their happy hour the beer they offered was better than average and they had soda and smoothies for our kids. The amount of food offered was amazing we ended up not going to dinner that night but simply getting pizza by the slice at Big Bros pizza a block down yummy pizza and super cheap. Shout outs to the 2 women working check in on Sunday June 7th around 10am. and to Jason who helped store our luggage on both ends of the trip. Great rooms location and staff.

Recently returned from a 1 night stay. Most of the reviews mentioned delays when waiting for lifts and I was a bit concerned because we were travelling with a lot of luggage but there were no problems at all. The room was large with a kitchen area and a lovely bathroom. Happy hour lasted from 530 until 7 pm Mon Thurs I think and during this time drinks including beer and wine and hot and cold snacks are served so this hotel would be great for families. Yes it was quite busy at breakfast but people are coming and going all the time so did not have to wait to get a table there was cereals fresh fruit bagels scrambled eggs fried potato omelettes muffins doughnuts yoghurts and more. Not great but definitely something for everyone and something not offered by many NY Hotels. Excellent free wifi.

I chose the element based on the price and proximity to Madison Square Garden. Of course I read many reviews as well. My husband nor I had absolutely any complaints about our experience with this hotel. Sure there were a few small cosmetic flaws within the room and the rooms are not huge but a very nice size for New York City. Having a full kitchen was wonderful and the breakfast was more than most establishments provide. When we arrived we got to choose the type of room that we wanted and requested a room on the second floor in order to avoid the long wait for the elevators. That is the only complaint that I had read repeatedly on Tripadvisor prior to booking our room and I want to say that they were extremely nice at the front desk and more than happy to put us on a level that was one short flight up from the breakfast room. The location is incredibly convenient to almost every tourist destination in Manhattan. That said it is a very crowded busy part of the city which is usually not our style but again we were seeing four nights of concerts at Madison Square Garden and wanted to be within walking distance. I would not recommend this location to folks who do not like crowds or preferred to be off the beaten path.", "offset": [869, 956], "date": "2016-01-28", "cpt": "0", "category": "transport"}, {"id": 8, "uid": "e5d93b09-f653-4dcb-a975-681820922286", "sentence": "Those lifts. Ok so lets get straight to the point on what seems to be the biggest issue in these reviews. The lifts. What can I say other than some people must be really impatient. At no point in the 4 nights I spent at this hotel did I have an issue. We were on 23rd floor so bang in the middle. On more than 1 occasion we turned up and pushed the call button and the lift was already at the correct floor and the longest we waited would have been no more than 2 3 mins at a push. Even at peak times such as breakfast. I also fail to see why anyone would let such a trivial thing spoil their holiday stay. The rooms are a decent size for a New York hotel. Full kitchen facility as well so if you wanted to make your trip self catered then you could. We even had a view of the Empire State which was nice there is also a roof terrace with a decent view of the city which we went up to a couple of times would be even better in the summer. Staff at the hotel are all great and do not seem to accept tips. We needed to call an engineer up as my other half had broke the safe. He was there within 10 mins and solved the problem straight away. He even waited to be invited into the room which I think shows a great level of customer service. I tried to tip him but he would not accept. I also seen other staff such as the porters refuse tips. There is always someone at reception counter and a member of staff to greet you back or wish you a good day as you leave. Breakfast is good. Basic but it will give you enough option to leave the hotel with filled up till lunch and will save you around 20 30 per person eating in rather than finding something out for breakfast. We did not experience any issues with it being too busy or overcrowded. We always got a seat however we did notice is was busier after 9 am. Overall I can not fault this hotel. The location is great. Walking distance from 42nd street train bus station and also Penn Station down at 34th. Also there is usually plenty taxis outside 42nd which is just around the corner. There is a couple of Irish pubs on your doorstep. Hells kitchen nearby. A short walk up to the hustle and bustle of the Times Square area.

Shame about the lifts. We were very excited about our stay at Element partly because of the location and partly because a friend of a friend said it was the best hotel they had ever stayed in. While we certainly could not say the same we were perfectly happy with our stay at the hotel. Our room was well sized modern and clean and although we did not make much use of the kitchenette I can see how it would be handy for breakfast as finding a seat in the small restaurant was not easy. The bed was also large and very comfortable. It would have been nice to have a better view which we requested but appreciate we had have had to pay a little extra for this so it was not a big isuewe had probably have given the hotel five stars if it was not for the lifts which are mentioned in a number of reviews on here and were incredibly frustrating. The addition of one more lift would probably solve the issues and perhaps this will happen as part of the renovations. However we regularly had to wait more than five minutes for a lift down from the 16th floor and almost missed breakfast on the last day after waiting a full 15 minutes. Otherwise we had have no hesitation in staying at the hotel again.

Also you have to wait a long time for the lift in the morning and evening.

I stayed 3 nights and complained about my AC that was making really LOUD and weird noises. I asked that if it was not fixed that they please change is into a different room. They told me they were going to fix it. The second night sale thing happened. I asked again for help in reception. They fixed it again. But at the end we had to turn off the AC for the next 2 nights and endure the heat. Terrible. Three sleepless nights when all you need to do is rest during holidays.
