Despite being our expedia reservation credit card that belongs to my husband a trip which he did not attend. she said she could not accept the card. Expedia was nice enough to cancel reservations but that did not come without a headache. Expedia said that in order to cancel reservation then they would have to speak with a hotel rep. The lady at the front desk told us the only way to contact a hotel rep regarding a cancellation was to email their reservations department. Expedia and us waited for an hour and five minutes without a response from the hotel regarding the cancelation. Expedia finally made something happen and cancelled the reservation with the refund for the hotel portion. The Clinton did not have great reviews to begin with.
