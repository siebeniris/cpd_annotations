Our stay was exactly what you would expect from the Ritz and what they always deliver excellence all the way. The room was large beautiful comfortable and well appointed. We were upgraded to a view of Central Park which was nice. The bathroom was very nice as it had separate tub and shower and products I would use other than at a hotel. There was only 1 sink in our room but the vanity was large enough for 2 and there was storage for my toiletries which is always appreciated. Admittedly I am a bathroom snob and this one I liked. The super comfy bed with luxury linens was hard to leave in the morning. This property is unusually quiet. We never heard hallway noise not even the slamming doors you usually get in hotels. If you hear anything from the street your window is open. Yes that happened to us and you can hear traffic 10 stories up. Of course the excellent service is what sets the Ritz apart. We came back from a theatre performance to find the soundtrack and a nice note from the guest services gentleman that had greeted us on day one. How he remembered we were seeing that show on that evening is beyond me. As we checked out the desk clerk asked me how I liked a different show we had seen. Mind you we bought the tickets ourselves not through the hotel. The concierge delivered spot on recommendations for lunch and dinner and gave helpful hints on getting around during the cold and snow. Everyone called us by name making us feel as though we were the only people in the hotel. The proximity to Central Park across the street shopping theatre and restaurants makes this one of our favorite places to stay in NYC. There is a small but very nice spa at the hotel. I enjoyed an excellent deep tissue massage that worked out the kinks from flying.", "offset": [1662, 1710], "date": "2015-02-08", "cpt": "0", "category": "fitness"}, {"id": 3, "uid": "6cf6028c-3a72-4d1e-a5bf-ad00386d1219", "sentence": "Very good with a few flaws. Stayed here for a couple of nights pre Christmas. Great location on South Central Park. Generous sized room and bathroom but no view. I paid using Mariot points and cash and had selected the lowest tiered room. Used the spa which was nice. The gym was very small and does not seem like it was custom designed more that it was the only available space to put the gym equipment. It is an L shaped room and not very wide so not a lot of space. Had afternoon tea there also and was disappointed in the service. Whilst the food was good they kept the tea pots off the table as they want to pour it themselves. that is fair enough but they really ought to be faster. I was finishing courses with an empty cup sitting in front of me. First world problems I know but the service just was not right. My other complaint also involves tea. There was no teamaking facility in the room there was for coffee. and so I asked for boiling water and a tea bag. They brought it alright but it was accompanied with a 12 charge. That one really annoyed me. 12 for boiling water and a teabag just is not right especially when you consider what the hotel costs. Staff overall were great. Door staff were especially helpful and courteous. Pre Christmas there was warm apple cider and cookies in the reception which were a great way to warm up when returning to the hotelit is a classic hotel and I would stay here again despite the minor flaws I have pointed out.", "offset": [268, 404], "date": "2015-04-27", "cpt": "0", "category": "fitness"}, {"id": 4, "uid": "88f46553-7c1c-4d06-91e8-4a59fed9efcc", "sentence": "Disappointed in our room. I booked into the deluxe club room and with my gold status I had hoped for an upgrade. I did not get an upgrade which is the risk you take. The only issue I have is that the view 2 windows to a central roof exhaust area was simply disgusting. I wish I had known just how bad the view was so I could have reserved for at least a city view but it was too late none available. Word of warning these rooms are not worth the rate. Pros. Great location easy access to Central Park and subway. Bed was comfortable room was clean great housekeeping service although there is not a nespreso machine in the room and the club only has coffee for the breakfast service otherwise you have to ask for a coffee. Good size room 425 sqft and bathroom was large with separate tub shower and great amenities water pressure was ok. Offer afternoon tea in the club and it was lovely great English scones with clotted cream. The fitness center was clean and had what I needed for my workout. The staff was friendly. No problems with wifi but I am not a huge user during vacation. Cons Club The food presentations in the club were the same for all three days that we were there. They only have wine water soda and tea out for self pour otherwise you have to ask one of the attendants for any other drink including a cordial or coffee after dinner. Worst Ritz Club candy cart ever. We had to haul our luggage through the two entry doors which are heavy glass no bellman in site. No pool and one steam room in the spa. The relaxation room is immediately outside of the treatment rooms so it could be a little awkward going in out or possibly noisy if a couple chatty ladies are waiting. Our dinner at Auden Bistro was meh the sushi flatbread was good but the monkfish was a bit tough and really tasteless. I do not know this for sure but I am guessing that they are preparing for a renovation in the very near future. You get the feeling that they are just trying to get by with what they have and will not go out of their way to improve what is currently available. They may be a little under staffed. If you desire to have a luxury stay near Central Park I would have to recommend Mandarin Oriental at this time even though I am a RC fan.

I generally like the Ritz Carlton as they usually have found a way to delight us. This time they did manage to get us a table at Ralph Laurens Polo Bar which is not easy. This particular property has been high on my list as it is located next to the Central Park and views from the Park View rooms are simply amazing. Otherwise this location has started to deliver mixed service standards mainly in Food Beverage Area. I always stay at the club level and I found that the service level had really dropped drastically since my last visit few years ago. The presentations during cocktail hours were very poor from variety perspective and the breakfast was kind of disappointing as well. Lunch and Afternoon tea service was pretty nice. We also tried the room service once and the food was less then innovative. In the lounge the staff was not very proactive for example they did not ask during the breakfast if we would like to have cappuccino and during the cocktail hours guest had to go to the kitchen to ask if they could have a drink as the staff was not managing the tables. Generally only the person at the concierge desk said something to us. Others did seem pretty much tuned out. Usually the Ritz have had employees at the main doors in uniforms to greet guests when they leave and return to the property. This time they did not have them there. Few times some employees without uniform were opening the doors and I was not really sure if they worked there or not. Few times we sat down in the lobby bar and there were people working behind the bar but nobody came over to us to ask if we wanted to have a drink or something. It pretty much seemed that they did not have proper amount of staff in duty during the evenings. Overall it looks like attention to detail mainly at the Club Lounges is something that some Ritz Carlton hotels like this one have started to fall behind and sometimes for this reason the better choice from price to service ratio perspective could be to stay in other Mariot brand hotels like the Edition or JW Mariot or maybe even outside the family in the Peninsula or the Four Seasons.

The Ritz Carlton Central Park South is a beautiful property. The staff was solicitous. We did not feel like we were in a big anonymous hotel but rather an intimate luxury inn. We were greeted by name as we came and went. The front desk staff was acomodating to our needs and the concierges were helpful. Quite a professional staff. The gym is functional and while not exciting has everything you need for a workout. The onsite restaurant Auden was great for breakfast it was included for us during our stay but it is very expensive. The staff there was exceptional. See my review on that. We did not do club level. Also if you have to feel anyone who missed breakfast by sleeping in there is a good sandwich shop around the corner south on Sixth Avenue for a quick bacon egg cheese sandwich. The location of this hotel is central and convenient. While the rooms are clean and beautiful they do need some freshening and an electrical outlet bar for iphones and other devices would be an nice updated feature. The carpet needs to be replaced. For an NYC hotel room there is ample space both in the room and bathroom. Water pressure good separate WC ample toiletries and hairdryer at the ready. A C was very effective so getting into that incredible bed while the room is cold in the middle of the summer was delicious. We did not stay in a park view room so we never really looked out the window. For us being price motivated we were fine with that. The room itself was beautiful so we did not care.
