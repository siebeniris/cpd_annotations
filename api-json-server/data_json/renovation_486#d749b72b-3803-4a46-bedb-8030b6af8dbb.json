I am a luxury hotel employee and naturally bring additional scrutiny that many travelers would not so keep that in my when reading my review. I was traveling for work with a few of my associates staying in a room that my boss had booked for us through Expedia. There were some issues at check in with communication of the reservation from Expedia to the hotel but the Front Desk Supervisor Jesus handled the situation quite well. All of the rooms being suites is of huge convenience but they are a bit dated and the bathrooms are in desperate need of an update. The room was well cleaned but there were stains on the ceiling of the bathroom. Another reason this hotel gets a 3star review is because of the customer service. Little details make an entire experience and not calling me by name after checking my ID at check in or asking me how my stay was at check out left a bit to be desired. The breakfast was fine but they keep the bacon sausage behind the counter where they make the omelets so I feel as if I am inconveniencing the one chef who has to balance handing out these items while making omelets. Overall would recommend as an affordable hotel when visiting the surrounding area but this hotel should not be the purpose of your visit.", "offset": [479, 610], "date": "2015-10-25", "cpt": "0", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 4, "uid": "f6338fef-ebbf-4449-95e3-2b4465165627", "sentence": "Good. The suite was quiet comfortable and easily accessible to the atrium. The bed and pillows were very comfortable and the bathroom fixtures and layout was very nice. The overall maintenance of the facility seems to be slipping. Carpets throughout are becoming threadbare broken signage often goes unrepaired and emergency phone near the exercise room is missing completely Is this a fire and safety code item. Also much of the exercise equipment is is need of routine maintenance and the weight machine is difficult to use and outdated. The bathroom door is in need of repair on it is backside where water from the tub shower has ruined the veneer. The worst problem was with the breakfast. The bacon and sausage being served was obviously old and stale on the verge of being dangerous. I alerted the waiter about it and observed that he did nothing as in speaking to the cook or floor manager. So I reached the conclusion that food service purposefully uses outdated food to get by on the cheap. Hotel literature and pictures on line show a bathroom scale as being in every room. There was none in our room. Consequently I was concerned that we may be charged for the missing scale but the front desk clerk said the scales had been removed and I would not be charged. So your literature should be updated to reflect this change.

The lighting in the room was horrible very dark CFL lightbulbs. TVs are the old fashioned tube type televisions that were around in the 80sThere are serious mechanical problems at this hotel. Some guests reported AC was horrible. Others noted water dripping through the ceiling. Elevators are terribly slow. Oh and by the way none of the bathrooms have an exhaust vent. So rather than embarrass themselves with a long bathroom visit several of our guests found themselves going to the public restroom in the lobby when they had some business to do. The front desk people especially the Indian looking woman I apologize I do not remember her name we are not helpful and even a bit rude even to my 80year old mother when she tried to check it. Rooms were not ready when promised. Guests arrived at 2 pm several had to wait hours for the room. The only thing that brought them up from zero stars to one star was their brunch she is pretty darn good. Restaurant staff are also very nice.

Although the reviews have been a bit mixed. I had a great evening at this hotel. The staff were engaging and friendly. The room was spacious well set up and in good repair. It is truly a suite configuration with a separate living area consisting of a sofa table credenza and television. Elite members have access to the pantry. This is essentially a self serve snack area. Arriving very late it had a few snack choices sorbets and beverages. In the morning there was a typical continental breakfast with boiled eggs pastries breads cereals etc. Pretty much what Mariot promises elites. You can take it back to your suite or down to the atrium tables. The gym is quite nice with a range of pulley machines dumb bells aerobic equipment and enough room to do a body weight workout. This gym is much better than typical. Overall I had a great stay and would return. The architecture is similar to a lot of the atrium style Embassy Suites locations. Probably nice when there is a blizzard outside.

Before our recent stay this place was a Wyndham Mariot and it catered to everybody. Now it is the Delta Hotel which seems to be mainly designed for the business person a short stay traveler who is only there to sleep and not spend much time there. There is nothing wrong with that at all because although we were there to visit family our room was comfortable and clean and nicely furnished. We always stay in a suite because our youngest son stays with us and that room option is still available. There is no breakfast included buffet in the central sitting area of the second floor like before and I miss that. However they do have a small restaurant bar area which offers limited meals and alcoholic beverages of course. They need to work on their and offer more choices. My son loved their French toast which was served with vanilla ice cream for breakfast a perfect meal to have on a \u201c vacation \u201d and a cheeseburger and fry option he ate at dinner and lunch twice. For myself I have to mention the biscuits and gravy. Please make it simple. Take all that pepper spice out of it. The gravy should look white or beige with chunks of sausage in it. The biscuits should be cut out of a floured dough and baked in a 400 degree oven. I \u2019m really not even sure how they made the biscuits.
