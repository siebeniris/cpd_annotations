I\u00b4m going on May of 2015But when I sent an e mail asking for the rate of the room and other details was promptly answered by Suzete Daye that showed me the new mentality of the hotel by being clear about the services they provide saying what the improvements is going on and giving me instructions about the surroundings and how to get to Comerica Park. This attitude and transparency for sure were crucial to the decision I\u00b4ve made on staying at The Corktown Hotel. After my stay I will return with comments about the hotel itself. Stay tunedAgora em Portugu\u00eas. Eu ainda n\u00e3o fiquei no The Corktown Hotel. Eu ficarei em Maio de 2015Mas quando eu enviei um e mail para saber o valor da di\u00e1ria e outros detalhes. fui prontamente atendido pela Suzete Daye que me mostrou a nova mentalidade do hotel sendo clara sobre os servi\u00e7os que eles oferecem dizendo os melhoramentos que est\u00e3o acontecendo e me dando instru\u00e7\u00f5es sobre as redondezas e como chegar at\u00e9 o Comerica Park.

We stayed just one night but wish we could have stayed longer. This hotel is under new management and undergoing renovations. Our room was a bit outdated but clean. You can tell there has been a lot of effort by the new team to change the look and atmosphere of the hotel. We had an issue with the plumbing in our room and were floored by the effort management took to amend things for us. We were fortunate enough to be able to be moved to one of their new concept rooms. It was absolutely gorgeous. I ca nt say enough about it. It had a cool modern industrial look and amazing details. I also love that all the rooms are set back from the hallway cutting out traffic noise from the hall.

The site advertises beautiful rooms however when we arrived the first room we were given room 401. the rug was filthy the room was old and to top that all off there was a huge cockroach still alive and kicking under the sink. Seeing as we paid 160 plus tax Canadian for our room on the weekend of August 22 I was not expecting such a filthy place. I called the front desk from the room and indicated that we could not stay here because I can not do cockroaches. The girl was not surprised and offered us an upgrade. As there was no hotels available in Detroit because of many events being held I had two choices to sleep in my truck or to take the upgrade. We took the up grade room 304 which was not much of an upgrade at all. Yes it had a hotub which I was scared to use the boxspring looked like it had been in the dumpster the window sills had cigarette ashes on them and the walls around the A C was buckling and cracking. This hotel should not be using these rooms if they are renovating and advertising the new rooms.

We were going to be in Detroit on a night when the Tigers were at home and there were 2 concerts occurring. Every hotel we had stayed at previously was booked after reading the reviews on Tripadvisor thanks to everyone by the way we decided to give The Corktown Hotel a try reserved a remodeled room. The rooms are not large but feel spacious there was plenty of room for the 2 of us. The renovated rooms contain a bed a lounge chair a desk two metal chairs as well as a fabric shelf that would hold clothes. The sink is open to the room separate from the toilet shower. There is not a refrigerator or a microwave although there is a microwave near the lobby by the coffee tea and pop snack machines. They have a pop machine that costs 75 10 which is a great deal compared to other hotels costs of 250. The price may be based on the fact that the pop is not cold but there is an ice machine right there glasses are in your room. The hotel does have a laundry room which is where you will find an iron an ironing board. The renovated rooms do not have a telephone but in this era of cell phones it likely will not matter to most. WiFi is free and it works. we had asked the two clerks on duty the directions to walk to Ford Field neither had any idea. We discovered to just walk left down Trumbull to Michigan and turn right. it is probably a little more than a mile to Comerica Park and Ford Field it was an easy walk in the afternoon. there is not a lot around the Corktown Hotel right now so I had advise taking a taxi if you are returning after dark. Coffee tea are available in the morning it would be extremely helpful if lids were available for the styrofoam glasses. The renovated rooms are very well done the others are absolutely dated but appeared to be clean. There certainly is not a welcoming atmosphere when arriving others had mentioned the bulletproof glass it definitely is there. When you check in you must use a buzzer to gain access to the lobby after that you use your room card. While it will not alleviate the bulletproof glass some concern with needing to be buzzed in some pots of flowers outside inside would help the ambience so to speak. The locked parking area is free. Oh yes the mirror. I do not know what kind of lights are in that mirror but the result is astonishing a lot of my wrinkles simply did not appear. I am going to have to find out what lighting they use make a hat with a battery operated light shining in my face.
