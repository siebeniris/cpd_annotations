So last December January we stayed at various Hilton properties on our way to and from Florida. So this past week my wife and I spent 3 nights south of the border with 2 nights at a hotel in the Aleghanys and then our last night at this Double Tree in Easy Syracuse. So I normally do masses of research into hotels and locations before booking anything but for this trip it was all very sudden so I went with price and location. On arrival the hotel seemed very dated 80s style red brick and nothing very architecturally pleasing but. you walk through the front doors and all is forgiven. The place advertises as having been recently renovated and they are not kidding. A very pleasing entrance lobby foyer with the restaurant area off to the left more on that later a great fireplace seating area in the centre with a bar on the far side and then the reception tucked off to the right. Lots of seating very modern without being to cold and just a pleasant way to enter a hotel. Check in was a breeze and because we are Hilton Honors members albeit relatively new ones. we were assigned a room on the top floor of the hotel. If you have difficulties walking then the hike to the elevators from the lobby might be an issue but apart from that there are no issues. The top 3 floors are advertised as Hilton Honors floors when you get off the elevator and they appear to have all been renovated as well. The hallways are not the usual dull and toned down colours you see in a lot of hotels but are in fact bright and whiteWe had a king bed non smoking room that faced south. Nice new LG tv with an excellent selection of channels very comfy bed plus room fridge and renovated bathroom. Now lets just talk about the only two negatives of the hotel. First of all the pillows are just not like the pillows we have used at previous Hiltons. They seemed plump and feathery at first but your head sank right through them and hit the mattress. To be honest we normally travel with our own pillows so if you can not do that then maybe just request some extra pillows. The second negative the state of the window and balcony. The window did not look like it had been cleaned since before the winter and there was pigeon crap all over the balcony and the one chair that was out there. In the big scheme of things its not a major negative its not like I had spectacular views of the Rockies or wanted to be out on the balcony sipping Mai Tais while gazing out at Waikiki. but the windows could do with a bit of a scrub. Nice comfy sleep on the mattress though one of the reasons we continually choose Hiltons is because of the sleeps we have had in the past and this coming Christmas I have 9 nights booked at 5 different Hilton properties based on this fact plus some other things we like about the chain. They have signs posted in the hotels of the various functions they hold in the evening. The night we were there it was happy hour from 7 pm to 10 pm and we got to enjoy beers priced at about 350 for domestic. Nice touch there as well. We also wanted to watched the Toronto Blue Jays v Yankees game but the bar was turned into football. My wife went to the front desk and a very nice staff member came out and changed the big tv close to the restaurant over to the game. So we could sit in the restaurant and have a bite to eat while watching our team slowly see their play off spots fade away into the distanceAs for the restaurant. Well first of all very pleasant and prompt service from the ladies working in there. Secondly we ordered the meat lover pizza and it was fantastic. Way better than you would get from any chain pizza place and way better than anything I have ever had from a mom and pop style joint. I do not know who does their menu and their cooking but they obviously know what they are doing. I checked out other guests food and from the presentation to the looks on peoples faces it is obvious this hotel is on to a winner in this restaurant. So apart from the two pretty minor negatives the positives far out weigh the negatives. Its a great hotel priced just right and you do not have to leave the place to get a high quality and well priced meal and a drink.", "offset": [1625, 1735], "date": "2017-08-13", "cpt": "1", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 12, "uid": "0fc47f96-e3f2-4893-baff-b0d163693135", "sentence": "Not up to the Hilton name. My husband myself and our two children stayed this past Saturday night as we were going to the State Fair on Sunday. Though we only stay in hotels a few times a year I always choose Hilton Hotels when possible and am a Hilton Honors member. I am not overly critical of hotel rooms but our room was definitely not up to the Hilton name. The lobby has been redone and is very nice. The woman that checked us in was very friendly. We had a balcony room that the description said overlooked the courtyard. When we got to the room our balcony overlooked the parking lot. We could have lived with that but the balcony 1 had absolutely no chairs or a table though the balconies facing the courtyard did have tables and chairs as I saw when we went to the pool and 2 was beyond filthy with left over beer caps still there from a previous guest. The sliding glass door going out to the balcony looked like it had not been cleaned in months. I still gave them a pass as I know housekeeping has a lot to do to get all the rooms ready and the balcony is probably out of sight out of mind. As we were settling into the room we noted that the bed sheet on one of the beds was stained. Not like just stained and not changed more like it had been washed and the stain was still there. Housekeeping should know not to put stained sheets on any bed. We found almonds on the floor left over from a previous guest the ceiling was a popcorn ceiling and it appeared that there had been water damage in multiple locations. It was disgusting to look at. We discovered the next morning that there were only two bath towels in the room even though our reservation clearly had four people down. I do not feel its my job to have to call down for additional towels. it is not like we had two surprise guests. We made due with two towels as we needed to check out anyway. The hot tub by the indoor pool was often over run with kids under 16. I never even saw staff even come into the pool area. let alone say something to the kids or their parents who were in there with them. Again not my job to police the hot tub and go ask staff to handle it. I was prepared to say something politely on check out when I was asked how my stay was to my surprise the woman who checked me out did not inquire to how my stay was. A first for my Hilton stays. We come out every year to the State Fair sometimes we stay over night sometimes we do not.
