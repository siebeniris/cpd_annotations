Waterfront is a cute hotel with a waterfront location at Jack London Square convenient to many great spots in Oakland. It is clean cozy and comfortable with a happy hour and friendly staff members who create a warm atmosphere. The morning after my first night I was woken up by housekeepers talking and laughing loudly in the hall early one day. On my second morning at 9 am on a Sunday after having been out late the night before I was startled awake by a house keeper knocking rapidly three times and then pushing the door open before waiting for a response while I was still in bed. In addition the hotel is located very near working train tracks so I was also kept awake at night by train whistles. That was part of the charm but next time will bring earplugs. My room did technically have a balcony which I was grateful for but it faced mostly other walls so the room was dark and the balcony uninviting. Finally the only parking available cost 32 a night which seemed excessive on top of the price of the hotel stay.", "offset": [438, 677], "date": "2019-11-16", "cpt": "3", "category": "general"}, {"id": 32, "uid": "db7126c9-a9cb-4167-891e-94cfe0017fba", "sentence": "Exceptional.

Some touchpoints were nice Jonathan Adler bathroom products. and some were weird a living room area in the suite that felt empty and underconsidered all light switches on the hinge side of doors etc. Location and view is great but the worst part for us was the fact that to get to my moms handicapped room from the front desk or drop off point before the valet she had to walk to the next building over as none of the handicapped rooms can be accessed from the front door. For her that is very scary feeling isolated from help if needed. Plus every time we came with the car to drop her off or pick her up we had to explain the need to drive through the valet parking to the valets. They were friendly but it was definitely a hassle and felt like a system not designed with handicapped customers in mind.
