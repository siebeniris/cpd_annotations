I honestly did not expect much after that we were told that 3 pm was check in and that they would allow early check in will be allowed if available. My husband after checking out of the other hotel at 10 pm will be waiting for 5 hrs i was training in our office so i would not be able to accompany him. So he got in at 130 and got an early check in. I was super relieved checking in according to him was a breeze. We got a city view room with big windows looking out to centre point tower we were delighted at least we still got a view the room was classic luxury. Black marble bathroom faultless and clean. Tasteful decors and fursnishings high quality duvet awesome smelling room aircon was quiet i did nt think it was working when i turned it on automatic blackout shutters. I briefly worked in four seasons and i know what to inspect in 5 star luxury rooms this just scored 100 perfect. Let us talk about the facilities Classic grand entrance lovely sitting areas reception awesome tea room with lovely cakes petit fours etc business centre with touch screen lenovo units and it the lobby smells like versace perfume there s a versace store in the lobby it looks and felt like lux the bar was also looking quite cool with a big atrium looking glass overlooking Hyde park gym fully equipped the spa looks amazing the pool so perfect on the rooftop very inviting with the view of the park and St Marys Chapel it was awesome. Now about the service in the hotel. I wanted to see the pool around 11 pm and we could nt locate it asked reception who courteously advised that we needed to take the far right elevators level 22 but advised pool closes at 9 pm he called somebody to take us up to open the elevator again and took us at the 22nd floor the pool area door was closed up but he went to all that effort to show us. when we were done we went down to the lobby again and sat down the same reception guy saw me again and asked if we were taken up to the pool that was a follow up. My ears were clapping. \u2b50 \ufe0f \u2b50 \ufe0f \u2b50 \ufe0f \u2b50 \ufe0f \u2b50 \ufe0f Five star. The morning of check out i had a hard time getting my husband out of bed he loved the bed he wanted to stay but valentines day is quite pricey so i did nt opt to stay longer So we went to concierge and I asked Mike if were supposed to check out earlier than advised You see Dusit Thani Manila locked us out of our room 30minutes prior advised check out. so i was traumatized. He said that check out time is really 11 pm but we can elave our bags there no time limit to still explore the city. Omigodnes. I was so happy we got extended time to explore. My husband and I were very thankful to Mike mentioning this to us. So I decided to sign up for Spg My husband who hates signing up for memberships to avoid publicly flaunting confidential information was so happy he wanted me to join. All I can say to this Sheraton staff is thank you for the wonderful Valentine. \u2764 \ufe0f \u2764 \ufe0f \u2764 \ufe0f We will be back \u270c \ufe0f.", "offset": [2159, 2321], "date": "2015-02-14", "cpt": "0", "category": "facility"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "74b6f2e5-6dd1-42ad-8047-fd2144663016", "sentence": "Internet charges.

Nowadays most hotels do not chatge for internet as it is a utility and required by everybody. I spoke to the duty manager and his reply was just pay it everbody else charges so we do too.
