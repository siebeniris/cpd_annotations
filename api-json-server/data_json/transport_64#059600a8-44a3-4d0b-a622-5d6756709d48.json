We stayed at the Gran Melia Golf Resort in Puerto Rico from December 27 2014 January 3 2015 celebrating our honeymoon. The resort itself is absolutely beautiful. It is mostly outside and has its share of wild life with birds and a koi pond in the lobby. In addition to the usual restaurants on site there are quite a few places for you to relax and unwind. The grounds are well kept and the scenery is amazing. They even have a beach on site and golf carts to carry you all around the grounds. The gift shop like most hotel gift shops was greatly overpriced. The room had a refrigerator but it was not very cold and there was no microwave. So you are pretty much at the mercy of room service unles you plan on eating a cold salad. Even motel 6 \u2019s and Super 8 \u2019s have a microwave and refrigerator. Our issues though were significant enough to put a damper on our special time together. There was a lack of cars at Avis which is right in the lobby of the hotel they only had seven when we checked in and they went early. it took us four hours to rent a car. When I asked about a shuttle to the airport to rent a car I was told that the shuttle only comes twice a day at 10 and 30. I said from a hotel. I realize that Avis is not affiliated with the Gran Melia directly but they are the company they elected to have on site to perform their car rental service. The day we checked in we did not need a rental car but the following day there was no one servicing the desk for long periods of time. Then I realized it was because she was the only Avis employee there and she was rounding up cars and making sure they were cleaned out as well as renting them. The car we received was not even cleaned after the prior user. It was literally just given to us. Also parking is additional fee. If you rent a car from Avis you can park at their lot for free but it is a bit of a walk through the dark parking lot the lights need to be fixed we left out early in the mornings and it was pitch black with no exterior lights back to your room. Of course there were only about 15 spaces for Avis rentals on two occasions cars were blocking other cars in and it was hard to maneuver out of those tight spaces. All the tours from the hotel depart EARLY in the morning. In fact we arrived at the desk at 910 and learned that the final tour for the day was at 90am. So if you want to do a tour you better book your stay in advance or research. Our issues were with the lack of customer service accountability and the daily issues with housekeeping. While traveling I always shower twice daily and whether I am at home or away I never use the same towel more than once. I realize that this is a personal preference but for the amount of money I spent on my honeymoon if my husband and I want to be able to shower twice daily that is our right. The room had a smell to it kind of like mildew. I assume because of the proximity to the water. The bathroom was nice but the first day I noticed droplets of blood about seven or eight on the art work in the shower. I also noticed tiny little bugs that were on the floor near the toilet. And what would be a running theme for the duration of our stay was the fact that the room did not have enough towels. I immediately called housekeeping and explained my needs. They sent up additional towels the following day and the issue with the bugs was resolved. Every day our room was cleaned in the morning and when we returned in the evenings I had to call down to get towels and or washcloths. I had to go down to the desk on Monday and I was given beach towels. On Tuesday I called Housekeeping the front desk and the Concierge multiple times each and the phones went unanswered for 20 minutes. When housekeeping did answer they told me that they would send someone right away. After waiting an hour for them to come I went down to the front desk. Where I proceeded to stand in line for an additional 25 minutes and where one woman bypassed the line of people waiting and went right to the counter and started screaming at the representative. He overlooked everyone else in line and immediately helped with her issue. Then when another representative helped me I explained to him that my time was just as valuable as hers and I did not appreciate the lack of service I received. I asked for a manager. The manager apologized for the issues with the towels and said they corrected the problem. I explained that the blood drops were still in my shower and that is a health hazard. I also explained that the issue with the towels is frustrating. It should get progressively better not worse. One day you do not have enough towels or wash cloths the next day you do n\u2019t have any. When you come back from excursions in 85 degree weather you want to shower and unwind. You do n\u2019t want to return to your room hours after the room was cleaned and not find one clean towel was left in the room or the toilet paper roll not replenished. The manager apologized and merely said that the equipment to clean the towels was down but just repaired. I told him I did not want to hear a bunch of excuses on vacation my honeymoon no less. I just wanted to enjoy the time I was there. He said unfortunately your stay has been paid for in advance so there is nothing I can do to reimburse you for the discomfort except offer you a free massage at the spa. He then sent me back to my room to wait on the towels and promised they would be there within the hour. I told him that if they were not there in an hour I would be returning to the desk. They came 5 minutes late when I was heading out the door. He called back to check on the towels and I asked could we have the free breakfast instead. He granted that request but for the remainder of the stay except the final night before checking out the towels remained an issue. And all I received after spending thousands on my honeymoon and being aggravated from beginning to end was a free overpriced breakfast. They also sent someone up to clean up the blood drops and she tried to tell me that it looks like it was just red paint and not blood. The d\u00e9cor was white so I \u2019m not sure how she thought it was red paint but whatever. On New Year \u2019s morning I had to call the front desk twice to report our neighbors who had 4 5 young children and three rooms and allowed them to run up and down the halls yelling screaming and playing. The second time I was awaken at 330 am from yelling in the courtyard. It stopped maybe 30 minutes later. The next day our neighbors again had the kids in the hallways running up and down the stairs and littering and this was broad daylight. They also had their TV up so loud that I could understand clearly the words that were coming out of the TV. I called again to complain about the noise and a little while later I assume my neighbors did not appreciate the noise complaints so they had a child call and play on the phone. They called twice and the second time the child proceeded to call me a profane name laughed and hung up. I immediately called the front desk and informed them that they better talk to them because if I or my husband go over there we will not be friendly. The calls stopped and the annoyances checked out the next day. Overall the resort is beautiful but for this to be my honeymoon it left a bad taste in my mouth. I may return to Puerto Rico but I doubt if I would stay at the Gran Melia again.", "offset": [1088, 1210], "date": "2015-01-23", "cpt": "0", "category": "transport"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "2316d05d-367a-4ea3-8dea-aed558c6f7ef", "sentence": "Nice property but not worth the money. First off i m not one of those people who goes on vacation and looks for things to complain about. My wife and i chose the gran melia in puerto rico because it was the cheapest but yet the best looking resort on pricelinecom. We spent four days three nights. Here were our pros and cons. Pros. beautiful looking resort room are very pretty considering price. Cons. location is far away from everything. Minimum of 35 cab ride to closet venue including shopping mall or eating. Polside bars extermely under staffed. Busy weekend one bartender each bar. Waited 35 minutes to be served. The drinks are EXTREMELY overe priced considering they are mostly juice. 80 cab ride each way to airport. If you are far from the pool area you wait for a shuttle tomoick you up takes forever to wait. No rooms services late. Bars close early so considering the resort has nothing within driving distance to eat and drink you will go to bed hungry. I ve stayed in 3 different resorts in PR and this one was by far the worst. Even the system they have to yab your drinks is off. We had no water in our bathroom the first night our balcony door was broken and did nt open and the night managerdidnt care abt any of our complaints.

This place is very far from everything. Given that they close everything early you would think they would allow you to buy your own food and drinks. Think again we got stopped for bringing water to our room because the night before there was no place to buy water there are no vending machines. If it were based on beauty it would get 4 stars but it is not and I have to say it was a very aggravating experince to stay at this resort. there is also no shuttle buses we had a rental but it would nice to take a shuttle. there is no entertainment on site.

We were part of a large group for a wedding in February. The service was terrible. Our room was not cleaned for two days and then they blamed me saying I left the do not disturb tag on our door. I know that I did not because we did nt even HAVE a do not disturb tag. We had the Red Level Room which was a crock because I never saw the butler. We paid extra for pretty much nothing. The room smelled like mildew and had black mold in the vents. The TV did not work at all. The wi fi was non existent. The only positive side was breakfast. But there were not enough people on staff so there were about 20 tables still dirty because there was not enough people to bus them. So we had to wait forever for breakfast each day for a clean table to open up. Also my friend had jewelry stolen out of her room and has been jumping through hoops for over a month to try to get it rectified. All the while security and management has been giving her the runaround telling her they know nothing about her case. but then someone else turns around and says their insurance company denied her claim and then they go back and say that their insurance company is not done investigating. but then another person will tell her that they have a denial letter yet they never sent a copy to her despite numerous requests.

My boyfriend and I late 20s. early 30s stayed at Gran Melia for 4 nights. We were a bit nervous since the reviews were all over the place but had a pretty good time. Pros. The grounds are beautiful it felt pretty private the staff was pretty accommodating and helpful especially the waitstaf at the restaurants. The rooms were not stunning or anything and are in need of some updates soon ex. the shower faucet was coming apart from the wall but they were no where near creepy motel level. I had put them along the lines of decent run of the mill hotel. Cons. This might be a pro but it is also a little off the beaten path. We ended up renting a car it is about 30 minutes from San Juan. My friends who joined me took a cab and it ran about 80 yikes. The resort is also at the end of a very long road 2 3 miles where there is NOTHING so if you are car less you are pretty much limited to what the food bev offerings are on the grounds. We liked having a car since we could drive to other food options walmart for beers etc. RESTAURANTS. At the resort we ate at Wet Tempo and Pasion. Food was pretty decent everywhere and the wait staff are extremely lovely. I might be jaded coming form NYC but I did not think the prices were that out of line. I mean you are at a resort there is going to be a mark up. But glasses of wine were 7 9 cocktails around 11 entrees around 20. not that bad right. Pasions portions are huge Tempo was great. We also drove about 10 minutes east to this stretch of food kiosks by a beach Ceviche Hut is AMAZING. So tasty. BUGS. Also some people complained about bug bites you are in a tropical location. there are bugs. Keep your door closed to the room and do not hang around the hammocks at dusk when sand fleas come out and you will be fine. BEACH. so the peninsula Gran Melia is on is protected as in the waves break on the reef about a mile out. So the water that rolls up to the beach is super calm and shallow. Like 2 feet of water 100 yards out shallow. So not great for swimming as there is a bunch of sea grass too but really great for wading. There are plenty of lounge chairs and hammocks you can even drag the lounge chairs into the water which I recommend. There are stretches with more sand than others also this sand is a little more rocky shely than others. Not enough to hurt your feet but it is not that buttery soft sand if you are imagining that. RED LEVEL we did not get this but i assume it is nice. The red level bungalows are closer to everything but note the normal garden view bungalows are not that shabby either. And we did not really notice any set backs with normal level. So with all of that said this is a nice enough resort. We got a deal by packaging with flights my friend did not and paid 250 a night. Not really worth it for 250 so find a deal if you can seems like they are are a few out there.", "offset": [1597, 1672], "date": "2015-03-20", "cpt": "0", "category": "transport"}, {"id": 5, "uid": "d12f8c78-d09d-4530-b7e3-80c9fd7a8676", "sentence": "Beautiful Location Great Staff. My wife and I stayed here from 22 through 29. We had stayed at the nearby El Conquistador in previous years. We had stayed at another Melia resort in Mexico several years ago and decided to give this one a try after reading some of the reviews. It turned out to be a great experience. The grounds and facilities are beautifully maintained. it is a large property but if you do not feel like walking you can always catch a ride on one of the trams that go to and from the main building. you will need a car if you want to visit San Juan or eat at any of local eateries but the restauarants on the property are excellent. pricy but well worth it. We particulary enjoyed Pasion which featured Puerto Rican cuisine. If you are looking forward to a wide expance of white sand beach you might be disapointed. The surf is surrounded by large rocks with only a few openings and the sand is gritty. The pool area is beautiful. Our room was spacious and clean but the furnishings were worn and could use upgrading. The sofa in particular was soiled and stained. The bathroom was fine but the shower tub area was poorly lit and the floor of the tub was somewhat slippery. Not a good combination. The supplied fridge was tiny and barely kept a few water bottles cool. It is obvious that management discourages guests from bringing in food but a better fridge would be a vast improvement. we have found that the people always make or break the vacation and the staff here were always cheerful helpful and knowledgable. The location is fairly isolated and a car rental would be necessary to visit San Juan or the beautiful beaches in Luquilo.

The Gran Melia is 30 40 minutes outside of San Juan and the property is secluded. Otherwise your only options are to eat at the restaurants located on the property which are quite pricey as one would expect from hotel restaurants. it is easy to get around if you rent a car. There are car rental options on the property as well. However you do have to pay for daily parking if you rent a car. There is not much of a beach here the true beaches are located 10 15 minutes away in Loquilo or Fajardo. The Gran Melia is not very kid friendly around activities on the location.
