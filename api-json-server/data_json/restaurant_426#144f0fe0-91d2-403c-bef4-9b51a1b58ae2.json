Beautiful lodge in spectacular natural surroundings. My wife and I decided to stay an extra night here. We stayed first 4 nights Mon Thurs in a Cottage room as we brought our 2 small dogs. We found Tenaya to be generally dog friendly overall. Recommend staying in a Cotagea bit rustic with your pups as opposed to a regular room especially if you are staying multiple nights. We kenneled the dogs on the property one of the days of our stay so we could go into Yosemite by ourselves. Front desk people were very nice and helpful on arrival. Concierge folks were great and showed us many optional activities. Jackalope restaurant was great for burgers but VERY pricey. Waiters were excellent. The extra night in a regular lodge room was great the rooms are nicely appointed. Do your homework before you stay by checking the Tenaya Lodge website.

This is a lovely safe place to stay for a relaxing Get away located just outside of Yosemites park. If you are looking for that opportunity for an outdoor day hiking and playing in the woods but still want to experience the comforts of hotel pampering after a long day than this is for you. There is a nice small hotel gift store indoors with additional supplies you may have forgotten to pack from hand gloves to swim suits. They have an indoor ice cream coffee cafe where you can purchase Smore Kits roasting forks included for their wonderful outdoor patio firepits. They are pricey for what you get but if you have not planned that out never experienced it California style or forgot to bring they have. we have met international tourists that have never experienced Smores before and find it unique and fun. I think this was smart of Tanaya Lodge to have on hand. There is fresh fruit as well as pre packaged energy bars fruit juices as well as other items that you might purchase from a small deli. We really enjoyed our hot coffee in the cool of the evening and then walking and relaxing in their outdoor plaza with outdoor seating. You can place an order for boxed picnic meals for a next day hike if you like here. Adults can order a glass of wine from their outdoor patio menu while kids enjoy hot cocoa and roasting Smore marshmelows in the outdoor firepits in the patio in the evening. The staff keeps the wood going and the outdoor firepits made for great outdoor ambience in the woods. It adds to the outdoor woodland experience. There is an indoor restaurant that you can eat at or you can order from their outdoor pizza place on the property and eat on their patio grounds. Tenaya Lodge will also provide a bus travel pick up for you into the National park if you had like to experience a more tailored tour package. We met some out of state travelers that were really looking forward to their second tour as they enjoyed their first. We did notice a rock climbing wall there and of course indoor as well as outdoor pools. The rooms are stocked with spa robes to walk to the pools in the hotel if needed. Parking is easy as they have valet for check in. This is huge after any long drive and evening arrival. Did I mention parking is easy. This was very nice after a long hike in the National Park as well. When you are tired and want to get to your room quickly this is the way to go. You will not find that at the competitor hotel within the park and you must completely empty your car carry all your belongings to your room or pay a hefty fine if animals are drawn to your car in the park in any way. Bears are attracted to lotions body sprays day coolers car fragrance in air vents and etc. Everyone we encountered on staff at Tanaya Lodge was professional helpful and pleasant. They seemed to staff with locals who care about representing well local community and staying professionally employed. The employees are not snooty or pretentious or unapproachable. Instead we felt they represented the calm lifestyle of the area. Also important we did not encounter employees too harried or bothered to help. They seemed to be local outdoor Californians mountain style. The staff people we spoke to seemed to be clear lovers of the outdoors respecting the beauty of the area. Remember real Californians work to live the outdoor life stye. You get that true Californian feel here. WiFi is quirky here but having stayed in the other hotel in Yosemite that is still better than what they had which was none in the room. Food pricing is average for California resort pricing and quick convenience. Within the rooms there are small refrigerators with a small freezer large enough for a freezer cooler pack if needed. The rooms have the basic toiletries and extras hair dryers iron extra blankets pillows coffee maker which is great after hikes and playing in the water in Yosemite. The room we stayed in had easy accessible extra plug ins for charging phones and etc. The hallway ice stations are also stocked with snack beverage machines for late snackers or early travelers again you pay the price of convenience but it is available. The breakfast buffet is decent and quite filling service is good. If you have special dietary needs Vegan or Gluten Free. we observed they were more than happy to accommodate. We appreciated the breakfast buffet and worth the money in the room stay package as it was filled with a good selection of fruits pastries and protein. We really enjoyed a picnic along the river in Yosemite after hiking around the amazing falls. There is so much to enjoy in Yosemite and Tenaya Lodge is not far from all the wonderful sites and gas station within the park. We really enjoyed our stay at Tenaya Lodge and highly recommend.

Decent size rooms good beds efficient A C Spa facility with a range of fee services good size fitness room open until 10PM. Concierge can arrange activities in winter or summer.

We stayed in a first floor room in the main wing attached to the hotel. Very comfortable and we could easily walk our dog by stepping out a screened door onto the lawn outside our room. The concierge also gave us a map to a nearby trail that was great for a leisurely walk for everyone. One of the highlights of our trip was going on the day long bus tour of Yosemite. Our guide Phil struck a great balance between being informative and entertaining us while not being too touristy cheesy and leaving us some quiet moments to just enjoy the scenery. Highly recommend the tour but specifically Phil as a guide. He brought a telescope and binoculars and we got to see several climbers scaling El Capitan. The bus is nicely equipped even has USB outlets to charge phones and we made a stop at the food court in the park for lunch. Saw a lot and we did not have to battle the crowds for parking ourselves on a busy Saturday and the tour did not feel rushed. For the cons we knew from the reviews we were paying a premium for the location and the hotel appreciates that once you are there you have a captive audience. But communication and customer service were subpar given what you are paying as others seem to have experienced. Examples. we arrived early and despite being told our room was nearly ready and they would prioritize it we waited several hours without any call. We had booked a half day tour through the concierge before arrival to find out the morning of the tour that only the full day option was available in hindsight full day was the right call but even our welcome packet at check. in listed a half day tour as confirmed for us. We tried to go to the more upscale restaurant and were told a table would be ready in 30 minutes only to find out at the 30 minute mark that it would be substantially longer. There were about 7 people manning the check in stand for the restaurants and so it was irritating and almost comedic. that not one of them could figure out sooner that the wait would be extended to ask us what we wanted to do. After asking ourselves we ultimately went to the more casual place where many of the same menu options are available. The food was fine and much better than I expected based on other reviews.
