The only positive thing about my stay was walking in the door for the first time. I was very surprised by the very nice old school layout of the lobby but after that things went downhill fast. My room was completely out dated. The wallpaper was some kind of dirty white canvis that was peeling off the walls the to smelled weird the first thing I did was open the window and turn on the air for ventalation. The bathroom is so ugly and small. When you open the door you have no choice but to open the door fully just to get to the toilet and you can forget about getting to the tub because the door swings in just missing the sink so you have to stand over the toliet close the door and then get in the tub and the reverse must be done to leave the bathroom. The sheets on the bed feel like someone used a gallon of starch on the bed set before making the bed the AC has two setting on at full blast or off lets just say I got very little sleep because I kept getting up adjusting the AC. Last but not least the hotel is doing construction on multiple floors that starts at 8 am forget sleeping in at all. This was such a waist of money. Because of this horrible stay I will not be using hotelscom any more to locate my last minute rooms. For the money I could have stayed at a Super 8 and still had a better room.
