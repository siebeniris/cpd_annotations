The breakfast was amazing we were spoilt for choice there was everything you could think of including champagne if you wanted it and the food was excellent.

Fabulous breakBoked via travelzo six months ago taking advantage of the hotels low season prices but still for well below usual prices for that time of yearWe were collected by the Kempinski shuttle transfer along with four mature ladies and welcomed by the concierge who immediately took charge of our luggage. We arrived at midday and so were not expecting to find our room ready as check in was meant to be 2 pm but we were hoping it would be as we were very tired having not had a nights sleep due to flight timings. We flew in from Birmingham on the 7 am flight meaning we left home at 330am the price you pay for getting a good deal but nothing whatever to do with the hotel but no matter because the guy on reception told us that he needed to make sure our room was perfect before he showed us to it so whilst waiting would we like to sit on the sun terrace and partake of some refreshment. It looked very inviting so we did. In fact he had already offered us some Moroccan tea at the desk which was refreshing. He gave us a temporary wifi password so we could catch up on social media and with friends as he put it which was brill as the first thing we all do these days when checking into our holiday hotel is post on facebok where we are lolAnyway he said he would sent out the waitress to take our order which would be on the house. We ordered a coffee and a water and were very pleasantly surprised to find it was accompanied by a small dish of olives. A bowl of crisps and some bicies. The setting was relaxing with soft music playing in the background and a beautiful sea view in front of us whilst sitting on a cosy rattan sofaBang on 2 pm the same guy came back to collect us and show us to our room. Once there he explained everything and asked if the room temperature was okay as the aircon was off because it was now winter. He was very helpful and pointed out the comfort booklet about pillows etc He explained breakfast times and evening dining and said to call if we needed anything. I think this was the best ever welcome to a hotal we have ever had and we have been to a lotOur room was huge it was deluxe and had a seaview despite not having paid for one The balcony was massive with two lounger chairs and a table plus plants spilling over the front meaning that the balcony area was private and not overlooked from above. The bed was lush and the bathroom a dream and everything was spotless. The room safe was free and the biggest I have seen plus it was a drwer making it easier to use than the front opening styleWe had bathrobes and slippers with the full range of complimentary toiletries. The toilet had a sliding glass panel and a bidet too plus a phone Lots of wardrobe and drawer space and a large minibar with lots of glasses of all typesWe had a complimentary bottle of red which was good wine and deliciousThe TV was enabled to accommodate our I pod so we could play our own music. We had not packed a lot of personal belongings as we only took hand luggage being a 3 night stay. There was a comfy two seater sofa in the room too along with wrting desk. All in all lots of space and storageThe thing I found most impressive though was the lighting which was varied along with a mix of soft and bright from rows of spots in the ceiling to standard lamp reading lamp over bed and bedside lamps and every bulb was workingAfter unpacking we used the top heated pool for a swim then dried off by walking through the gardens and along the public promenade behind the beach where we witnessed the most beautiful sunset everWe enjoyed cocktails in the lounge bar and the breakfast was knockout with everything from smoked salmon and sparkling wine to freshly baked bread you sliced yourself and cheeses and coldmeats. There was also a hidden corner for children to eat and draw at the same time where I found a backet of mickey mouse bread rolls a lovely touch. No less than five fresh fruit juices along with fresh fruit and cereals with a wide selection of dried fruit and nuts too plus yoghurt in glses with fruit puree. This is before you even start on the cooked breakfast. The lady who welcomed us a breakfast each morning was efficient polite friendly and fast. An evident huge asset to the breakfast area. We ate in the steak bar one night which was a little pretentious and expensive for our personal preference but none the less very good quality and enjoyable. it is certainly the first time I have ever been offered a teeny chair for my handbag which I am assuming is a new trend although quite a good one tbh despite being a little over the topwe also used the free indoor heated pool and steam room facility again amazingThe gardens are beautifully tended and are a huge asset to the hotel with sun loungers dotted all around with someone on hand to help if needed We also explored the cooks vegetable patch and orchard where oranges limes avocados grow along with fresh herbs and seasonanl vegetablesOne of the most enjoyable relaxing short breaks everWe would highly recommend this hotel it is sumptuous and the staff complete the experience all consistently lovely friendly and helpful.", "offset": [1546, 1763], "date": "2015-11-26", "cpt": "0", "category": "beach"}, {"id": 3, "uid": "2e917d45-ec33-4f50-807c-bc29f18f7966", "sentence": "Amazing experience.

Yet Not As Good As Other Kempinskis. The Kempinski Hotel Bahia is a great hotel when drawing a comparison to the general 5 star hospitality industry. However when comparing it to other Kempinski hotels in Europe it falls behind hence the Very Good. and not the Excellent rating on this site. If you are visiting this hotel during it off season period you should know that it is not running full steam. Ie Not all restaurants are open and those that are do not run 7 days a week. The hotels a c is centralised and hence was not switched on during the time we were there. Truth be told we did not need it during our stay but as other reviews had mentioned this is a problem during some unusual hot days lucky we did not experience one. On the other hand since the hotel was not full we had no problem getting a table for breakfast or finding chairs and umbrellas on the lawn or pool area. The hotel was obviously quieter so there are definite plus sides to visiting during an off season prior. Hotel GroundsThe hotel itself is very well kept despite the fact that it is not the newest anymore. It has more of the classic feeling to it rather the modern one. However and more than anything else this is rather a question of taste. The grounds are also very clean and so is the pool area and lawns. However if you are heading here for a beach vacation you should know that the beach is public and hence not well kept as the parts belonging to the hotel. However and as said the lawns which are a part of the hotel are a very nice place to spend the day. House Keeping ServiceThe House Keeping services were very good and always left the rooms clean with more than an adequate amount of amenities fresh towels etc. However as far as timing was concerned it was very inconsistant. While where were days that the room had been clean while we were already at breakfast during other days the room had not been done till almost 4 pm. Same goes for the turn down service while one some days the room had been turned down before 7 pm already during others it was well after 9pm. FodThe Kempinski Breakfast lives up to the reputation of the name. Service is efficient. kind and there was a whole lot to choose from. When we where there the hotel started introducing an extras menu to their breakfast such as smoothies for around \u20ac 5 some omelets with local specialities such as Jamon or Red Shrimp for about \u20ac 12 and a caviar dish for about \u20ac 90. While it might be ok to wish to offer and charge someone for specialities the extra wanted for the smoothies seemed to be a bit of a money grabbing sham. La Cuchina de mi Abuela which is the hotels tapas bar had good food and wine but was very very loud even with only a couple of small groups sitting there. The hotel should really think about solving the acoustic problem there as it kept us from returning. Both the Alminar which is the signature restaurant and La Cabana del Mal had good food friendly service and a nice atmosphere. However they both left us with a feeling that we paid too much for what we got. Room Service menu was extensive but at the same time also quite expensive. It asked more than the other restaurants of the hotel for the same dish. LocationThe hotel is located roughly between Marbela and Estapona meaning that it will take you about 15 minutes to reach each of those city centres. There is a small shopping centre located at about 10 minute walk from the hotel which has some nice restaurants and shops and a bit further down the road there is an Aldi shop for the rest of your shopping needs. Problematic Truth in Advertising Room DescriptionWe had the Premier Plus room for our stay at the hotel. We choose it based on the fact that offered sea front views as described on the hotels website. Premier Plus Rooms provide an unparalleled view of the entire Marbela Bay and Moroccan coast. However despite the fact that the room indeed has a forward facing view of the bay you could hardly see the entire Marbela Bay and Moroccan coast as the website boasts since your view is boxed by the hotels wings. The hotel is built as an open courtyard facing the sea. The Premier Plus rooms are situated in the middle of the courtyard facing the sea forward. Therefore the only rooms which do enjoy view of the entire Marbela Bay are the couple of suites situated at the corners of the hotel wings. It truly is a shame that Kempinski have created such ambiguity on their website.", "offset": [3780, 3873], "date": "2017-04-09", "cpt": "0", "category": "beach"}, {"id": 5, "uid": "193964ee-ca94-4d66-bab3-c5132a0eeb95", "sentence": "Pretty spot.

My daughter and I spent four nights here two as part of a tour group and two on our own as an extension. The resort is really beautiful and very luxurious. Our room was spatious and had a lovely terrace overlooking the property with a view of the sea and an old medieval tower. The bathroom was really spatious and comfortable. Breakfast was good. Service was excellent throughout the hotel. There are three beautiful pools as you head down to the beach. The only caveat is this the Mediterranean is surprisingly cold even though we were experiencing a heat wave the water was really really cold and the beach is rocky. Definitely bring water shoes if you plan to go into the sea and you really should. even though it is cold the water is clear and refreshing and there are no waves to speak of. The resort is located next to a small mall with restaurants and beach shops. There are a few lovely touches in the lobby area a large library with some truly magnificent art books and two delightful parrots in the entry way. Also there is a sweet hotel cat that can sometimes be found on the property. There is a facility right next to the hotels beachfront that rents paddle boats and provides various types of water experiences we did not really check it out so I can not speak to it but the paddle boats looked nice.

Stayed here for a long weekend with my partner. We arrived just before lunch and our room was ready on arrival. Check in was smooth and did not take very long. The room was lovely and spacious absolutely spotless bathroom was huge with a seperate bath and shower double sink and large mirror. Lovely balcony to sit out on with partial sea view but be aware this hotel is on a main dual carriageway so we had the road noise when sat out on there but the road could nt be heard inside the room with the doors shut. This did nt really affect our stay and could not be heard elsewhere in the hotel. The pool areas were spotless plenty of sunloungers and there are cabanas that can be hired. Pool bar is good and they come and take your order from the lounger and bring it to you. The beach is nt the nicest and is a bit pebbly. The sea was quite rough aswel. Breakfast was amazing. So much choice you most certainly would not go hungry. There were so many different foods to choose from and plenty of it with lots of deinks available too. The food in the restaurants was lovely. Menu is nt huge but if you like steak or fish then you will be just fine. It is a little pricey which is to be expected in a hotel with a steak being around \u20ac 34 but the quality of the food made up for this. I would highly recommend the Balck Rose for cocktails. The barman there was lovely and friendly would stop and chat with us and he made the best cocktailsAl the staff we came into contact with were friendly polite efficient and really are a credit to this hotel. They all worked really hard. There is nt much near this hotel that we found but we did nt go out exploring so can not comment on what is actually near the hotel. A taxi to Puerto Banus was \u20ac 25 each way which is quite pricey for a 10 minute taxi ride. I would say this hotel is aimed more towards adults as there is not much for kids to do even though there is a kids club there.
