Friday 20 October 2017. Two separate hotels on consecutive Fridays in Manchester. This stay at the Radison Edwardian was the second \u2013 to see London Grammar at the 02 Apollo. We booked late a Deluxe king room overlooking the city with breakfast included. Check in was smooth and efficient \u2013 we were shown to our room by the concierge who over the whole stay provided a good service. I was asked for my mobile number on check in and later I received messages from the virtual concierge who answered questions like where is the nearest ATM and was actually a rather a good innovation. In my view overall the concierges add real value and I found could be relied on for pretty much any random query. The room was on the 1the floor at the front of the Hotel and had a lovely view of St Peter \u2019s Square. It was smaller than the previous week \u2013 but actually felt larger. There was one armchair and a small table with floor to ceiling windows. The room was quiet and comfortable the air conditioning was controllable. There was a separate basin area outside the bathroom. Inside the Bathroom there was a nice separate wet room style shower area plus a bath and shower head fitted to the bath. This really suited us. The towels and robes were fine. The toiletries were in dispensers but plentiful and nice enough. There was a trouser press. The Mini bar had a price list. The Room service menu was good and we thought food from room service would be quickest. I phoned the order in mentioning my Coeliac and Vegetarian diet. It was understood. We had risoto fries and vegetarian croquettes and white wine. It was great and well served. Rested and fed we left for the gig. Returning we decided to have a night cap in the Opus Bar and opted for a window seat raised up on the roadside. \u00a3 4 for a 300 ml bottle of Magners my ONLY criticism would be to suggest an English cider be stocked. Watching the nightlife of the city was enjoyable. I imagine we could have sat there all night. Breakfast for me is important and in a hotel it is the event that sets the mood for the day. I have to say the Breakfast restaurant was a little disappointing as the tables felt crowded together. a little small and overly functional. We have sat in motorway service areas with a better ambiance. There was the typical breakfast buffet but one advantage of a 5 star hotel is the cooked breakfast. So we ordered from that. I had omelette with mushroom and tomato with Gluten free toast. My partner wanted Eggs Benedict without the salmon the waiter cleverly suggested advocado. We both had coffee. Suffice to say the cooked breakfast redeemed the setting my partner particularly liked the combination she had. It was very good and came promptly. Check out was smooth and even though the Hotel were preparing for a busy day the receptionist had time and the ability to make conversation. I felt sad to be leaving. The bill was settled and was exactly as advertised. The taxi rank is immediately outside. The overall impression was rather like the Hotel in Pretty Woman \u2013 comfortable friendly and welcoming.

My wife and I returned recently from spending 5 nights towards the end of March 2019 at the Radison Blu Edwardian in Peter Street Manchester. This has been our favourite hotel in Manchester city centre over the last decade. Prior to our arrival we had been in eager anticipation this time to see for ourselves the results of a fairly major renovation of the ground floor area over the winter months though the changes were not quite as radical as we had been led to believe on our previous visit in 2018As on previous visits we were given a warm and friendly welcome on arrival this time by Katie at the remodeled reception desk. It does make a huge difference when guests are made to feel \u2018 at home \u2019 which is the case at this lovely hotel which is not as impersonal as other large hotels at which we have stayed in the UK and farther afield. Here all members of staff seem to understand the importance of engaging with the guests and giving them excellent service. On this visit the recently appointed Guest Relations Manager Barnaby Pazio introduced himself to us. He was absolutely first class in making us feel welcome and in sorting out any little problems we encountered. For example we had a problem with one of our wardrobe doors and advised him of it when we went out one morning. When we returned a few hours later it had been fixed. Now that is as it should be. We also had the pleasure of meeting Lindsey from the Hotel Conferences section at a complimentary drinks reception early one evening and she too was very pleasant and welcoming. Both of these are great additions to the Radison staff in Peter Street. We had booked a de luxe \u2018 easy access \u2019 room because my wife has a slight disability and is partially sighted. We were allocated room 120 which had both a walk in shower and a bath. The modern bedrooms in this hotel especially the bathrooms are very cleverly designed and have everything a guest could reasonably require. The king sized bed was firm but extremely comfortable and we slept well with no outside noise to disturb us. There was a table and two chairs a room safe and a refreshments tray replenished each day. A trouser press and an ironing board were in the room \u2013 I find the trouser press particularly useful. The free hotel Wifi for guests was fast and reliable. We always request a room with views over the city skyline and this means we can see the Town Hall clock illuminated throughout the night. We can imagine that it must have been rather disturbing in the hotel during the Winter renovations but we experienced absolutely no noise at any time during our stay. The breakfasts which are now served in the Peter Street Kitchen are good but not quite as good as they were on previous visits. The choices are replenished regularly and there are a few hot choices from an A la Carte menu which are specially prepared. I like to select the poached eggs on toast some mornings rather than a \u2018 Full English \u2019. At the risk of repeating myself we do not favour what seems to be a newish policy for Radison in only offering what might be termed \u2018 healthy options \u2019. For example the only milk on offer at the buffet was Soya Almond or skimmed and there were no corn flakes \u2013. probably Britain \u2019s most popular cereal choice. It \u2019s as if there is suddenly a world shortage of Corn Flakes because we encountered this at a Liverpool Hotel in January 2019 but in that case the popular cereal was supplied from the kitchen on request. We had a charming Greek waitress who very kindly brought us semi shimed milk from the kitchen when we requested it. We did find it rather contradictory that there was only butter on offer but no low fat spreadWhat used to be the Opus One Restaurant has gone now and been replaced by the re styled and renamed \u2018 Peter Street Kitchen \u2019 serving Mexican and Asian food. Frankly we are not experienced in that type of cuisine so were most grateful to the lead waiter who patiently talked us through the menu and guided us in our choices. We decided in the end to try the Chef \u2019s tasting menu and enjoyed it very much. It was not too spicy and we felt this meal was a big improvement on our poor experiences in the previous restaurant the old Opus One. The meal cost was \u00a3 218 for two including an optional 10 service chargeThe bar staff are very good and obliging. Indeed one of the mixologists we were told was top of his game in the Manchester area. We both thought the alcoholic drinks were very expensive. I had a single 50 ml Brandy one evening and was charged \u00a3 180On this visit we decided to try the Afternoon Tea which was also served in the Peter Street Kitchen. It was pretty busy. The staff were very pleasant and we found it to be a rather relaxing experience. Unfortunately the service was disappointing. We had booked well in advance but had to wait a while after we were shown to our table before anyone approached to serve us and we had to wave to a member of staff to order a couple of cocktails. The Spa in the basement area has been renovated too. Whilst we went down in the lift to look through the window at the pool area we did n\u2019t try any of the treatments. The new \u2018 Library \u2019 room on the ground floor was due to open in April 2019 as the work was not quite finished. We were advised that this new room will offer a relaxed environment with books to read where snacks and drinks will be available. This will prove a useful addition as the only eating option at the time of our visit was the main restaurant. The location of the hotel is ideal for theatres conference centres local restaurants and is not far from St Anne \u2019s Square and the main shopping district. One of the best features at this Radison Blu Edwardian is the extremely high standard of the excellent Concierge service. Chief Concierge Gary and his first rate team are so helpful and they seem to know the answer to every conceivable question offering helpful advice throughout our stay as usual. Nothing is too much trouble to this team whose knowledge and ability to second guess what guests need always impresses usWe are looking forward to our next visit to this fine hotel already.", "offset": [3873, 4039], "date": "2019-04-15", "cpt": "2", "category": "atmosphere"}, {"id": 19, "uid": "caa0d16e-93d5-4a8a-ba14-6707778064cc", "sentence": "Great staff and breakfast.

The primary purpose of a hotel is to provide somewhere for people to sleep when away from home with emphasis on sleep.

A bit like being next to a bee hive but far louder. The bed it is dangerous why. because it has solid wood hard edged overhangs sticking out under the mattress in just the right position to bang your leg and I did as did many others I spoke to.

The toast is only toasted on one side. the list could go on. You get far better in the average bed and breakfast at a quarter of the price.

And it must be a mass hallucination too given the number of other people telling me about their similar experience. This hotel may score highly on a paper based assessment of facilities but when it comes down to the basics it is a 2 star experience for hundreds of guests as is reflected in the 500 who have given it a poor or terrible rating.

Stayed during the coronavirus outbreak very clean and tidy plenty of soap and hand sanitizer. We were not worried at all. Great friendly service with room service and at check out letting us leave our luggage with you for the day. Easy to get taxi outside. Lovely comfy beds and nice view. Great atmosphere in the bar in the evening. First stay in Manchester and even though our coronation Street tour was cancelled due to virus the hotel and our experience made up for it. We will return and will recommend to others thank you.", "offset": [377, 516], "date": "2020-03-15", "cpt": "2", "category": "atmosphere"}]}
