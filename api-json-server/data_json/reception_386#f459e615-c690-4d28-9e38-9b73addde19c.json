Read some reviews post check in and was scared for safety. Room was advertised as modern and renovated. Staff would not give discount. If I had of checked in earlier I would have demanded a refund and moved hotels. Never have a seen a more disgusting hotel. Was told it was a cheap room so I did not needs refund by staff.

Yes I understand were in January but we are in California it is not even raining or cold outside. On top of that the hotel was under construction. We got woken up at 6 in the morning every morning. It was horrible. The only thing that I liked that we were close to downtown.

Stayed here this past week and let me start by saying they are under a full scale renovation. I stayed in one of the newly renovated room which on the surface was not bad. The overall room size is not bad but the bathroom is ridiculously undersized. Housekeeping kept up on the room pretty well but the rest of the hotel was a mess. The area where the hotel is located is not the best several times during my stay I witnessed people come from off the street and use the ice machine and walk back out. The staff outside of one lady was completely rude and useless. I made several calls about marijuana being smoked in one of the rooms to the right and left of me and nothing was done. I watched the valet get into an actual physical altercation with a gentleman about the valet striking his window. On top of all that if you have a vehicle you have to valet it for 30 a night. Also you have to put down a 50 deposit for every night you stay which you will get back in 2 7 business days.
