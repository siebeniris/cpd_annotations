The rooms are large and bright sunny if the sun is out. The dressing room with the built in seat is luxurious compared to the competition. The staff is very accommodating and gracious needed a dozen long stem red roses in half an hour on a Friday afternoon and the concierge made it happen. Nothing is a problem well except for maybe the Ty Bar. This newly renovated part of the lobby in red velvet looks totally inappropriate with the quality of the rest of the architecture and decor. The way the tables are lined up makes it look like a glorified cafeteria but the service was still excellent. And after enough drinks well you know.", "offset": [452, 592], "date": "2015-01-27", "cpt": "0", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "871d64fd-4c8f-417c-8009-bb90a61a2e7b", "sentence": "World Class. The Four Seasons take customer service to another levelOn checking in at the Four Seasons I asked if I could have a high level room to escape the road noise which had kept me awake on my last visit to the city. After a brief wait I was offered a room on 49th floor with views to die for. It was a newly refurbished floor and I was warned there might be one of 2 snagging items which there were. I reported them and not only were they fixed immediately but I received a hand written apology note from the head housekeeper. The concierges were brilliant. especially Tina the doormen great at transporting shopping to my room. I could go on. The hotels location is also first class.

Stayed in April business meeting. Location is great easy to get anywhere. Kind of a weird set up where upon entry you see concierge bar restaurant but have to ask for check in spot which is hidden up the stairs to the side of elevators. Mind you there is staff around to direct you but still found it unusual. Biggest beef is with elevators 1 set serves lower floors 1 serves higher which I assume are more expensive. The result is that lower floor guests have to line up and wait sometimes 5 minutes happened to me to get on while the other bank of elevators was moving up and down with what seemed like blazing speed. The deluxe city view room turned out to look out at building under renovations with construction light left on all night an annoyance for someone who likes to sleep with blinds open. Make sure you confirm what the fancy name room really gets you before you book. And double check instruction given by the front desk asked for a specific meeting room got sent in a completely different direction. Really. Staff does not know where the meeting rooms are. So enjoyed the location in NYC bar was really good food was great but left wanting given Four Seasons name.

My wife and I celebrated her birthday by spending a couple of days in New York to take in a play and dine in a couple of nice restaurants. The Four Seasons is centrally located to very nice museums and restaurants and is really not too far from Broadway to walk. Given traffic conditions in the city these days we found walking back from the play to be almost as quick as taking the taxi to the play and less stressful. Our room was very large with excellent closet space and a nice sitting area. Traffic noise was minimal. The hotel is in the midst of updating its rooms. The carpet in ours was a bit threadbare with seam gaps. You may want to want until later in the year when the refresh is complete. The basic wifi that was included in our room rate was very slow. On our first afternoon the hotel surprised my wife with a wonderful chocolate cake. That was a very nice touch. We found every member of the staff to be terrific especially Bety and Milton who work in their restaurant.", "offset": [660, 734], "date": "2015-06-13", "cpt": "0", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 4, "uid": "735521da-195c-43db-b48b-53ebca8b0577", "sentence": "Great service but expensive for what it is. I stayed at the FS NYC while I hosted a conference there. Overall service was outstanding as you would expect. Additionally the function space was great we used the Fifty7 ballroom the old bar. and it was a great space. Food was excellent etc. As for the rooms the bottom line is that you can stay at any number of hotels in the area and have rooms that are larger and nicer for half the price. Now in fairness my room 3408 was a closet with windows. it was tiny. But the rooms are just a little tired and bland and in need of upgrade. And my 14 TV do they really still make TVs that size which I think was circa 200 was across the really small room from my bed and impossible to see. Along those lines the place could use a technological update. TVs are old there are a scarcity of plugs etc. Anyway I enjoyed my stay and the rooms are nice enough but unles you are just a Four Seasons junkie you could have a nicer room down the block or around the corner for half the price.", "offset": [729, 790], "date": "2015-11-05", "cpt": "0", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 5, "uid": "324b1bdb-d5ac-4257-87f2-0b935bb32f4e", "sentence": "Four Seasons revisited. The Four Seasons still seems to nail it in a way that most other hotels do not. Lots of reviewers talk about the friendliness of the staff which for me has always been a bit of a stretch. I do not stay in hotels to make new friends with the people who work there so does friendliness really matter. On reflection and having stayed at two hotels on this visit Baccarat was the other the contrast is stark. At the Four Seasons they really do seem pleased to have you there and this makes up for rooms which are now not so much tired as plain exhausted. To my shock there was actually stuffing coming out of the chair in our room. Not good at 140 a night. However the big smiles and the view the view. really do make up for a lot. If you are not interested in a view then a lot of what this hotel has to offer evaporates somewhat. If you are overlooking the light well then you could save some money and go elsewhere. But if you want the iconic Manhattan view and what tourist would not then there is still simply nowhere else to stay but here.

I am a devoted customer of the Four Seasons NYC and stay there around 20 nights every year. In many ways this is a great hotel the location is superb the service is friendly and efficient the rooms are very large for NYC with soaring ceilings nice TVs and good bathrooms with good shower pressure a personal pet peeve. The gym is small but well equipped and the spa is quite nice. These are many of the reasons I return frequently. This hotel however is beginning to lose its competitive edge in room quality and in certain aspects of its service at the price range it operates. As other premier properties have opened in NYC one expects more from a hotel that still charges anywhere from 70 to 110 per night for their entry level room. Here is the list of my specific isues The room decor is showing its age. Furniture and carpets were worn in my room and that is true in the other rooms I stayed. Overall the hotel needs to refresh its rooms beyond just switching the TV sets which it upgraded. These rooms have not changed in the 12 years I have stayed there Though the bathrooms are nice hotels at this level should offer two sinks. that is not available anywhere in the hotel including some large suites I have stayed at The failure to provide water at turn down is odd at this price range The room service is terrific for breakfast but the lunch and particularly dinner choices are tired and are made at mediocre quality. This is particularly disappointing given stratospheric room service prices. I recall an advertising campaign for the hotel a few years ago boasting sushi at midnight. That was just advertising no such option exists on the menu which is fine if there were other good options Hotel badly needs more restaurant options. It no longer offers proper dinner service anywhere. In the evening all you have is the limited menu at the lounge which does not take reservation is often very crowded and sometimes will play baseball football games on the big screen. Hardly the atmosphere approach you expect at the Four Seasons Eliminating the large bar in the back of the hotel was a terrible decision. Really hurts the options that hotel guests have The doorman are very inconsistent. In the middle of the day there are many everywhere. But good luck arriving at 1 am when only the 57th entrance is open. You will not find anyone. Again this is still a great hotel but grading on a curve it is increasingly not measuring up. I am a fan and have generally stayed loyal but when I see the rooms reviews of other top NYC hotels I keep being tempted to try them. The Four Seasons should work a lot harder to regain its edge as the top hotel in NYC.", "offset": [952, 1049], "date": "2015-12-13", "cpt": "0", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 8, "uid": "dac08fd6-ccda-4ffe-85b8-f1492927a0a5", "sentence": "Nothing Special.

The only downsides are that they gouge you for fast wi fi 25 day when you have paid 110 a night for a room.
