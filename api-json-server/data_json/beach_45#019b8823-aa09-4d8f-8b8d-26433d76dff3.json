We stayed at few Waldorf In Italy Rome in Orlando and it was the best of the best but this hotel is like if you will stay at a motel. Before I booked it I red tall he review and thought that people were somehow exaggerated and kind of demanding on their complains. But because of the Waldorf name I decided to still book our stay here. Now people at front desk are very nice and it seems they are very well trained to people constant complains and. The fact that this hotel have a private beach is definitely a plus. All the rest is simply unacceptable. The hotel is dirty the walls need serious painting the floors are in unacceptable shape and the rooms are smelly and dirty see pictures. The bed and pillows are not comfortable and the bathrooms are not in good shape neither. We felt like if we were staying in a cheap motel and did not want to be the difficult people and decide to spend the 1st night there because we were tired of our full day traveling and driving to Key West. In the morning we notified the manager we were not comfortable and she offered a different room saying that it will be a very cleaned room. I was disappointed to know that one room may be cleaner that others. Overall I think it was the all ambiance that simply did not make it for us. I can not be tire to say we felt like staying at a motel and not at a Waldorf Hotel.

We have been visiting Key West regularly for the last 10 years or so and used to stay at a different hotel but last year we tried The Reach a Waldorf Astoria Resort for the first time. We loved it so much we returned this year and I am doing what I should have done last year telling everyone about it. This oceanfront hotel is on the south end of Key West an easy 2 minute walk to Duval St Perfect location easy to get to the fun of Duval but beautiful and quiet once we return. All the staff is awesome so friendly and helpful. Our room was perfect and had a wonderful balcony with a beautiful view of the ocean. There is also a large oceanfront balcony for all the guests to use on the second floor a perfect place to sit and relax in rhe evening. I love the expreso coffee maker with real china cups that we had in our room. We loved having coffee on the balcony in the morning and a glass of wine in the evening overlooking the beautiful blue ocean. There is a lovely pool with bar service. Or next to it is the beach with nice chairs and large umbrellas the staff will put up for you. The restaurant has an open air setting again with a nice ocean view.

We stayed at the Reach for four nights during our kids spring break. The location is excellent for families as it is close to Duval street the quieter end and easy walking distance to most sites and restaurants. Overall we had a great experience. If returning to Key West I would stay this hotel again. Before getting into the details I should say that I thought I booked the Casa Marina the Reachs sister hotel basically a block away. The Casa Marina is larger and seemed to have more children. That said I really liked the Reach for the lack of chaos and it is beach. You can use the facilities at either hotel. Pros 1 Absolutely fantastic staff. They could not have been more helpful or polite. The staff make the experience. 2. Location the proximity to Old Town with a beach is hard to come by in Key West. The beach is quite lovely and very swimable. There are wonderful hammocks in which one can relax. 3 Access to water activities we went on a fantastic jet ski tour right out of the hotel. We only had four jet skis on the tour. some of the off site tours had 10 boats or more. It was a great way to see the island and the kids had a blast. They also have paddle boards kayaks and hobie cats for rent. 4. Quiet low key the hotel was low key. Plenty of families and couples but not a big partiyng crowd. They have a giant chess set and a bocce ball court. OK1 fitness center is small but functional. They stock it with water bottles which is nice. 2. Gift shop is small with limited stock but you can get coffee lattes in the morning. 3 Rooms were clean but not particularly luxurious for a luxury hotel. 4 pool is small but nice to sit around. Cons 1. All cars must be valet parked. 2. Hotel rooms are small this probably was the biggest negative for us. They advertise the double rooms as best for families of four. I will say that we felt very cramped. The beds are double beds. To me double beds are suitable for two small children period not for adults or teenage children. There are no rolaways available and one would not fit if you could get it. The bathroom was tiny. To truly be comfortable a family of four probably needs to have two rooms. There are larger studio rooms but they have a king bed and a sleeper sofa which is never a selling point to me. they tend to be horribly uncomfortable. 3. Food. the restaurant food was ok never great. The prices are typical hotel prices. We ate there for breakfast and lunch a couple of times and had room service once. They did cook up the fish we caught for 20 per person. Given the preponderance of restaurants in close proximity it really is not necessary to eat there at all. That said it would have been nice to have had better quality food available. 4. the hotel is expensive Many of the reviews have mentioned the price for the overall quality of the hotel. At well over 500 night with taxes resort fees and parking the facility itself does not meet the standard of luxury hotel in my experience. You are paying for the excellent location and access to Old Town. Overall we have a lovely time at The Reach. I can not say enough about the staff. Without that element I might have been more disappointed in the hotelBTW if you like coffee there is a coffee stand at the end of the block with the best cafe con leche note that the sign says open from 7 3 Monday thru Saturday. they were never open by 7usualy by 730and they never opened at all on Saturday.

I can not believe how much revenue they are leaving behind with such poor service. The music at the bar is much too loud and the guy talked about himself more than playing. Several days we were left with incomplete linens and a call went unanswered. The beach seating ran out of umbrellas and towels.

EJ informed me that there were 3 hotel rooms that had be renovated and they were demo rooms for the upcoming renovation starting in August.

The Reach is located right next to the Southern Most Point. A few steps from the hotel starts Duval street which is only a mile long. Great location.

This is a big draw since most of the resorts only have pools or beach chairs on decks docks with no sand or beach access.

My husband and I just returned from a Valentine Birthday long weekend and we were so pleased with the Reach. We stayed at the Casa Marina last May and loved it but knew it had not been renovated so decided to try the Reach. It \u2019s smaller than the Casa which was appealing too. We loved almost everything about it seems our experience was very different from that of some other reviewers. We had a resort view room on the top floor and it was extremely quiet. Nicely decorated with a decently sized bathroom. Large shower and plenty of counter space. Housekeeping was efficient never had an issue. Large balcony with nice view of the grounds. We had no issue with the AC. Beach is GREAT and that \u2019s where we spent our days. Beach service the hard working Jese especially is fantastic. chairs and umbrellas are plentiful and you ca n\u2019t beat the views. We do think the beach drink and food service needs to be stepped up. The servers are very nice and do their best but there just are n\u2019t enough of them. The restaurant is absolutely the best. everything we ate was delicious from the eggs and sausage at breakfast to the burgers wings and shrimp flatbread at lunch to the grouper at dinner. We were blown away but do wish they offered room service. Service was a tad slow but worth it and everyone who works there is so very nice and efficient. Bar is beautiful and drinks were perfect although the bartenders need to make the Casa \u2019s Key Lime Colada my favorite of all timePublic bathrooms are convenient pool is nice gift shop is lovely location is perfect. the one negative are the elevators. The one on the far end of the resort was out of service and had been with no indication of when or if it would be fixed and the two near the lobby were creaky slow and not trustworthy. Our last day they refused to go to the 5th floor. Made us uncomfortable and really something needs to be done. While this is an expensive place with a 45 resort fee plus all the exorbitant Florida taxes we loved it and will be back hopefully annually.
