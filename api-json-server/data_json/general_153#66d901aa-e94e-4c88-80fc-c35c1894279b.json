Stayed for 3 nights and days at the end of 11 day trip to japan for vacation. Took Shinkansen from Nagoya to Tokyo Station 23 hours. Hotel is in Minato district near Ropongi and Shibuya districts both worth seeing. We stayed in main building 5th floor. Its about a 20 taxi fare from Tokyo Station. If you have luggage take a taxi not the subway. American Embassy is literally right behind hotel. did not need it but went to take a picture then realized it might not be allowed. It was not. The hotel staff and lobby staff were all excellent 5 stars. Check in and bell staff truly awesome. No tipping in Japan gifts are OK. so we offered chocolates to our room bellhop. They were gladly accepted. Rooms were adjoining and made the stay very pleasant. Rooms were very big for Japan hotels and our 3 teenagers had plenty of room and comfort in their room. Very clean everywhere. Bathroom spacious and fully enclosed shower was fantastic. No room safe though. Beds were very comfortable. Finally 2 pillows per person. There was a room fridge that was the mini bar. we did not buy anything but moved stuff around and used it for storage. Tip in Winter if too warm open the sliding shutters in front of windows found in every hotel in japan we stayed in. Also that space cools off hot beverages or items you want to keep cold if fridge is too full. Room temp was fine and adjustable but adjustments not noticeable right away. Transportation around Tokyo from hotel was taxis and there were always taxis available and door staff always on top of hailing one for you. and we had 5 adults travelling so we needed 2 taxis always. Tip take a picture of your destination written in Japanese and show it to drivers it saves time. Take cards form lobby desk to show for return to hotel. Taxis very clean and drivers very efficient. never had a single problem in destination or charges in 6 trips. Subways are about 10 15 minute walk from hotel depending on station choice. We had enough of crowded subways after 8 days. Food we ate at 2 in hotel restaurants and they were both very very very expensive and portions were very small and at one food was below average. I recommend you look into eating out in Ropangi or Shibuya districts. about 9 15 dollar ride one way. I reviewed the 2 restaurants separately. Free wifi was easy to use and strong. In room hot water kettle and free bottle of water for kettle each day was nice touch. Had to ask for coffee packets and creamer each day as housecleaning took them away each day. Breakfast buffet was 34 per person which we avoided so we stopped in at their terrace cafe front section and bought pastries every day while there. Much less expensive and really quite good bacon ham bread french bread they will slice for you too vanilla scones chocolate croissants etc. There is a 7 11 about 5 minute walk away if needed for bottled water diet cokes etc and a McDonanlds about 8 minutes away if needed. Concierge was at Ast manager desk in Lobby. Very helpful. Use them to get reservations for dining in house since we called restaurants directly and were told no available room. That changed quickly when we used concierge. Its an Amercian thing. I suggest reading up on the dim view of Americans among Japanese. Whether right or wrong deserved or not it helps you focus on your task at hand not the manner in which you are greeted treated. There was a Gallery of shops on the first floor of the main building called the Arcade of Shops. Just so very expensive so we decided to skip them as well. Cigar shop was awesome but again expensive. 270 yen 25 for a 10 Monte Cristo cigar plus tax. If food was more reasonably priced and rooms just a bit bigger this would be a 5circle hotel. Still a solid 4circle hotel which we were very thankful to have stayed in.", "offset": [3213, 3278], "date": "2015-01-10 00:00:00", "cpt": "0", "category": "general"}, {"id": 2, "uid": "b60b68cf-9bf6-40e5-925c-e1aad2cf0596", "sentence": "It was certainly a marvellous hotel.

We stayed for 9 nights in the main building regular room. My intention was to book somewhere with a taste of Japanese history so we avoided the Hilton hotels for example. Before you walk in you can see the beautiful structure of the hotel. We were welcomed inside with assistance with our bags and very friendly service. Checking in was no problem and we were guided to our room. Although there was somewhat of a language barrier it was not impossible. Women wearing kimonos hold open the lift for you and bow before the doors close something entirely new to me. I was very pleased with the attention to detail in the room. The bed was perfectly made the sides were dust free and the window had a fantastic view. The carpet however was silently darkened with dirt but that was a minor detail. The Bathroom was fantastic the shower is incredibly spacious with plenty of room. The maid service was also very efficient. They explained to us that they would clean our room at any point of the day if we request it not just at a specific time. Absolutely no problems with the room at all. It was a slight disappointment with the breakfast we had. It was a buffet for around 320 yen. the selection was lacking with food ranging from dry toast to undercoked egg. it is something I would expect to be included with the price of the room at least. The hotel does however offer a wide range of spa treatments and additional services if you can spear the extra buck. And try to explore the hotel if you can. you will find the overall experience of the hotel is definitely worth a visit from the ambience of the lobby to the view you will see from your window.

The concierge was super helpful in directing me to file a police station where more English spoken and even helped to write a note in Japanese. The bummer kicked in when I called Amex to cancel my card. And Amex offered to arrange with the hotel to advance me cash it is apparently a service offered by Amex with 5star hotels with Amexs underwriting. Hotel Okura flatly refused. Instead they asked me to go to the ATM at their hotel to withdraw cash. It was an oxymoron suggestion because my card is no longer with me. The level of service is always tested and stretched in a crisis. In this case I was totally not impressed with Hotel Okura. Fortunately I have friends in town to help me out. Definitely can not rely on the service provider. CONCLUSIONConsidering the location size the service breakfast it is great value to stay here.
