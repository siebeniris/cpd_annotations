Kitchenette had microwave coffee maker and mini fridge and sink. Was nice as we went to local grocery story just 2 blocks away to get breakfast stuff to keep in kitchen to make mornings leisurely. In separate room which was nice since our teenage daughter slept on pullout couch in living area. Bathroom was very tiny. No room on sink area to keep toiletries. Shower did not have door or shower curtain so the water did spray onto the floor so we had to keep towels on floor so we would not slip on stepping out of the shower. Bedroom was perfect size. Nice size closet. Free safe was nice. We booked on hotel website and got free wifi for all three of us some hotels in area charge for wifi per device. Hotel has free wine happy hour every day but we were never around for that. Did enjoy the hotel restaurant for dinner one night. Service was impeccable. They have a good workout room with treadmills bikes and elliptical machines plus weights. Bring your headphones as the cardio devices has tvs built into them. Yay. Got to give a special shout out to Chiran doorman from Nepal. He was very professional and friendly. When we had to check out at 40 am he arranged the night before a car for us to get to JFK and the car showed up early. Nice touch. Thanks Chiran.

Then we decided to go for a walk and a bite after a long transatlantic travel. Put my belongings in the safety box just to realise that the battery of the safety box was out. Informed the reception and the maintenance came nicely in less than 10min. The maintenance guy did probably his absolute best but could n\u2019t find a solution in 1hr and after three different stints into our room. Then the maintenance guy came with a portable safety box not bolted into the wall as the original one and as safety boxes usually are. I did n\u2019t really like the idea of a portable one and went then to reception to discuss alternative solutions. I told the receptionistdiferent one that did the check in about the matter but she was not willing to understand why I did n\u2019t like the portable safety box as \u201d. how do you think that anybody could access the room \u201d. Obviously that is highly unlikely but is n\u2019t the safety box totally useless in the first place then. I just want to have my passports etc. safe and the insurance company probably does n\u2019t like me if something happens and I did n\u2019t utilize a proper safety box. Receptionist still refused to understand me \u201d I do n\u2019t understand what you are saying \u201d at this point I have to mention that even though not being a native english speaker I consider my level of English being perfectly sufficient and something I use everyday professionally. Finally I asked what we should do about this matter and she said \u201d I can not help you a manager is here in 15min and will have more authority \u201d. At this stage we had lost 15 2hrs of time in New York and it \u2019s safe to say that the being awake for 2hr did n\u2019t help my frustration levels. I then asked if we could just do a room move to make an easy solution and the receptionist did that right away. I just do n\u2019t get why she did n\u2019t have any willingness to suggest anything herself apart from speaking with a manager. Machines do n\u2019t sometimes work and that \u2019s absolutely fine and it \u2019s nobodys fault. Also there was nothing wrong with the room as such so I do n\u2019t get why she was n\u2019t interested in helping me. Frankly all I just waited to hear was to have a room move but ultimately had to request it myself. Got the new room and everything was fine. This was probably the most ridiculous 2hrs I \u2019ve spent that would have been easily taken care of in matter of minutes in the first place. As I said things sometimes break and that \u2019s absolutely fine it \u2019s really what we do about it what matters. Also a \u201d sorry \u201d or similar from the staff would n\u2019t have been wrong either. I encountered the same staff member again the next day as our keys stopped working and she was still reluctant of any basic customer service skills. I \u2019m super guted that one member of staff can ruin the whole customer service of this property in my eyes. On the checkout day there were other personnel and they were as friendly as ever and throughout the stay the other personel were superb. Cleaning was neat everything absolutely fine. Coming back to NY at somepoint and still 5050 if I can give this property a new chance.
