Had a great stay at this hotel. Booked a room with a small kitchenette so we could make fresh tea and coffee the room was huge with two queen beds which were very comfy and made sleeping to real pleasure after hard days sightseeing. They had a fantastic rooftop terrace where you could see the Chrysler building one way and Empire state building the other way so a great central location couple blocks from Macys and 1520 mins walk to Times square. It was a fairly quiet area which we wanted itself a rarity in New York but close enough to all the buzz if you want. There was a great little diner across the road called Scotys which did great breakfast lunch and dinner at affordable prices. It was also friendly and quite interesting to see the comings and goings there many locals used it.

I am a New Yorker that lives in London now and I have been staying at the Shelburne for almost 20 years. It was an apartment hotel when I first stayed there offering a kitchenette in many of its room. they have modernized in recent years and that is no longer available. Although some of the suites have a kitchen area with microwave small fridge kettle crockery and cutlery which is great if you are there for a long stay. The hotel is very trendy now with nice decor in the rooms. Beds are big and comfortable with choice of pillow type. All rooms have a small fridge. Bathrooms are nice and clean and prettier than they used to be. The only thing I wish they had not changed was the small toiletries they offered. They were good quality but now they have pump dispensers in the showers which are not as good. Any issues with your room are resolved asap. The employees are extremely friendly and helpful and there is pretty much nothing they would not do to make you feel at home. Some of the employees have been there for as long as I have been going there. I think that speaks volumes for the management. Room service is good. The Shelburne has a great burger restaurant called RARE on site and have an amazing outdoor bar lounge on the roof which is very popular especially with young city professionals. there is a small gym that is got most of what you need for a decent workout during your stay. Running machines stair masters bikes weights mats water towels and TV. Another criticism is that I have not been happy in the last few years that they charge for wifi daily. Movies are also expensive but I think that is the same in many of the better hotels. it is not an inexpensive hotel although you can get some pretty good deals at various times during the year. The location is Murray Hill which is a great neighborhood. Safe full of restaurants bars shops and close to a major subway stop Grand Central. you are a hop skip and a jump from many of the places you had like to visit. it is pretty central without being an overly busy area.

Nothing really as it continues to be a headache having stayed here. Though granted I arrived quite late checking in around 2 am that does not justify the empty lobby and staff less front desk that I encountered. Nor would it justify the I will be right there just wait that was shouted from some unknown inner sanctity that I was not privy to. Then issue finding the reservation. Ah got it but they did not put the price of the room on it. I gave him the information and he proceeded to add taxes and add ons already included in the price which I pointed out. They never show the full price I have been handling reservations from them for years. So I pulled up the confirmation on my phone and let him read for himself that all was included. Nonetheless he did some odd math and put in a price that was not the actual price. And days later when I checked my credit card statement to find a still higher price I called and spoke to another person at the front desk who stumbled around awkward explanations and phantom reservation confirmations only to have him abruptly end the call announcing he had found the information and would credit my account for the overcharge. And I did receive a nominal credit again that has nothing to do with reality which I will follow up on after finishing this review.", "offset": [831, 913], "date": "2017-02-10", "cpt": "1", "category": "price"}, {"id": 12, "uid": "2f5e9b8a-9626-49d4-ad7f-2fb89ffc2c03", "sentence": "Location location location. The hotel is well placed for walking to Grand Central 5 10 mins the subway 5 10 mins Time Square 5 10 mins etc. Staff are definitely pleasant and helpful. Rooms are definitely spacious and well appointed but are looking a little tired. Obviously fixtures fittings walls doors etc get battered every day by guests who have no respect but there could be an opportunity for a paint job coming up. Cleanliness in our room was definitely an issue. Bathroom door had to be cleaned by me as it looked like excrement andor some juice was all over the interior. These are the fine points which differentiates one hotel from another attention to detail. This includes making sure the clock is set to the current time which I did myself having found the adjustment on the back making sure the lights all work not taking towels for cleaning which are not left on the floor environmental responsibility card in the bathroom stipulates this cleaning the fridge etc. Those guests with an eye for detail will pick up on this. Sadly the most disappointing part of our stay is the outdated archaic practice of charging the 25tax resort fee. Seriously this has to stop. it is 2017. Levying a charge for wi fi and the gym is like levying a charge for electricity. As for providing a 10 credit for snacks drinks it is absurd and frankly insulting to human intelligence to charge such OUTRAGEOUS prices. This practice should be illegal and most of the reviews for the hotel mention this as a negative point. It would be preferable to abandon the free wine hour in favor of removing this resort fee. If you truly think you are a resort then provide water fountains with recyclable cups which would elevate your reputation for not taking advantage of your guests by charging 25tax and offering a bottle of water for 10. Really this is a practice out of the dark ages. Your management needs to wake up and take note. it is 2017. If your guests continue to be gullible and think 25 represents value for money lucky for you but bad karma for taking advantage.", "offset": [1272, 1409], "date": "2017-02-14 00:00:00", "cpt": "1", "category": "price"}, {"id": 13, "uid": "9c4f72b8-711f-4be5-8d91-9cf90ad0d113", "sentence": "Walking distance to everything but still quiet so you can sleep.

Our room had a small kitchenette with a fridge which meant we could buy milk and keep our drinks coldthere is only a coffee machine no kettle if you want tea. There are a lot of taxes and extra charges including a 25 a night service charge which really add up so make sure you take this into account when deciding if it is within your budget. They have an odd service where you get 10 a day as part of the service charge to spend at their shop which is just a small selection of overpriced snacks and drinks. a bottle of water uses up your entire allowance.

We are very happy that Su Mui from the Dumont is now at the Shelburne and she has been very kind and helpful. We were also delighted that Karen Medina is now back with Afinia and it was so nice to see her unexpectedly at the front desk the evening we checked in. Our room was quite good size and the bathroom was nice. The air conditioning system did not work very well and it seems like these need to be updated. One thing that constantly bothers us is the facilities fee. To a large extent we really do not drink and we are generally working or otherwise busy and would not attend the wine reception. We do not generally use the gym. And we do not really need wifi. This essentially means the 40 with tax. we is going to a 10 pantry credit which one can use to get a bottle of water that might normally be 2. I strongly encourage you to find a different paradigm in this regard. Although we really like the Afinia chain and some of the staff a great deal we have no particular interest in subsidizing other peoples wine reception etc. Part of what is bothersome is that the way it is done seems disingenuous. We would rather see the room be 40 more up front when looking at pricing than to see a low rate and then be reminded that it is really plus 40 per night for items that might appeal to some people but not to us. Perhaps you could give people the option of attending the wine reception using the gym using wifi and getting a 10 pantry credit in a package for 20 or 30 and simply charge an extra 10 or 20 across the board. Personally speaking we would rather have a room price 20 higher with the option of paying an extra 20 for the facilities package which we would not do than to pay 40 so other people can have wine and other things we do not want.
