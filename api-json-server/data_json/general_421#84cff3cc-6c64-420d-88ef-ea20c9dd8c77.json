We have just returned from two fabulous weeks at the house 1115 15115 a true home from home that even has it \u2019s own very friendly cat named Ginger. The service provided by all the staff Andrew Agnes Teddy Christopher Jefferson and the rest of the team is second to none. They simply ca n\u2019t do enough to make your stay as relaxing and enjoyable as possible. As far as I am concerned the whole experience was fantastic and I can see no justification for some of the negative comments on this site. Although all guests stay B B the staff regularly serve bottled water fresh fruit cold towels ice cream and drinks to guests relaxing in their luxurious sun beds on the beach or by the pool. The cooking and wine tasting demos and afternoon tea are also nice treat and a bit of relief from the baking sunshine. If I could offer any advice to anyone considering Barbados it would be to stay at the House and book some meals with some of the top restaurants before departing from the UK. If you do n\u2019t it can be difficult to get a reservation and an ocean view table. I can highly recommend Sandy Lane if you have deep pockets the Cliff and Lone Star. All of these are good for Star Spotting on the island. Equally good is the Fish Pot Champers and Zen. I would love to visit the House again. If you decide to book please keep a look out for Ginger as she the true star of the island.", "offset": [1104, 1187], "date": "2015-01-16", "cpt": "0", "category": "general"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "cac2f027-76a2-44b8-af22-4291cbca3110", "sentence": "Very enjoyable holiday. Recently returned from the House and had a lovely time there. We had an ocean front top floor room and it was lovely amazing views very clean and had a comfy bed. One criticism of the room was having the air con unit by the bed. I had to keep pushing the vents downwards and putting the night setting on so it went off after a period of time. By default it pointed at the bed and was too much even on a low setting. The service was generally good a little hit and miss at times maybe. One point I would make is it would be better for the staff to come around the site to take drink orders from you by the pool on the beach and get you to sign for them when they bring them to you rather that having to go to the bar and they then turn around and say we will bring the drink to you. I have had this service in other hotels around the world and it worked well and was more pampering. The breakfast was not so great I have had far better in lesser class of hotel. Often the sausages and bacon etc were cold regardless of the time you arrived to eat. I did raise this on one occasion but nothing was done to remedy the problem. It was a lovely area to sit and eat your meal though and very peaceful. The ambassadors were really good for booking restaurants taxis etc though. The cooking demos by the chef from Daphnes were good fun and would recommend attending. Free Wi fi was good in the room and the grounds.

Oh what bliss. We have been here for the last 12 days and almost time to go home. I think the best holiday everFrom the outside you do not see much but a wall with an arch but if you go inside it is an open lounge with white sofas and colourful cushions with an amazing view of the sea. The staff is friendly knowledgeable professional and have a can do attitude at all times. They bring little surprises to the beach or swimming pool such as fruit ice cream water cold towels etc. The sunloungers are thick cushions and wide so relaxing. Never a shortage of loungers or towels. Breakfast is included. Lovely fruits and a fresh station of order what you like eggs. Breakfast is not my favourite meal of the day so I try not to eat much. My husband loves the omelettes. Some of the items I felt was a bit dry by the time we get to eat if I want to nie honest like the hash browns and pancakes. but they have a variety everyday and make changes. You can have champagne as well if you like. The staff or ambassadors as they are called make suggestions and bookings at restaurants. Ambassadors to mention are Alana Anthony Christopher Charles Kery Ricardo Richard Wade. but really all of them. Always polite and smiling so different to some other sister hotels we visited to have a look. Must mention the Tamarind next door also have some very helpful and friendly staff. We had so much fun with the Water sports. The tubes behind a boat watersking and water taxi are free. We also used the jet skis sofa behind a boat with some great friends we met here. That was at a charge. You can negotiate a bit on these some times. We mostly paid in Barbados dollars however they often quote Amercican dollars. 3 BD to the pound and 2 to BDWe chose a junior suite with ocean view and it was perfect. Spacious room with a sitting area. Gorgeous view from the balcony. His and hers basins with Elemis toiletries and turndown service every night. There are so many special things such as lavender spray for the pillows cookies every night. Oh and they do an afternoon tea which you should not have when you go to one of the lovely restaurants for dinner. We normally just opted for the coffee or tea. But there were always scones or cakes and small buns rolls with some savoury filling. We mostly ate at The House lunch times. They get their food from Daphnes next door but a shorter version of the menu delicious salads or light bites. It is truly a gastronomic experience everywhere. Not sure if I have a chance to mention the restaurants later but must mention Daphnes Cliff Beach club The Cliff Tides and Scarlet. Food and ambience GREAT. Prices are not cheap in Barbados but you eat well. Spa treatments you get outside in a corner with the sound of the placid waves in the background. Shena is a very good maseus. We went on a private tour with Paul Payne from Paynes Taxis. A very nice minibus air conditioned of course and he took us all over the island and did what we wanted. He was very knowledgeable and stopped where we wanted to stop and we got a very good overview of the island. Also told us about some restaurants very informative in all aspects. The sea has some rocky bits as you enter and you might want to bring sea shoes or swim over it. We kept saying it is like bath water. Once in you do not want to get out same with the pools. It is a very hot and humid time and we had a few showers but it did not last for long except for one day. But then it is also a very quiet time. This is one place we will definitely return to. We loved the adults only factor but also have holidays with our family and will have to choose another place in that case. I will compare every other place with this now. We travel a lot and are always flexible and I research a lot but this was spot on and we will definitely return hopefully next year.

We came here for 6 nights on our first visit to Barbados. We chose this hotel due to the positive reviews and the small size. On the first night we met the GM Sandra and Andrea the spa manager. We were in a polside room which we found very convenient for beach access though the back door does not lock from the outside. During the first day I went to make a coffee with the espresso machine and found one of the creamers had actually been used but put back in the tea wooden box and the leftover creamer had actually turned hard and yellow so I am not sure how long it had been sitting there before we arrived. That was definitely off putting something to note for housekeeping. Room service and turn down daily was efficient. We never had to wait around for them. Breakfast was good what you had expect from a general buffet breakfast. Everything is repeated with a small variant each day. Champagne on offer was a nice touch. We utilised some of the afternoon tea on some days and canap\u00e9s on Tuesday night as well which was all very nice. During the day if you spend it on the beach the Ambassadors will come around with fruit and ice cream. Service from the Ambassadors were great. they are always friendly and on top of everything. I can not fault them whatsoever. I really liked their professionalism and attentiveness. Agnes is hilarious. We had dinner one night at Daphnes which is linked to the hotel. Again good attentive wait staff and the kitchen service was speedy. It is on the pricier side. Water sports was a great way to break up our day and try something new. We tried watersking for the first time. The guys at the shack will give you a brief training if you havet done something before so it is open to all levels. We missed out on two days of motorised water sports as we went to book late morning for the following day they only let you book the day before. So it is best to get in early if you can. Not sure how this would work though if you were only staying for one night and did not arrive till the afternoon. Included in our stay was a 30 min per person jet lag massage. We opted to do this in the spa versus in our room or in the yoga pavilion. The treatment was relaxing. The spa pool is very small though. I read in the brochure to allow time to swim in it after your treatment but we decided otherwise when we saw it. However wifi throughout the property was terrible. We could not get a steady or fast connection in the room and connection in the communal areas seemed patchy as well. We hired a car and always had car parking available on site right outside the Daphnes restaurant. The property is also part of a number of hotels in the chain. They offer water taxi services to some of the properties but given we had a child free hotel we opted to stay put. But this service might be good for others who want to hotel hop. The reason I am giving it 4 stars is because we found the room quite dated. The bathtub had chips in it. The bed configuration was two beds put together. It really divot in the middle making it uncomfortable on the back or shoulder. Also we found noise from outside echoed into our room especially in the mornings when they set up cutlery in the lounge room or when they talk to each other in the corridors. This usually started around 630am7am. Perhaps an upstairs room higher rate would have been better for sleeping soundly.

We stayed here for our 27th wedding anniversary. We got married at The Tamarind Hotel next door. 27 years ago on the beach steps but looking at these 2 Hotels we opted for this one as it was adults only and appeared to look luxurious. Our arrival was lovely and we had a warm welcome. We were given a garden room with a plunge pool and large balcony which was nice but it was outdated and not a 5 star standard. The bathroom in particular was long and thin and in much need of modernisation. The rooms were cleaned twice daily and the cleaning team were very friendly and attentive. A criticism is that our room was not cleaned until 3 pm ish each day and again at 8 pm so after returning from the beach to freshen up it was often not made up. The champagne breakfasts were nice just enough variety and fresh eggs cooked to your liking if anyone was around to cook them and the champagne kept coming for those who liked it. The afternoon teas were nice too. Our major concern with the Hotel was the fact it had no dedicated Reception Welcome desk. yes there were Ambassadors around but you had difficulty finding one at times especially breakfast and mid afternoon and had to basically go into the kitchen. Certainly no Ambassador came to make a fuss of us or attend to our needs we had to ring or find one of them. We did see Sandra a few times on arrival the welcome night and a few other occasions she was always chatty and pleasant but returning guests certainly got more personal service which did leave you feeling like a second class visitor. The room where you had breakfast was not really a room it was a walk way under the Hotel to the beach. It had a lovely breeze but was not fine dining and a 5 star hotel should have had a separate room with air con for dining in. The sun beds were a complete let down. all gone by 8 am and saved by people who did not turn up until mid morning. We ended up using the ones at The Tamarind where you could spread out and basically have the pool to yourself. The Hotel did not really have a bar either there was a tiny bar area with aprox 6 seats but not a dedicated area as such. We never saw anyone in the Gym or the library area so this was a waste of a good space. The welcome massage was a let down too we arrived on a Friday and could not be seen until the following Thursday at separate times too a shame and not as advertised. We also felt there was a lack of communication with management and guests some days we got a newsletter but most days we did not. events were very last minute and we never knew about live music nights or cooking nights which was disappointing. We got the bus up and down the coast while we were there and tried all sorts of restaurants from local shacks to fine dining which was lovely. We only ate at Daphnes once and found it to be nice food but lacking in atmosphere and very expensive. Towards the end of the holiday we hired a car for 3 days and explored the Island a lot more and visited the other Elegant Hotels all differing in what they offer. We would not stay here again especially for the prices as charged.

There is no doubt this is a high end hotel on the west coast and in a great location. The staff are fabulous they are very attentive and friendly and can not do enough for you. Our room was spacious and led out direct on to the patio. So why only 45. The property is needing some refurbishment particularly the bathrooms in the rooms. the gym and some redecoration in places but the most signifant factor is the lack of a decent restaurant. The hotel is attached to Daphnes and Daphnes is not up to standard for a 5 star class hotel. Most guests ate elsewhere as the ambiance the choice and quality of the menu and food are limited in Daphnes and simply not worth the money compared to other nearby restaurants. They could also reduce the price and provide a better choice at lunchtime. Whilst this did not detract us from enjoying our stay and returning to the House in future it simply did not reach the heights we have expected and stayed recently at other 5 star resorts. Finally I would like to point out that the beach has suffered in recent years. It is tricky getting in and out of the sea due to broken coral and stones and you need to be very careful not to cut your feet. I accept this may be outwith the control of the hotel but it is certainly a negative. Once in the sea it is warm and magical and the sunsets are beautiful.", "offset": [454, 546], "date": "2019-12-02", "cpt": "1", "category": "general"}, {"id": 15, "uid": "267e93e2-f6f4-45fe-97cd-ca2349fd3a16", "sentence": "Bar staff need to work on the way in which they welcome guests.

We did not check in. We were shown a room in The House after refusing to stay at Treasure beach.

It appeared tired and in dire need of investment.

My wife and I arrived a few days before the New Year and spent a lovely 7 days in an ocean facing suite. While we really did n\u2019t take advantage of the suite \u2019s second room which contained a sitting area it was nice to have the two bathrooms. The breakfast was reliable each day with a choice of breads english muffins bagels toast a good selection of fruit and yogurts as well as a warm food station with bacon sausage pancakes and eggs to order. It definitely looks like folks come down before 8 AM and reserve the chaise on the beach for the day leading to a shortage on sunny days. The room was nice as mentioned. The bathroom showers were just tubs with rain shower heads installed. The showers could certainly use some modernization updating to better match the rest of the accommodations. One of the more annoying things was the large king bed is two mattresses. This made it very uncomfortable if you want to be close to your partner and one of you inevitably ends up in the crevasse. One interesting thing to note is that there is no hot tub. It never even occurred to us to check that first. I love hot tubs and was somewhat sad not to have one available. I suspect this could be a British vs US preference. We also had some difficulty scheduling massages especially a couples massage as it appears that the slots are limited and book out several days in advance. May want to get those booked several days in advance. Overall the experience was quite nice and very relaxing with no significant issues or surprises. The staff was very pleasant and ready to help although I wish they would cruise the beach more frequently to take drink orders. The whole Elegant Resorts being bought by Mariot thing was what most of the guests were discussing although it does n\u2019t seem to have resulted in any material changes yet.

This place came recommended to us it certainly was n\u2019t what it said on the box. We were put in a room with a connecting door which was n\u2019t an issue for the first night as no one was in the connecting rm. this soon changed at around 6 pm the following evening when people arrived with booming levels of voice control and kids yes kids shouting mum dad phone conversations going on ectThe hotel moved us to another rm apparently an upgrade. This was all fine and sorted of which we were grateful. The service and consistency of quality service from staff was very inconsistent. The Ambassadors Andrew Agnes we felt require recommendations to have promotions to management services when Mariot finally take over along with Shane these three people should run and manage this place they would could make this place first class. Between these three staff members they have years of quality experience they know what guests expect they know what is required to improve this place and bring it up to the standard guests are paying for they are on the front line dealing with guests 247 they are experienced professional and most importantly have incredible people skills The general manager we felt was also good but then we witnessed her drunk and drinking taking selfie \u2019s on the beach yes it was New Year \u2019s Eve but when you \u2019re in a professional capacity You Do n\u2019t Do It The place is in desperate need of upgrading a good cleaning and disinfecting we saw a staff member chasing a cockroach around attempting to squash it then we sat down in the dining sitting area to find a dead cockroach on its back this was also a food area The sun lounger issue is just a nightmare we actually got up at 6 am. Every morning this was a necessity as guests were leaving towels on sun beds all day and not actually using them one set of 4 guests actually reserved 8 sun beds whilst other guests could n\u2019t sit on the beach as no sun beds were free. no staff member on duty at the time were prepared to deal with these greedy selfish guests despite the hotel \u2019s policy of no reserving sun beds. A lot of the staff appeared as though they had just given up. Shame would have dealt with this if he was on shift. The food the hotel provides actually comes from Daphnies next door this food is appalling over priced and disgusting again the staff here we felt had just given upAn extremely disappointing place to stay certainly not worth the cost. On saying this we did achieve the relaxing book reading break by a beautiful beach.", "offset": [2088, 2149], "date": "2020-01-08", "cpt": "1", "category": "general"}]}
