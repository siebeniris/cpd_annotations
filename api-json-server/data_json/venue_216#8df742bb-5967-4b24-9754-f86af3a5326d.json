This is certainly a grand property housekeeping management does not however seem to maintain the standards of cleanliness one may be accustomed to at other Four Seasons properties.

I recently held a themed Gala Dinner at the Four Seasons Hotel for 290 people and while the hotel faced some serious challenges in regards to tight time frames for event turnaround they did an incredible job and were incredible hosts. The event staff I dealt with at the hotel were nothing but professional accommodating and easy to work with. The in house AV team AV Partners were also exceptional and nothing was too much trouble. I was always kept in the loop with any changes in detail including any amendments to timings in the service of meals and the food was outstanding. My only small criticisms would be that the elevators are a bit slow and when big groups and cruise ships come in they can take a long time. A few of the rooms could also use a bit of a freshen up but overall I was extremely happy with our choice of venue and would not hesitate to recommend Jacqueline and the team at the Four Seasons if looking for a professional and memorable event venue.

We used valet parking and the service was excellent and reasonably priced for SydneyThe staff at the Awards function were excellent friendly and efficient. The food for the event was the only disappointment. A smoked salmon starter followed by a main of either salmon or steak. I had the steak that was like shoe leather I ca n\u2019t recall a tougher over cooked piece of meat. Other diners had similar issues. A lot of food was returned to the kitchens uneaten. To be fair on the kitchen the time between the start of the event and dinner service was lengthy these timings may not have been communicated to the kitchen. Regardless I am surprised there is not a better system for keeping meals warm rather than one that continues to cook and dry out the food. The food service was a fail for us. A shame.
