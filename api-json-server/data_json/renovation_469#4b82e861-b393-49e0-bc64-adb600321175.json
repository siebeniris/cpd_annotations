As you would expect the service and staff were impeccable. From the moment we arrived I was greeted by name by nearly everyone how they remember it I have no idea. We stayed in an ocean view 1 bdrm villa which had been recently updated. Comfortable bed nicely appointed complimentary bucket of beer indoor outdoor shower small pool covered daybed and lounge sun chairs basically the works. Delicious breakfast buffet or a la carte American and Indonesian offerings. We also enjoyed a late night dinner thru room service and it was delicious. The staff cleaned our sandals sunglasses and seemed genuinely interested in knowing and caring for us. Regrettably there was work being done to renovate another nearby villa and the workers started at 815AM. For construction it was not terribly loud but it was a bit annoying so I mentioned it to General Manager Uday Rao who warmly greeted us the next morning. He apologized and promised to make it right. While the work did start later the next morning it was still too early. By mid day the supervisor called us asking how they could make it right and then immediately offered us 2 complimentary balinese massages scheduled for us the next late morning and a 5PM check out on our last day. The property is gorgeous and located on a quiet bay that is safe for swimming offers a pristine beach and waters and comes with various sports activities paddle boards kayaks.

We had an incredible stay. The staff was great very warm welcoming and super accommodating. The food was amazing at both restaurants and the buffet was fabulous. The property is absolutely beautiful. Loved our villa with private pool and incredible view. Awesome surf instruction and yoga. Attention to detail by staff and management was excellent. They are on top of everything. The room was spotless and just renovated. In the renovation they enclosed one of the outdoor seating areas to make the room larger. The villa suite felt very spacious and open we liked having an interior seating area air conditioned and we still had two great seating areas outside by our pool. I went with a friend of mine. She likes to lounge and I like activity. we both had an amazing time. The grounds are beautiful. It feels very private and so peaceful. Gorgeous flowers fall at your feet from the trees it smells amazing. I almost forgot to mention the cold towels. They are provided for you everytime you turn around. Loved those. We went at a time of year when Bali is pretty hot and humid. the towels were awesome. When you are on the beach you are brought bottled water and cold towels all day. They also come by offering to clean your sunglasses and if you order food from the beach it comes very quickly. great service. We had a chance to visit a couple other hotels and we were so happy we chose the Four Seasons. It is definitely the best.

I have visited Bali for ten years now and have always stayed at The Legian in Seminyak which unfortunately has taken a turn for the worst. After beginning my trip once again at The Legian and being sorely disappointed with the state of affairs both at the hotel and in the new Kuta Seminyak we decided to cut our trip short at The Legian and move to the Four Seasons in Jimbaran a hotel which has always piqued my interest. It is without a doubt the best decision I could have made. The hotel grounds quality of the rooms villas staff food level of service amenities and attention to detail are flawless and will now be our new home away from home in Bali. We stayed in the recently updated Deluxe Villa which features all the modern amenities one could expect from the Four Seasons brand and a five star resort without compromising on the authentic Balinese feel that makes visiting Bali so special. The design of the villas and resort itself is sympathetic to local Balinese design and architecture which is important when visiting a cultural wonderland like Bali. The resort is beautiful impeccably maintained and feels like you have the island of Bali all to yourself which is challenging on an island where overdevelopment is rampant. The beach in front of the hotel is spotless and inviting without the dangerous rips or trash that one finds along the Seminyak beach. A vast array of water sport toys such as paddle boards kayaks and others are supplied by the hotel and the fact that these can be used safely should be welcoming and reassuring to families travelling with children. I certainly would not let my kids in the Seminyak beaches and I m from Australia where dangerous rip tides are common but the calm waters of the bay are so inviting. The spa as well as the many cultural and physical activities on offer are amazing and provide a unique experience of the healing and holistic traditions of Bali. The hotel caters to ALL types of holiday makers. be they families couples groups or singles and with the many pool and beach options everyone can find something to suit their needs. From a late check out to suit your flights departure time to catering to specific dietary requirements the Four Seasons goes above and beyond to ensure your stay is memorable and your every need is catered for. The hotel shop has items that you wo nt find anywhere else at reasonable prices. The dining options are vast and after a week I never felt like I was repeating a meal. It is a truly unique experience staying at the Four Seasons and it is obvious that the staff are genuinely interested in providing lasting and positive memories from your stay with them. The Balinese people are truly the most hospitable people in the world and I feel that the Four Seasons has the best of the best in their employ. On an island where 5 star options for your stay are vast and varied I can confidently recommend the Four Seasons to anyone who is considering a visit to this magical island. So much so that I was compelled to share my experience on TripAdvisor. Credit given where credit due and The Four Seasons Jimbaran is deserving of all praise. My only regret is that we did not stay at the Four Seasons Jimbaran all those years ago when we first visited Bali as I am sure I would have ten years worth of amazing memories from this truly unique and incomparable resort. Well done and many thanks to the residence manager Mr Wirawan for not only maintaining the level of service one comes to expect from Four Seasons but actually surpassing it. He has a great team behind him and Four Seasons should be proud of him and the entire staff for their achievementswe are already planning our return visit to Four Seasons Jimbaran and I implore anyone considering a visit to Bali to come experience the pure joy of a stay at the Four Seasons Resort Bali at Jimbaran Bay. I can assure you it is a decision you will not regret.", "offset": [681, 924], "date": "2016-07-19", "cpt": "0", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 3, "uid": "3880788e-5512-480a-abf6-4b29d0410c78", "sentence": "Fantastic resort.

If you are looking for calmness a beautiful property privacy wonderful staff and superb service. We stayed for 8 days in one of the newly renovated premier villas which completely immersed us in the beautiful Balinese environment and culture. The highlight of the stay the super beautiful staff and the wonderful and personal level of service. the property was great and the staff made the vacation for us. We loved talking with the staff and waiters and learning more about the Balinese culture especially during this week where they were celebrating the Kuningan holy day. What a sweet culture. More on the staff later in the review. At Taman Wantilan we had a late lunch on Friday and one of our servers Ayu Rai gave us a beautiful overview of the holy day coming up the next day. Thank you Ayu. Since we had a bit lengthier stay we were able to cover most of the property from the outside yoga pavilion on the west side of the resort across to the east side and Coconut Grove up to the tennis courts and the fitness center spa and all the pools and restaurants in between. It is beautiful all around the property. Definitely recommend the Sunset Cruise on Jimbaran Bay one of the evenings. We stayed in villa 209 recommend one of these premier villas and the construction that has been mentioned in other reviews was not an issue even at breakfast where the Taman Wantilan restaurant is closer to the renovation area. All of the restaurants were excellent we loved the breakfast buffet each morning with a wide range of cuisines from western through to delicious local Indonesian dishes. Evening cocktails on the Sundara patio music several nights during the week several dinners at Sundara restaurant was a great way to unwind after the long and very challenging days at our villa pool joke. My wife spent afternoons at the spa super nice and the treatments were fabulous for her. she recommends ShantiWhen you are on the property look for some of our favorite staff members Taman Wantilan Restaurant Kasi Subaga Arjana Putra and others Sundara Restaurant look for Lutik. the best smile on the property and so helpful and kind. And Adi is a fabulous waiter and recommends great dishes on the menu Sunset Cruise Putra did a great job and we enjoyed his youthful enthusiasm All the buggy drivers quick and easy to arrange anytime you do not want to walk Triana was the manager of our village and did a great job with his team servicing our villa morning and evening. Thank you Triana and team. Finally make sure to meet and say hi to Max. he helped us with buggy rides and with packing up some souvenirs for transport on the the airplane trip home. he is a special friend already and one of the nicest people we have ever met.

The welcome at the airport and at the hotels was outstanding. Our hotel room with its little plunge pool had just been refurbished and had everything we needed. It was a little nosy in the morning as we got a wake up call from the birds. The light shines in the bedroom as the sun rises the rooms have blinds. ensuring that our 4 year old was wide awake at 6 am daily. Breakfast service was great with quality food and variety there was also a wide range of local options. Our four year old loved watching the wildlife in the pond. The pools boys were very helpful and food and drink very good we mainly stayed by the infinity pool. There are nearby restaurants and hotels that you can either walk to or take a 10 minute cab ride. The food and the atmosphere in the Sundara is very good as is the happy hour from 5 \u2013 7 pm. The Taman Wantilan is a little outdated and the food is very western and the menu uninspired. The kids club is just by the infinity pool and very convenient if you are by the infinity pool our little boy really did enjoy his time there. The staff are very welcoming and accommodating and they are a credit to the Management team they all seem very proud to work at the hotel. The men who drive the buggies were very friendly and very keen to tell you all about their hotel. My only niggles would be the reduced lunch menu on Sundays for guest staying in the hotel this is so the hotel can accommodate brunch in the Sundara mainly geared towards customers who are not staying at the hotel. Secondly we were advised to use the pool with the waterfall this has very sharp rocks around and in the pool and it would be advisable to remove these if it is a recommended pool for kids.

Some years ago we had comfortable time at Four Seasons Resort Bali Sayan so this time we chose Jimbaran expecting the same experience like Sayan. We could only stayed there for 4 nights and had a much more wonderful time than we had expected. It is needless to say that this resort was almost perfect regarding interior of the villas well organized garden delicious food breathtaking scenery many kinds of activities for guests cozy and quiet atmosphere and brilliant staff. Beforehand I contacted the hotel to get some detailed information as usual and their intelligible quick response made me relieved. Our villa was a newly renovated Premier Ocean Villa. As like word of mouth sea views from the villa was breathtaking and elegant interior decoration made us feel cozy. Our villa was a one bed room with 2 single beds located the edge of the resort. Mostly we called a buggy for going out but it took only 5 minute walk to the lobby. We had daily breakfast at Taman Wantilan had lunch and dinner at Sundara. Both restaurant received guest warmly with smiles and delicious food. We were lucky we always took front row seats. Delicious fresh food beautiful sea view and comfortable breeze touched us. In particular Indonesian cuisine of the breakfast was excellent. The menu was served on a day \u2013 by day rotating and every menu was not heavy. Spicy food had an increased appetite. The private pool was always cleaned. We could swim watching wonderful sea view. In the night two light made the pool attractive so I enjoyed being in the pool from 6 in the morning until 8 in the evening. In the bathroom there were two dressing tables easy to use shower and bath tub. We everyday enjoyed taking bath with a pillow which I had never experienced before. We could relax anytime anywhere thanks to courteous friendly staff and quiet atmosphere. My mom could gain energy to recover from losing confidence in herself due to her illness. Every day she walked slowly in the pool to strengthen her leg muscle and received power from sunshine. We really think it was right to choose Four Seasons Resort Bali Jimbaran. We want to express our gratitude to all staff for their kindness.

I stayed here for 4 nights in June with my Mum. We stayed in Villa 269 a 2 bedroom Jimbaran Bay villa. I\u2019ve stayed at many hotels in Bali in my time coming to the island but Four Seasons Jimbaran Bay really did wow me. Where to start with what I loved hereFirstly the staff. Many have been here for decades the hotel is 25 years old but does n\u2019t look it at all due to last year \u2019s major renovation and they are just gorgeous. So sweet and sincere and genuinely interested in your happiness as a guest of their village. From the deck attendant down at Sundara to the pool boys to the room attendants everyone you meet is charming. It makes for such a relaxing stay. We adored our villa with its jaw dropping views right out over the bay and airport in the distance. Sitting in our pool watching planes silently come in and take off was dreamy. The bedrooms bedding and quiet was all just heavenly. We slept like babies. Staff are intuitive and clever. They realised things we like without a word and each day the clean was perfect and villa left just as we like it. Thank you team. I also saw the hotels Premier Ocean villas when I was here and they are stunning. Like new despite being 20 years old. I \u2019d definitely book that category if I came back alone or in a couple. Amazing polSundara is one of my favourite restaurants on the island and is a real highlight of the hotel. The deck there for daytime pool lazing is heaven and the food for lunch or dinner is faultless and delicious. Do n\u2019t miss the cod or the tempura or all of it for that matter. Wonderful and intuitive service there again. Breakfast was in the Four Seasons way perfect. So much choice and everything was delicious I tried. The set up on the terrace is lovely with the morning breeze and views out. I \u2019m a real pool person and you \u2019re spoilt for choice here. We loved them all. Sundara for on the beach vibes the kids pool never really any there to be fair for atmosphere and the waterfall and the quiet top pool for its calm and infinity views. Again staff are all universally lovely offering sunglasses cleans refreshing your beds fruit shakes and even complimentary snacks. They brought mum a plate of fries one day as a snack. Jimbaran Beach has tons of atmosphere and is perfect for a stroll. Sure there are better beaches on Bali but the truth is a lot of them take hours to get to and are devoid of atmosphere. Jimbaran is real Bali and it \u2019s a clean and very pleasant beach. Plus the fish restaurants are fabThe spa is out of this world. I \u2019ve been lucky enough to go to many including at many top hotels but this is the first one where the menu has amazed me. Such intelligent and wonderful treatments and the spa team are incredible. I had the Ku Nye massage and honestly I nearly cried out of happiness. My masseur was so good I came out feeling like a new man. All my tension and stress had disappeared and it \u2019s a magical spa to be able to do that. Add to that separate sauna steam watsu pools and it \u2019s probably the best spa I \u2019ve ever been to. Certainly the best massage I \u2019ve ever had. Bali has so many choices of excellent hotels but this one is really very special. It \u2019s glamorous but effortlessly so. Chic but not pretentious. Impeccable but not clinical. There \u2019s a big beating Bali heart here and lots of soul. With this dream of a location and the gardens and array of places to relax on offer you should definitely spend at least 3 or 4 nights here when you visit. In terms of distances Seminyak from here with traffic is around 1 2 hours. Nusa Dua up to 45 minutes. Uluwatu is around 30 minutes. Base yourself here and kick back and relax. It \u2019s a magical and beautiful place. Thank you so so much dear Uday Mathilde Mary and all of your lovely team for a real dream of a stay with you in your village.
