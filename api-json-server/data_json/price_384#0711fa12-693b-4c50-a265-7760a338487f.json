We traveled as a party of 4 2 adults and 2 teenagers for 8 days. From reservation to check out the service was perfect. Efficient and professional. The guest relations officer Alfie was outstanding he looked after all of us learnt our names and made suggestions for activities sightseeing for each member of the group. He checked in with us regularly. The rooms were very comfortable and spacious We were in ocean view rooms the view was spectacular at sunset wifi included as well as some basic workout gear hand weights skipping rope and yoga mat. Last time we stayed we were in a suite over looking the pool the mozies were annoying however ocean rooms did not seem to have that problem. The pools were great however we preferred the roof top pool as there were less small children through the day. Get in early to get a sunbed with an umbrella. Food and drinks at the pool were good and were served quickly. Breakfast is good large variety and reasonably priced. We ate in all of the restaurants and they were good there is a theme night every night we tried the BQ and it was great. We used the spa and the gym both good. The staff at the hotel are all very friendly and very helpful. Everything you need is close by yet the hotel still peaceful. Teenage boys had a great time they felt welcome and comfortable to move around on their own and stay for the day on their own when they were not interested in joining the activity of the day.

I spent two nights here after busy days for a Balinese ceremony Ngaben in Buleleng. Get a room through Acor online booking during the Bali Lombok package offer where I entitled for free return Airport transfer breakfast for two and 1x afternoon snacks. Intialy I booked into a grand deluxe room the price is competitive enough with others 45 stars hotel in the surrounding. Upon check in I offered an upgrade to Junior Suite for another USD28 night then I took it. Requesting a pool view room I had to wait for 15 mins but given a free drink vouchers in any of their bars on top of the welcome drink already served. The Junior Suite has a spacious separate living room with TV sets and a fully equipped separate shower room espresso coffee machine in the bedroom this is a perfect room if you go with children. The free snack included in the package turned out to be really good. Each of us served with two plates of three piece snacks one set of savoury and one set of sweets. After all it makes the Bali Lombok Explore package really worth it. We went swimming on their 3rd floor open swimming pool where you will have a good view of Legian beach a good place for a quiet tanning if you wish. They have another pool in the garden area including for one for children. Buffet breakfast has sufficient choices although the Indonesian menu is nothing special but acceptable. The bakery and pastry are good to go with your favourite coffee from their coffee machine. During the stay we managed to go for a spa package for couple. Reasonably price for spa treatment in 5 stars hotel in Bali the environment is really calming and good skilled therapist. I have no complain on their services. While they are almost at the end of the main Legian beach strip this is definitely should be a good choice for family or couple stay.

His name is Erik very pleasant man comes to your table most mornings and has a chat without being intrusive. he does his job well as he remembers converstions you had days ago treats everyone as a friend a real friendly social little butterfly. the grounds of the hotel are manicured to perfection not a leaf out of place. the lawns are hand mowed with clippers you really must see it to believe it 2 thumbs up to the grounds staff who do such a great job. I do not have one complaint about Pullmans. the price is a little more but what do you expect for perfection and also depends on when you book. we come here once a year and if you keep watch on the prices you can get great deals as prices are always changing. people Pullmans comes highly recommended from Mandy and myself. having a good safe secure place to stay makes all the difference to your holiday. come take a look for yourself.", "offset": [1560, 1675], "date": "2015-02-23 00:00:00", "cpt": "0", "category": "price"}, {"id": 5, "uid": "d8373e0d-a675-4804-a84e-19938c84c413", "sentence": "Very impressed.

We travelled from Doha for our annual long haul vacation to Bali and wanted to relax for 2 weeks and the Pullmans location fit best with us as it was fairly central between Seminyak and Kuta so we could explore. As soon as we arrived I knew I made the mistake of not ordering a hotel transfer. If staying here the private transfer is only 170k and I advise booking it unles you know what you are doing with taxis. Bluebird taxis are great and ALWAYS put the meter on and it is only about 70k to the Pullman. We ended up paying 20k but only because that was the best of a bad bunch when you leave the arrivals hall. The bank also messed up and blocked my card so we had to borrow the money from the hotel until I managed to call the bank. The girl at reception told us we could not have any cash at first but after 10 minutes of telling her we had no other option she managed to get a bundle of notes and borrowed us the money. It could have been a bit smoother and it must have happened to someone else before but I was grateful for the assistance. The hotel location was absolutely brilliant and it really made our holiday. We spent more time at the beach than any other holiday and it may be seen as a negative but I thank the small infinity pool for pushing us to go to the beach. If you do not like the beach this may be a problem as the infinity pool is full by 9 am or earlier that is the earliest I went down. They definitely need more loungers up there and they can be fitted in. I did not visit the pool on the ground floor so I can not comment on that but it is quite shaded at times. The room was better than I expected in terms of size and quality of fit out. There was a big bathroom that had a window into the bedroom. My only criticism is that the wardrobe is too small for 2 people spending 14 nights there. Maybe have some more storage in the bedroom or maybe the Mrs could have taken less. The cleanliness of the room was first class and the guys and girls cleaning them were always pleasant and adhered to request such as more mosquito spray and clean robes. Next up is the food. For a hotel of this standard I was impressed with the price of the food that we ordered at the infinity pool and the quality was good too. Perfect if you do not want to move a muscle all day. The novelty did wear off when you realise what you can order outside of the hotel for almost half the price though. Beware that 21 will be added to any price to cover taxes and service. A beer across the road on the beach will cost you half price and you can sit and watch the sunset which we did almost every night. If you walk through the gate for about 200 m at the end of the road North go to Ela and Duts beach bar. All of the bars are the same price but this one treat us brilliantly. The breakfast was a bit of a roulette and probably got the lowest score of my whole review. The selection looks great when you walk in but becomes limited after a few days. The omelette and egg station was brilliant and always good quality however other hot foods such as the bacon and sausages were not great. Bacon was fatty and sometimes glazed and the sausage choices were either beef or chicken of which both were not that tasty. There is a good selection of pastries but interns of healthy options I was not really impressed as the fruit was not very nice at all. Only the watermelon was nice with the pineapple being solid and the other fruit on offer was not to my taste. Yoghurt selection also limited and for 3 days in a row no strawberry and on one day only plain yoghurt available. I never really thought about the bottles being a problem but at times it was a nightmare in that area. Soaking wet because of the ice thawing and dropping off the bottles and no order at all. Get dispensers to solve this problem. Getting coffee was also problematic as often you got forgotten and had to ask multiple times some staff did not know what certain coffees were so this needs attention. There is live music on in the hotel quite a lot of the time but it is not advertised but we would have spent a lot more nights there had we known. Overall this hotel was fantastic and we loved our holiday there and the above constructive comments will hopefully make it even better. For the price there did not look like there was any better hotel and one day we hope to return to Bali and the Pullman.", "offset": [2312, 2427], "date": "2015-08-01 00:00:00", "cpt": "1", "category": "price"}, {"id": 12, "uid": "9509494a-71e1-4c91-a912-1eacd6ec7521", "sentence": "Disappointed this time around. Having stayed for 7 days in March 5th floor Ocean View Room. my wife and I were looking forward to our stay again although this time for 2 days having stayed earlier in the week at the Mecure Legian. We booked a suite Rm 1534 that has a rack rate of 30 380 a night however managed to pay 200 a night. Upon booking I asked if we could have early check in as we were in Bali already and we would be checking out early. 630am instead of 12 pm usual time. but that could not be acomadated. We arrived at the Pullman around 11 am knowing that check in was 2 pm but after three visits to reception did not get to room till after 330pm so first day was half gone They did provide a drink by the pool for us due to room delay. Room had nice views but already showing ageing but after 3 pm you could not sit on balcony as the sun was direct on the room. did not get to really appreciate the views. Not worth 30 Breakfast in March was excellent offering even sushi dumplings. They do not appear to be available anymore and remainder of breakfast was OK but no different to even the Mecure 5 night stay for 60 room overlooking pool inc breakfast other incentives. Spoke to two different people that allegedly had BAD experiences during their stay that I will not discuss but both seperate incidents were of some concern. Knowing we had to check out at 630am on the second day when asking about breakfast I was advised a breakfast pack would be delivered to room at 545am. did not arrive so upon checking out the packs were at reception. Not worth worrying about anyway as they contained two slices of bread not toasted jam two small pieces of fruit and bottle water. Very ordinary replacement to the buffet breakfast that we could not access as it did not commence until 630am. Overall I was really disapointed on a few fronts this time.
