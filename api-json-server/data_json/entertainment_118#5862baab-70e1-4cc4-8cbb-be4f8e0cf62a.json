Nice open lobby beautiful pools in each hotel wing but the stars were their restaurants. Terazo their beachfront open air Italian served up delectable Tapas and Italian fare. Of special mention the grilled snapper the pizzas and pasta and the grilled Australian steak. Good wine list to accompany the menu. Upper end pricing. And at the other end of the resort towards the road leading to Jungceylon Mall is possibly Patongs best Thai restaurant Charm Thai. Superb grilled fried squid prawn curries and chicken and pork dishes. Very affordable pricing. The resort also has the popular Sams Steaks Grills expensive.

Was there with my family wife and 2 young children 7 and 5 years old for 5 days 4 nights from Jun 14 to 18 2016Location The hotel has 3 exits that offers good connection to nearby amenities. Beach exit to Thawewong Rd Busakorn Wing exit to Rath U Thit Rd and the main exit to Ruamjai Rd Hooters restaurant and 7 11. Bangla Road and Jungceylon shopping centre is within 15min walk away The hotels beach exit is separated from Patong beach and the numerous jetski banana boat parasailing operators by a 2lane road. A Holiday Inn security guard will blow his whistle to stop the traffic. Such proximity to the beach is one of the closest in Patong compared to say Novotel Resort. It means that we were able to walk to the beach in our swimming attire and walk back to our room in 3min to take a shower. there is also a washing area on the left of the beach exit where we could spray off the sand When booking tour excursions from external vendors remember to highlight that the hotel is Holiday Inn Resort Phuket at Patong not Holiday Inn Express. Also make clear which exit you want them to pick you up from. RomsWe stayed in the Family Suite 2 adjoining rooms offers privacy qnd quiet for parents 1 x king bed for parents 2 x single beds in other room for kids. We got the Pirate theme Family Suite which came 1 x bathtub in parents room only found in Pirate Family Suite but not in the Turtle Family Suite The Pirate theme Family Suite is located just next to Kids Club and Kids Swimming Pool. A rear lift outside the suite brings us straight to the entrance of Sea Breeze restaurant the breakfast restaurant Sofa bed in parentsrom is long enough to fit a 167 m tall adult. The parents room sensibly come with tiled floors instead of carpet which facilitate housekeeping staff \u2019s daily job of sweeping the floor due to the sand brought in by our shoes. However the childrens room was carpeted. So we usually enter from the parents rom Balcony curtains were proper black out curtains which blocked the morning sun. Double glazed balcony doors kept the room very quiet even though we were right above the kids swimming pol The childrens room came with a box of toys and XBox with 2 controllers. Both rooms had their own 32inch Samsung LCD TVs and 29 channels incl BC CN Cartoon Network HBO Cinemax Fox Movies National Geographic HD Animal Planet but no Discovery Channel. There is a proper hardcopy TV guide Basic toiletries such as bath gel shampoo and conditioner and 2 cakes of soap are provided. We could request for shaver toothbrushes toothpaste if we had forgotten to bring ours 3 sets of towels small big in each room. Useful when the kids go swimming twice a day. Complimentary fruit slices Dragon Fruit delivered to the rooms in the afternon The mini bar fridge in the room was left empty so if you are the kind who likes to buy your own there is a FamilyMart and 7 11 outlet within 5min walk. there is plenty of space to store Free 4 x bottles of water everyday FREE room wifi connects easily and signal reception is god Power sockets are multi pin see attached photo. So no adaptors are required The multi pin power socketsare were built so close to each other that when one is used say to power a laptop you can not use the other to power a phone charger. Only 1 set of cutlery 1 knife and 1 fork was provided in the parents room none in childrens room. 2 sets of cutlery should have been provided. We also had the chance to stay in the Superior Rooms and Deluxe Pool View rooms for a few hours as our Family Suite was not ready when we checked in. To be honest these were sufficient for our needs. The 2 double beds in either were big enough to fit an adult and a child each or even 2 adults per bed in a squeeze. The sofa beds were also big enough to fit a child easily. Note that the Family Suite is different from the Kids Suite sometimes called a Family Bunk Suite. The Kids Suite comes with a bunk bed instead of 2 children beds. there is no door that separates the parentss room from the kids section. ChildcareLocated next to the Kids Swimming Pool the Kids Club accept kids if they are between 5 and 10 years old. The Kids Club programmes run from 10 am till 5 pm only daily except Mon We d and Fri where they end at 9 pm. Activities start at 10 am but you can park the children there from 9 am onwards. FRE Air conditioned Facilities at the Kids \u2019 Club are complete free of charge with LUNCH available from the club at an additional fee 20B for sphageti 310B for a beef burger. See attached photo for Kids Menu. Meals are consumed within the club The club has 2 separate zones catering to different ages DVD TV XBox arts and crafts games Lego table storybook play kitchen small ball pol Activity programme schedule was varied see attached photo. It alternates between Set 1 and Set 2 programmes between weeks so as not to repeat activities in case customers stay for more than a week. Just outside the Kids club are 2 dedicated pools Toddler Pool 05 m depth with water slide and Kids Pool 1 m depth with water slide whale and turtle fountains waterfall cave. An adult HAS to accompany the child at either pools. For access to the Kids \u2019 Club pool children must be signed out of the Kids \u2019 Club first Opens 3 evenings per week from 180 to 210. Perfect for parents planning a romantic dinner for two In comparison Club Med Phuket accepts a wider range of age for childcare Baby Club for those between 4mths and 23 mths and Petit Club for children aged 2 to 3. Both are optional paid extras. Mini Club is for age 4 10 while Pasworld club is for age 11 17. That said the hotel does provide standalone babysitting services. Some afternoon activities are optional and payable eg T shirt painting Shoes painting. Costs vary eg the shoes painting is 20Baht per kid. The teachers for these paid activities seem to be non Kids Club external vendors. Which also meant that during the week we were there when the external teacher was not able to turn up for some reason the painting activities were cancelled. Luckily the Kids Club remains open and continues to take care of the kids Although lunch can be ordered and there is childcare during lunch time DINNER is NOT provided for can not be ordered and there is NO childcare provided during dinner break 5 pm to 730pm even on nights where there is night childcare 730pm to 9 pm. The reason was that they have fewer teachers in the evenings compared to lunchtime. So they do not have enough to take turns taking care of kids while some teachers take their meals. The solution the teachers suggested is to hire a babysitter through the hotel concierge. We managed to make alternate private arrangement with the Kids Club teachers 300 Baht cash to teacher for 2 kids for someone to stay behind and handover the children to the night childcare teacher. Other Children related Facilities It was difficult for our young children to wash their hands in the common area toilets. Holiday Inn should install steps in front of at least one wash basin in each common toilet to allow children to climb up to wash their hands. There should also be at least 1 child urinal in each common toilet. This is already found in Club Med Phuket which is very child friendly Oddly there was n\u2019t any playground around. There should be a children \u2019s playground so that those who do n\u2019t like to swim can play on the land. There was this basketball futsal court next to the kids swimming pool which was strangely marked as a playground on the resort map but it was rather underutilised as a ball court and could have been a real playground instead. Food and DiningSea Breeze Cafe. This is where everyone had their breakfast buffet. True to its reputation it offered one of the widest variety and best quality of food Chinese dim sum fried noodle and rice Indian vegetarian English pastries bacon potatoes. It even has a cold room that houses cold cuts fruits rambutan long gan green oranges drinks soya milk milk juices cereals and Thai mango salad. Kids loved the yoghurt 4 varieties. I must say that they do not change their menu much during the 5 days we were there. Sea Breeze Cafe also offers a 69 to 9B seafood Tue buffet dinner but I think you can get better value for money outside the resort Other Resort restaurants Charm Thai Terazo Sams Steakhouse. \u2013 these were generally 2 to 3 times more expensive than restaurants just outside the hotel. At Charm Thai restaurant ala carte Tom Yum Gong soup was 240B while Phad Thai was 290B. A set meal at Charm Thai comprising Tom Kha Gai spicy soup whole curry snapper Vegscalops pineapple fried rice with chicken and coconut ice cream costs 69B Other set meals can go up to 109B We did not try the resort restaurants cos there were simply many value for money alternatives within walking distance outside the hotel eg Euro Thai Restaurant SG Sabai Sabai No 6 at Bangla Road Patong Seafood Chiang Rai Seafood. Bangla Road Jungceylons Food Bazaar fodcourt or a short tuk tuk ride away Kab Gluay restaurant Po Nurntong restaurant Lemongrass Pan Yah restaurant good for romantic dinner for 2 cheaper than Ban Rim Pa restaurant but same bay view. there is also a MacDonald and Burger King within 5min walk not to mention Hooters right outside the resort main entrance Room service \u2013 this offered a reasonable and somewhat cheaper alternative to the restaurants. Useful if it is raining outside. They took about half an hour to cook and deliver to the room and costs about 400 Baht for fish and chips 30B for a triple decker club sandwich see attached photo for menu. Shoping Retail products in the resort were suprisingly not that expensive eg 30B for a Corneto icecream in the resort minimart vs 25B in FamilyMart outside hotel. 15min walk to Jungceylon Patongs most modern air conditioned shopping mall similar to Bugis Junction shopping centre in Singapore. Prices for sports products are high though eg USD50 for a long sleeve swimming top. Has a basement food court. Activities If you exit from the beach exit and cross the road you will hit the beach maseuer aunties and their tentages. There are 2 water sports vendors on the left Choke Chai Watersports and Sea Gull and 2 on the right Water SportTheir prices are below.

I had gone with Choke Chai and bargained for a lower price given the off peak season but the operator dude said his company boss controls the price so he can not lower it for me. All in all Holiday Inn Resort Phuket Patong. is a convenient place to stay for families due to proximity to beach and shopping areas and good breakfast. You can save money by having other meals and spas massages outside the resort.", "offset": [9808, 9938], "date": "2016-06-20", "cpt": "0", "category": "entertainment"}, {"id": 9, "uid": "5c0f651b-e3b8-418e-bdcf-af2e19ee6082", "sentence": "nothing special. The only plus i can give this hotel is its location. There are 3 entrances one of them leads you directly to the beach and the other two to the street market. It is set in a very prime location and everything is close by. The famous shopping mall is also near by. The staff are very friendly and helpful they seem devoted and working hard to satisfy you. The negative part is that the breakfast is always the same same food and same setting. I have been here for 13 days and i m sick of waking up to the same variety of food. Nothing special for dinner nor lunch the food at this hotel is disappointing. There is a so called high end restaurant in the premises called Sams steak house comparing to the restaurants in Thailand it could be called a high end restaurant but this is an international hotel so i would describe it as over rated. Food is a very important factor in a hotel especially in the summer time where the risk of food poisoning is high. Sadly me and my family caught food poisoning from restaurants outside the hotel and spent 3 days recovering in our room. The building is quite old although it had been renovated there is still a lot of work that needs to be done to it. For example the water pumps needs to be replaced sometimes the water pressure is low and you ca nt control the temperature either hot or cold Sometimes you would smell a bad scent coming out of the bathroom due to poor sewage piping. Once we faced a problem with the electricity it got cut out for almost 2 hours a hotel like this has to have a generator or a substitute power supply to run the electricity in situations like this. Overall I would not rate this hotel as poor nor average its somewhere in between.", "offset": [239, 280], "date": "2016-07-12", "cpt": "0", "category": "entertainment"}, {"id": 10, "uid": "91a872ba-d372-4ffa-bf17-72ba035db8d2", "sentence": "Good Location very good resort.

This was probably the fourth time i stayed at the Holiday Inn resort Patong Phuket. and i am sure this will not be the last. a lovely hotel with a lovely ambience and a staff that goes out of their way to see that you are made to feel at home from the moment you step it in this hotel becomes a home away from home. i have a special preference for the Busakorn wing since the first time they suggested it to me the room i used is the studio one which is of a very decent size and has all the facilties one could ask for the one i used faced the pool. and although guests were out reasonably early in the morning for their swim and sunbathing it does not bring on any noise or disturbance if one wishes to sleep late breakfast is something to look forward to. there is something in it for everyone we are a vegetarian family we too had a lot of choices of things to eat the same can be said about the dinner as well. the cocktail menu too offers many choices. its great to sit beside the pool over a candle lit table. the street outside the hotel is a lovely place to walk in the evenings it offers a variety of things to do such as shopping food and various kinds of Thai massages. pubs too with a sounds of live country western music egyptian music and karaoke. should be on the things to do list. the gym is an added facility one can make good use of the hotel is almost adjacent to the beach which has a never ending list of activities water sport massage hair braiding manicures. even buying some beautiful clothes. the coconut water can not be missed cool and refreshing. i took my mother there to celebrate her 84th birthday she loves this place. the staff at the Holiday inn made every moment worth it they indeed belong to the Land of Smiles. every service there is done with the warmest of smiles. my all time favorite.", "offset": [1214, 1294], "date": "2016-11-19", "cpt": "2", "category": "entertainment"}, {"id": 12, "uid": "b702f2b2-ace2-49b0-b26a-7d6745804d58", "sentence": "Holiday Inn Phuket. A vibrant property with a buzzing surrounding. In the month of January 2017 we chose to go to Phuket a rainforested mountainous island in the Andaman Sea which is known for popular beaches old shophouses and busy markets. We chose Patong the main resort town to host us which is an area full of life thanks to the great hotels nightclubs bars and discos. Holiday Inn Resort Phuket located at the buzzing Patong beach area became our place. As I entered I loved the open lobby concept. Quirky colour elements were added to the couches as well as the celing. The resort well illuminated at the entrance welcomed us whole heartedly. With 29 years of experience in providing genuine Thai Service Holiday Inn Resort Phuket has built a strong reputation on an Oasis in the heart of bustling Patong. The best part Patong Beach was only a few seconds away. Not only the Beach but even shopping was also a walk away which include Jugceylon Shopping Mall and other leisure destinations. Coming to where you crash or where your wake up. The resort offers a variety of room types and styles to suit different needs and requirements. The Main Wing offers Deluxe Rooms Superior Rooms Family Suites Kids Suites and The Penthouse. We settled for the Superior category room which came with a king size bed a large sofa along with other amenities like In room safe radio alarm clock tea coffee maker fridge iron and iron board flat screen TV and DVD players. A new look. refreshing decoration in beach colors and modern Thai furniture created a Phuket resort feel. Signature bedding with choice of soft and firm pillows and light feather duvets was a delight. Balconies with comfortable seating gave our evenings a different feel. The modern ensuite bathroom came with a hand held shower. If a child under 12 years is accompanying you he she can stay for free using the existing bedding. What I loved is there is an extra care given to your kids. Though I do n\u2019t have a kid at the moment but these little gestures go a long way. So if you are a family travelling with kids I would suggest you the Kids suite where parents enjoy the facilities of a superior room while kids enjoy the bunk beds. Kids even have a separate TV with Xbox and Toy Box. Even the Family Suite is a Superior King room connected with a pirate themed kids dream room with 2 beds in boat allowing everyone to enjoy their own world yet still be together. Designed with imaginative features like boat style beds and treasure chest furniture in a PIRATE or SEAWORLD themed room it \u2019s an ideal family accommodation. This makes me go back to the time when me and my sister used to fight on silly thingsWhat will delight a parent even more is The Kids \u2019 Club at the Holiday Inn Resort Phuket which is considered a heaven on Earth for kids and paradise for parents. Newly renovated it sports a fun underwater theme and is open to kids of all ages with young ones safely entertained while parents enjoy some quiet time. There are four zones in the Kids \u2019 Club TV Xbox 360 Arts Crafts and Games \u2013 and qualified team of the property leads a schedule of supervised activities for children aged between five and ten. Facilities at the Kids \u2019 Club are completely free of charge with lunch available from the club at an additional fee. The other wing the Luxury Busakorn wing with Thai design offers spacious rooms with pool view or pool access in a tranquil pool and tropical garden environment. The exclusive villa rooms an Adults only area with pool access are appreciated by couples seeking a more intimate resort experience. Busakorn Thai for Lotus flower. Wing reflects a fresh degree of modern Thai comfort with a total of 140 Studio and Villa rooms centered around two magnificently themed pools. Having its own entrance reception and resort centre the Busakorn Wing is just like a hotel within a hotel and provides many additional choices to the facilities of the propertys Main Wing. The Busakorn Wing comprises two buildings of five and two storeys respectively and its overall design is an attractively modern interpretation of Thai architectural style. Given the comforts of the accommodation and the luxury of the amenities it is so easy to settle in and enjoy the many facilities the wing has to offer. But one of the Busakorn Wings main draws is that it offers the best of both worlds In the hotel you are blissfully away from it all in a tranquil environment yet you \u2019re also just a two minute walk from the buzz and bustle of Patong \u2013 with its dazzling kaleidoscope of restaurants bars shops and entertainment spots. If you are in Thailand how could you miss the Thai massage. Why go too far when you have Tea Tree Spa right within the Holiday Inn premises. With treatments to relax and reinvigorate it promises to melt away your cares. The spa also provides a wide range of beauty treatments to keep you looking your best. The spa menu has something for every type of traveller whether you \u2019re on business and pressed for time or you \u2019re looking for an indulgent spa package. Enjoy the therapeutic benefits of a traditional Thai massage refresh your outlook with an anti ageing facial or just zone out with a gentle aromatherapy massage. Leave your worries at the door and let their skilled therapists work their magic. Did you mention that you always forget to carry a few things. You do n\u2019t need to leave the resort to stock up on the essentials at the Holiday Inn Resort Phuket. The onsite mini mart has everything you need for your stay including soft drinks snacks and the full range of convenience items. I loved my time at the resort as well as city as I divulged in different activities. Holiday Inn Resort Phuket provides daily guest activities and dedicated kids facilities.

It \u2019s definitely worth to have it included as they offer huge selection of typical breakfast options but also lunch options for breakfast. I personally did n\u2019t like anything about Patong beach area and I was so thankful that we stayed in this sanctuary resort. There are many restaurants around the resort many food stands money exchange places travel agencies we used one in the resort as we totally trusted them shopping mall is about 10 minutes \u2019 walk I personally did n\u2019t find anything in the mall that would be worth to go back 2nd time and of course many bars and large selection of all kinds of entertainment places \u2013 but. most of these places are simply not for everyone. Patong beach is the single ugliest beach I \u2019ve ever seen. Sand on the beach was more like mud and the sea water was \u2026 muddy. I would say if you have a bad luck and find yourself in Patong Beach area then do yourself a huge favour and book Holiday Inn Resort for yourself as it is an absolute oasis. I am a picky traveler and I absolutely loved everything this resort offers.", "offset": [1194, 1562], "date": "2019-03-16", "cpt": "2", "category": "entertainment"}, {"id": 19, "uid": "1d152145-6d18-4195-b55d-df34dff6979e", "sentence": "Highly recommended for family with young children.
