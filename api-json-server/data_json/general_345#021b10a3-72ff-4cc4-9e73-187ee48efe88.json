I stayed at this hotel on a business trip for two weeks in June and I really have no complaints at all. Before I begin my review I should mention that like some reviewers have pointed out the lobby is currently under renovation but I certainly could not tell. This is a commercial entity so no one should except the hotel to close for cosmetic renovations. I stayed on the second floor and woke up one morning to find the front desk had been moved completely. There was not any noise factor whatsoever throughout my stay not unles you count the guests yelling with excitement during the NBA finals game 1 and 2. There was also one night when an Indian wedding was held there so there were a few noisy guests talking as they walked to their rooms. But that is not the hotels fault. They were not really loud anyway. The actual wedding venue was not noisy at all. I had a single king size bed in my room and plenty of space to put away the few things I needed to feel at home for two weeks. There is not a microwave in each room but I requested one and was given one for my room. The bathroom is a bit small but I did not mind it too much especially since I got a really functional restroom powerful water pressure from the shower and in the toilet. The cleaning service is quite superior as well. I typically do not have my room cleaned on a daily basis but after four days of hanging my privacy card on the door I found a basket with fresh towels and toiletries to replace what I had used. Other hotels I have stayed at do not even bother with it or throw it into a trash bag. The cleaning ladies were very efficient. Overall the service was exceptional considering there was tons of traffic in and out of the building besides the wedding there was also a college recruitment convention and a few other business meetings. Two staff members I enjoyed interacting with because they were very pleasant courteous and professional. Bridget front desk and Sep front desk are great members of staff to engage in conversations with. Sep also drove me a few times to nearby restaurants and stores to get food and gave me good options on what restaurants to visit. I left for work really early so I am not sure if this service is available daily but I do know on weekends there is a chef on site to make you an omelet and waffles to order. The breakfast buffet is pretty good as well. The hotel has one of the best gyms out there. There are at least 5 treadmills and 3 elliptical machines. Tons of weights multi purpose weight machine ear phones if you need and fitness balls. The pool is indoors within the courtyard and also got a lot of usage during my stay though I never tried it. The only thing I found odd was the sliding door which opened up to the corridor facing the courtyard. I like to open up my blinds in the day time to get some natural light but it was very awkward doing that knowing anyone walking by could look right in. But that was hardly an issue for me. If you are looking for a hotel to stay on a visit to the city this might be too far for you from the likes of Times Square or Central Park but if you are in the Long Island area or do not mind taking a train from Huntington Station the hotel shuttle can drop and pick you up from here to Penn Station in Manhattan then I recommend giving this hotel a try. Note that the Wifi is only free if you a member of the Rewards program which you can easily join at check in.

My three colleagues and I had to oversee a flight cancelation and were sent to the hotel to help manage the situation. The experience I had with every staff member I spoke to during my short stay was absolutely stellar. The hotel was notified less than 2 hours out that we were bringing over enough people to fill up 60 rooms. By the time we arrived Jade had organized all of the room keys and Erline had calmed down 100 or so agitated people who is travel plans were interrupted with a smile. Over the course of the next 12 hours I observed the excellent service that was provided to each and every one of the customers that interacted with the staff. Samantha P and Samantha L or Samantha squared as I remember them and Tim probably answers 60 or so questions from me alone and did it with big smiles on their faces. It was a pleasure to work beside them. Even the managers Harmony and Michael were visible and available ensuring effective management of the tasks at hand. It is a credit to the Mariot name to have such talented and accommodating staff members. In addition to the fantastic customer handling at the Mariot Melville the grounds of the hotel were lovely. The rooms were clean intimate and well maintained. The shared balconies that wrapped around the hotel are enclosed by a solarium that overlooks the pool. It seems to be a popular wedding accommodations in Long Island as I saw at least 4 different parties during my stay. Overall I had an incredibly great impression of this hotel.

Business trips are usually stressful \u2013 you \u2019re away from home you \u2019re working long hours and you \u2019ve endured the stress of traveling to get to your destination. This hotel and their staff in all departments help to take away some of that stress to make your stay as enjoyable as possible. To begin the front desk team makes sure you are greeted with a warm smile and earnest questions about your day. Each member behind that desk has started my stay with a kind welcome including Tim Harmony Jade Janese Angelica Samantha Deborah Chris Johnson Nico and Sep. For room service the sweetest girl taking orders is Maricris who recalls what I \u2019ve ordered in the past and asks if it will be the same. Ever \u201c hear \u201d someone smiling over the phone. I hear Maricris do it all the time. The food is always delivered quickly by either Alonzo or Lukas and I get it exactly the way I want it. If I ever need a cocktail Daniele at the bar is top notch with her service. She is always so sweet and friendly yet constantly professional. She gets a good feel for the type of drink I like and the type of drink I need. The rest of the team members in the lounge area Gary Scott Carlos R Silva and Nick also treat their customers as number 1. We know we \u2019l get the royal treatment whenever we go there.

What better way to start your dayAnd the glue that holds it all together for me and keeps everything strong is Walid the current Director of Operations at the Melville Mariot. Walid is who every person in the service industry should aspire to be. He holds everything and everyone to the highest standard but only because he holds himself to an even higher one. In talking to Walid you immediately feel that he truly cares about his hotel his guests and his team. This sincerity shines through in everything he does and you can feel the pride he takes in each of his actions. He always goes the extra mile and leads by example. One perfect illustration of how this hotel will go the extra mile happened during one of my stays in March. I had been fighting a bug and succumbed to it during the night. I was n\u2019t able to check out of the room when I had planned on leaving and upon hearing the reason why Walid and his team put together a care package for me consisting of Nyquil Mucinex Halls cough drops multiple bottles of Gatorade and pain relief. They printed a \u201c Get Well \u201d note for me signed it individually and dropped it off at my room.

The atrium has an open chlorinated indoor pool and there can be a smell of chlorine in the long hallways you walk down to get to all rooms even the outside rooms not just on the first floor but other floors. If you are sensitive to this it would be best to stay somewhere else. The outside room I was switched to was much more pleasant but windows do not open so again if you are chemically sensitive be aware. You have to call a couple of days in advance to avoid an inner or atrium room as they do get completely booked up. The staff are nice and try to be helpful accommodating but if they are booked up there is nothing they can do to change your room. Otherwise the hotel was more or less what you would expect of a Mariot and once my room was changed I was happy and comfortable there.", "offset": [190, 292], "date": "2017-10-19", "cpt": "2", "category": "general"}, {"id": 26, "uid": "0be0f096-cb2a-4c76-a759-9d0717ea42a5", "sentence": "Love this hotel.

I am a frequent business traveler like George Cloneys role in the movie Up In The Air only not so good looking and not as rich but I have seen a thing or two. My recent stay at Melville Mariot Long Island New York is worth writing about because first it was such a pleasurable experience meeting all my needs and second the staff was exceptionally wonderful. Adding to their intelligent efficient professionalism was a wealth of smiles warm greetings pleasant conversations and even some open hearted laughter. Never pushy always ready hospitable in the fullest sense of the word. My room was clean the window let in fresh air the television screen was better than the one at home the bed was just right the linens were fresh and soft the renovations in the common areas are handsome and comfortable. But for me the people made the difference I like what is happening there.", "offset": [850, 923], "date": "2018-01-26", "cpt": "2", "category": "general"}, {"id": 28, "uid": "cef8a851-38f4-49f0-a92a-b5ea57012c53", "sentence": "Nicely renovated. we have stayed here a few times and were surprised to see all of the renovations on the inside. Our room was modern and impeccably clean. The bar and restaurant area is much improved as the former bar was stuck out in the middle of the open area. The staff was super friendly and helpful. The location was perfect for us as it is a super easy drive to Bethpage golf course.

My sheets had bright red marks on the bed comforter. They looked like a big bottle of red nail polish was poured on the comforter. The beds are also smaller than I am used to. They came up and changed the sheets. They did not have a roll out bed that I asked for. I also asked the front desk if I could check out early and the receptionist said it would be fine. She also said it would be no charge. I have cancelled reservations before with no issues. After I was told it was fine the next morning I checked out and they said they would still charge me. I find that to be horrible customer service. I had made other reservations at another Mariot and was very upset. They refuse to acomodate their previous word.
