Great location for visiting the French Quarter also easy access to street cars and right on Canal Street. Great Jazz lounge Davenport so you do not even have to go out to listen to great music. Spa is quite nice but was a little busy I was there on a Saturday. I stayed in the club level which meant upgraded bath amenities separate tub shower 400 sq. ft for the deluxe room and best of all Nespreso coffee machine. I liked the decor classical styling. King bed was comfortable. My room faced away from Canal street so noise was not an issue. Their club lounge was one of the best I have ever experienced constant food presentations complimentary wine cocktails and concierge service. Cons. Only complaint and reason for losing one star is the entry to hotel. You enter in a fairly barren hallway. although it is granite and looks fancy it is still barren and have to take an elevator up to the third floor to get to the lobby. There are at least three different sets of elevators and depending on where your room is located you can easily get lost. It is quite a maze to find your way to your club level room. This actually may be fun for some folks. thoughFor me this hotel lives up to it is price point I greatly enjoyed my stay and well worth the cost.", "offset": [992, 1113], "date": "2015-03-07", "cpt": "0", "category": "facility"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "69dd7589-c943-4351-81be-4fb4ac539709", "sentence": "Nice Hotel a bit off the Quarter.

Stayed here for a work incentive trip. All rooms were booked on the club level which I would highly recommend. The hotel is historic so do not expect a modern ritzy hotel when you walk in. This property is located in a great area. My only complaints is the confusing elevator system. To access the club rooms it is like a maze and can get confusing for the guest. Rooms have very thin walls and the shower water pressure is poor. The club lounge is phenomenal. Club attendant TIM was wonderful and grew on me quickly. He was so thoughtful and professional. As a matter of fact everyone that worked in the club did a stellar job. The food and beverage offerings were incredible and I looked forward to making a visit to see what the culinary staff created each day. Club level is where it is at people.

Every member of the staff we encountered was well trained and very concerned about our comfort and enjoyment of the property.

Dropped into NO for a short sejours with the girlfriend. The low prices at this RC property frankly made me a little uneasy to begin with. I was right but would attribute that more to the state of NO than I would the hotel. The staff service and food at the hotel was at the least perfectly fine. The cleanliness and condition of the property is where I take issue. Granted it is an older hotel understood but I have stayed in even older hotels that were much better maintained. The cleanliness of the hallway and room carpets is downright unacceptable. I mean gross. I walked by a human vomit stain three days in a row in the hallway by my room without it being cleaned up between 769 and 71. Why did not I mention it to property staff. Ha mm because I wanted to see if they could pick up on it themselves. Needless to say they did not. I could go on on similar nitpicks. depressed room furniture random stains on floor in bathroom. but I think you get the point. Not sure but I think RC hotels operate using a franchise model otherwise I could see them closing this property for a variety of reasons. I think you can do better staying in a small BB type property in the garden district or elsewhere. Something a little further from the heart of the human wasteland that NO has become. People mention the perfect location funny to me.

We had a marvelous experience at this hotel. My husband and I are repeat travelers to NOLA and we wanted to stay somewhere we had not before. We were thrilled with our choiceWe spent 5 nights here and were fortunate that there was not much going on at the hotel so we had access to the courtyard the entire time save one 2hour block when it was occupied for a private event. I know some other reviewers ran into weddings and other things which tied up the courtyard a lot. That would definitely be a negative because the courtyard is one of the best things about the hotel. it is serene quiet and you are welcome to hang out and read or relax however you had like. but without the pressure of having to order food or drinks. But the great part is that somehow the wait staff magically appear when you do want to order something. Generally the hotel has many options for spaces to just hang out and relax. All the staff we encountered were professional friendly and helpful from check in to housekeeping to the concierge. Do yourself a favor and use the concierge staff. They are knowledgeable resourceful and diligent. Thanks to them we got last minute big shot tickets to Preservation Hall and we were so grateful to not have to wait in the long long lineOur room was on the 8th floor facing Canal which is what we wanted. We had a standard king. It was large clean and decorated in luxe fabrics and tones. And I wanted to take the mattress home with us SO comfortable. It was a week of great slepthere is a little cart in the lobby in the mornings with coffee muffins and pastry at reasonable prices. A great option if you like a light breakfast. So the gardenias this property has a gardenia fragrance in the air throughout the lobby area and the street level entrance. it is enchanting and alluring. The best part was picking up the fragrance wafting down Canal as we approached the entrance. It was soothing every single time we came back and it let us know we were about to enter an oasis of serenity in the craziness that is the French Quarter.", "offset": [1150, 1354], "date": "2016-06-25", "cpt": "1", "category": "facility"}, {"id": 14, "uid": "4c7f48e8-6c51-4dc8-b5d7-2220b2a8d300", "sentence": "Exceptional Service.

We were shown through the maze to our well appointed and very comfortable room by Andres who was charming and knowledgeable. The hand written birthday card was a delightful touch. We especially loved the decor beautiful large tub and view over the French Quarter. Our only very insignificant suggestion would be to offer more than one size of slipper in the room. The magnificent club level is worth every penny they are constantly serving a changing array of light food. We certainly took advantage of the great wine selection. Notably the ambiance of the club lounge is warm and sophisticated without being stuffy. What is most memorable is the staff thanks to Jena Christine and especially Kathy who really went out of her way to make our time special. We were kindly extended a late check out and enjoyed a morning in the serene courtyard with coffees from the lobby coffee cart. expertly prepared by Vincent he also was a great source of information on the area. We finished our day in the spa there is a charge to use the facilitates without getting a treatment but it was worth it. The steam room sauna and lounge are luxurious and Maria was helpful and present without being intrusive. The worst part of our stay was leaving.
