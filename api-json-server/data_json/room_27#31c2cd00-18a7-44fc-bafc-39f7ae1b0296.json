Am I really so odd as to want a bottle of cold water on hand when it is 10F outsideI was also disappointed by the woeful Internet speeds. I gave up trying to stream one of my favorite TV shows and used the hotspot on my phone burning through tons of data in the process. As best I can tell this hotel does not offer premium or standard Internet it is free but it is garbage. Slow and inexcusable.

Mariot has done an exceptional job at prioritizing the customer experience. That is the only reason this is a 4 stay. The property is dated for sure and hot water is an issue. My room was average and truly for 279 in Phoenix I expected a bit better. I only stayed here because I arrived into town early last minute and the Buttes property was not available until the next day. Again Mariot truly leaves a great impression with service.

Hotel Itself Needs a Refresh. As has been noted in other reviews the guest rooms definitely need a refresh. The decor and finishing are like a throwback to the 1980s. The meals I had in the Red Rim Bistro and from catering were actually better than you might expect in a hotel especially one near the airport. I want to particularly commend Brian who drives the shuttle to the airport. He picked me up on my way to the hotel and was incredibly welcoming and friendly. When I was leaving in a rush to get to my flight Brian took it upon himself to immediately drive me over to the airport.

The exterior of this hotel looks good. The landscaping gives you the impression of high end hotel. However the room decor is another story. It really looks dated and it is time to update the room in order to keep up the Mariot brand. We were at the 12 floor and got the mountain view.
