We were told not to purchase the full breakfast when making our reservation because Diamond Members get the full breakfast free.

My husband and I were hoping to relax in the hot tub Saturday night around 10pm but there were tons of kids in there splashing around everywhere so we had to leave. My husband was pretty upset about that. The only other option I would recommend is building a few adult only hot tubs somewhere else on the property.
