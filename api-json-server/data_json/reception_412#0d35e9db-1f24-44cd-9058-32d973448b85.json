Hell they deserve negative stars for what they put me through. I called 2 days prior to my stay to check to see if my reservation was set they could not find me in the system and the girl who answered my phone was rude. When I arrived to the hotel there was no clear direction of where to park for valet and when I went to check in the girls at the front desk did not greet me or my party they were rude and they were about to charge me twice for the room that I already paid for. I told them that the charges need to be dropped because I paid and they said yes definitely. So we got 2 rooms that were on the same floor but different halls I asked if they had rooms near each other and their answer was OH WE ARE COMPLETELY BOOKED. So we get into our rooms and the AC did not work in one so the guy called down and they switched our second room to the room across the hall from the first room. Completely booked. Yeah anyway. Hotel was not all that clean shower floor was gross the beds were disgusting and this hotel looks NOTHING like the pictures. So come time to check out I sent my boyfriend to check out his room first. They ended up charging my card an extra 300. After I told them I already paid. They told me it was too late to reverse the charges and I would have to call back tomorrow because the manager is not there. I asked if I could leave my number and they said the manager will not even call you back. What kind of place is this. A manager will not even call back for a mistake made by their employees. Anyway I asked for my cars to be brought around. 2 cars came in 10 minutes. No problem. My car took 45min1hr just to come around. The valet guy started to argue with us when we asked why it took so long. I was so pissed off at the terrible service that I just got in my car and left. When I got home I found that the stupid valet guys DENTED my car Tore my fender liner off and tried to repair it and left over 10 scratches on my front left panel. When I called back the guys were rude and denied that they did anything. So now I am left with a car to fix thanks to these morons. Oh and also I still have that 300 charge on my credit card. I call back every day and they say that they refunded it. Ha. My bank will be taking care of this one for me. DO NOT STAY HERE. IT IS TERRIBLE. Yes it may be cheap and by the beach but trust me pay an extra 50 and stay elsewhere. They do not care about their guests. they are horrible. They yelled at me over the phone and hung up multiple times when I tried to call. They do not take responsibility for their actions and pass the blame onto someone else. AVOID AVOID AVOID at ALL COSTS. Worst hotel experience ever.
