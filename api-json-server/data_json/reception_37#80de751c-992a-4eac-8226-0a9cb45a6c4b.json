The reason I gave the overall rating of 4 is because the signage to lead one to the rooms is in my opinion is unclear and incomplete. Staff was very helpful and did take us to our room when we could not locate it. We chose this hotel because of its location at the airport and both regional and long distance rail lines which made our journey back to the states unhurried and relaxing after visiting relatives in Southern Germany. All staff at the desk in the restaurants and bars speak fluent English and the menus are also printed with English below the German making ordering a breeze. Very clean and inviting facility.

Just terrible. I unfortunately got stuck staying at this hotel due to flight delays that caused me to miss my connecting international flights. It took around 1 hour to check in due to the large queue of people waiting. To give them credit this may have been due to masses of people in line with missed connections but when I asked the lady at the front desk she said it is always like that especially at that time of day. so perhaps they need more staff at that time of day. On checking in I ordered room service. It came fairly quickly and good quality food although he forgot half my order and had to come back later. The rooms are extremely old dated and smell dank. The bathroom resembled a one star motel with literally a makeshift board covering up the pipes for the sink. Appalling. this brand is going down hill. In the morning I woke up at the crack of down to drilling and construction noises after having only a few hours sleep. I tried to call guest services called 3 times with no answer. Finally someone picked up and offered to move my room. Given I was checking out in only a few hours the idea of gathering my stuff moving and trying to get back to sleep was ludicrous especially since I \u2019d been up for 40 minutes trying to call them to get moved. The lady on the phone was so lovely but the issue was out of her control. What a lousy crappy experience.
