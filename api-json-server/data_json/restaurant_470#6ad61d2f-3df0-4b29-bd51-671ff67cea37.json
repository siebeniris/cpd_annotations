Not a business property. To be entirely fair I am rating this up a full star due to the fact I made a mistake staying here. I am on a business trip and this is NOT a business hotel. it is a huge property right across the street from Disney and that is great. They have theme ish rooms and nice and helpful people. There is a McDonald in the parking lot. The first night I checked in very late and they did not have my Mariot status on file so I did not get a room on a higher and quieter floor. The air conditioner was so loud I woke up mid sleep with a migrane. I reported it in the morning and it was fixed for my next 2 nights. In the same morning the family next door was having a full out fight happy vacation. and I could hear every word for 3 hours through the paper thin walls. They checked out that day. It was not a very good start to the last stop on a 17 day road trip. What it does not have is anything I expect in a Fairfield including a business center free parking free breakfast so that is a real surprise at first. The parking is a reasonable 150 but the charge for everything on property does get old. No free breakfast no free coffee and I had to run to Staple to print some work documents. So if you are here for Disney and are looking for a great location to walk to the park this could be the hotel but for a business guy trying to work locally I had stay away. I have checked out early they were very nice about that and I am moving elsewhere in the Mariot family to a place that has the benefits I am used to as a Platinum member.", "offset": [1139, 1228], "date": "2015-03-07", "cpt": "0", "category": "restaurant"}, {"id": 4, "uid": "7e87da51-ce5a-436b-9a8d-b88f7c8308d4", "sentence": "Successful Spring Break. Our family of four just returned from 5 days at the Fairfield. Overall it was a great stay. We were able to upgrade to a higher level theme room with a great park view. We were able to watch the fireworks from the room. It was a very short walk to the main gate for both Magic Kingdom and California Adventure.

Put your car away. This hotel is a great place to stay for a family of four or smaller. it is right across the street from the park and you can walk to California Adventure Downtown Disney or The Magic kingdom. There are only a handful of hotels that are as convenient as this one. It has a small restaurant which is not complimentary and with a very limited menu but it is easy quick and relatively inexpensive. There is a McDonalds on the same street but we found it too crowded no matter what time we stopped in and the wait was longer then we were willing to endure. At least a 12 hour if not longer. There are no suites at this hotel only rooms with double beds or a King so if you are looking for privacy from your kids or have more then two this is not the place for you. Get one of the higher floors and you will have a beautiful view of the park. My only complaint was the Hotels recommendation of Starline Tours to Universal Studios.

I stayed here in May for 5 nights. I was very pleased to be upgraded to one of their themed rooms. I got the Toy story room and it was very nice and clean. The view from my bedroom was a gorgeous view of Disneyland. The rooms had a safe which is quite small considering that there were two of us and both traveled with Ipads phones kindles and passports. The A C in my room broke and it would not stop heating the room the maintenance team were very quick to fix that once we had called the reception. The breakfast at the pizza hut express was very good but the evening service for pizzas was a bit slow as there is only one oven and a few orders were going in at the same time. However they made that up by having the best coffee. They have Seattles Best coffee. My reason for staying here was its proximity to Disneyland as I partook in the Tinkerbel half marathon weekend. It was very nice coming back after a morning run to find the staff welcoming us back with free bottles of water and a banner congratulating the runners. After the 10 K run I did make use of their hot tub and it was very pleasant. it fits around 5 adults and the bubble timer is 15 minutes long. There are two targets nearby and an outlet center 5 minutes away. There was also an IHOP and a tony romas down the block which was excellent as we love both those places and go everytime we are in the USAI have no complaints about this hotel at all and would definitely stay there again.", "offset": [530, 707], "date": "2015-06-12", "cpt": "0", "category": "restaurant"}, {"id": 8, "uid": "5158dc8a-4c77-4892-b69a-8c62ee634422", "sentence": "Convenient for Angels and Disney.
