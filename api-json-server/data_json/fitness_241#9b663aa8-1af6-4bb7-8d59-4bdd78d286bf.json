As well as some other reviewers have shared this hotel brings up a mixture of sentiments. I went with a group of 6 people for 2014 end year celebrations and the final balance for all of us was positive. However although I would come back I would also recommend you to take into consideration upsides and downsides. Upsides 1. Service is overall good staff have good attitude willing to serve most of them smile and speak several languages Papiamento the local language english spanish dutch. I specially recognize the service of people from both restaurants at the lobby bufete Cielo Restaurant as well as from the beach bar Laurent and Nick were to my viewpoint the most outstanding waiters there. 2. Great Location. With private beautiful beaches far enough from the city center Otrabanda to get relax and enjoy the Caribbean but close enough to get a taxi and go there in 10 min. If i go back to Curacao I will certainly go to one of the hotels located in this area Hilton or Mariot which is just beside the Hilton even sharing a beach. 3. Beaches I would recommend you to go to the beach which is next to the Mariot and still within the Hilton. The sand view and size is much better and the walk from the lobby takes only 2 minutes along the beach with a beautiful see and some crabs walking on your side. 4. When one out weights the investment price and the overall benefit you get you get a positive outcome. It has everything to please your needs it is not luxurious or fashionable but good enough to have some pleasant time. Downsides 1. Lobby. It only has few chairs and most of time are occupied. It is old fashion very windy and certainly not at the level of a Hilton property The Mariot next door is contrariwise much more elegant. 2. Food options. Although you might find some good dishes within the BeachBar and the Cielo Restaurant menus the options are very limited to be there for more than 5 days. I had recommend you to order chicken wings at the Bar yummy. 3. Logistics We do not really know who was the brilliant mind behind the organization of the end years celebration but it really was one of the most awful and terrible events I have ever seen not attended because neither my family nor me were able to go. We arrived on the 26th of Dec and asked for a reservation on the 29th but it was too late because according to the staff behind the event and at the front desk it was already sold out to people from the hotel and outside the hotel from Curacao. I do not disagree to sell entrees to people not staying at the hotel but certainly the priority should be those paying more than 250 US per night. We complained about the situation but according to the staff the manager was not able to approve our participation. Key points I would recommend you if you are planning to stay there. 1. Room Do not accept a Room on the second floor too noisy and you will not be able to get to sleep. If specially refuse it if the room it is just above the lobby or the bar. We booked an ocean view room and we were assigned to the 212 if I am not wrong room that was just above the bar there were a group of teenagers getting drunk at the bar until 1 am and then yelling through the ail on their way to their rooms. Additionally on the second floor the view to the ocean is not outstanding. If you still are in the mood of view ti the ocean try to get a room on the 4th or 5th floor and specially from room 427 or above which are far away from the elevator and the bar. Our relatives stayed at rooms 548 and 450 without ocean view those rooms are apparently defined as with city view but the scenery is not really beautiful however are quiet and great rooms to have some quality sleep and then get up to get some action around the hotel or the island. 2. Transportation Most of taxis are vans or micro buses with a capacity of around 6 8 people. Either you go alone or with a group the fee is per person. It usually ranges from 4 6 USD per person so if you want to go from the Hilton to Otrabanda you will be usually charged 4 USD per person. Ask the front desk to reserve you a taxi and they will get one for you most of taxi drivers are charming but our favorite one was a lady called Shakira as the Colombian Singer her car plate is ended with 163. She will get you even around the island for a tour. 3. I would not book any dinner event. The years end event was terrible as we were informed by some other guests and the one that we attended latin party was just a Buffet with a very modest entertainment arrangement not memorable. 4. About the steam room at the spa. mm. I would not recommend to go it is old uncomfortable and not efficient technical speaking the steam is not well provided and is released below on of the chairs which is not nice for your leg if you put it in front. 5. Say hi to Rambo There is a cage on your way to the mini golf with a macaw large long tailed parrot with brightly colored plumage which is beautiful and very friendly. As you say hi he walks to the front to pay attention to you. Well I hope this information gives you a better picture to make an informed decision. For the first time in Couracao and in low season time if you get a good room rate do not hesitate to go. But if you are looking for a luxurious experience better to chose another one.", "offset": [4831, 4997], "date": "2015-01-10", "cpt": "0", "category": "fitness"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "9515923a-7816-47a2-82eb-2513175434a9", "sentence": "Great beach and snorkling. The best snorkeling off a hotel beach I know about in fact the coral seems to be recovering in contrast to most areas and there was a lot of fish for a shorefront. Stay towards the rocks and off shore where the bottom drops. Very close nearby is one of the best located scuba schools anywhere you can walk off the beach and easily enter deep water and a destination snorkeling area a few hundred yards away no boat needed. The closest beach is excellent but small with small areas under the trees to avoid intense sun. It is quite easy to swim from this protected beach despite well worn coral rocks. There is a desperate need to replace many of the beach chairs but I am sure the management will respond quickly on this one. The building is older and dated on the outside but the interior is immaculately kept. But there is a serious need for updating the furniture which is decades old. Management is very careful to keep the place clean and bug free but this results in some chemical odors these can be aired out since the doors open to patiosThe view from the ocean front rooms is spectacular as good as it gets for a desert island in the Caribbean. Walk among the waterfront for excellent views and larger beaches towards the Mariot with still more snorkeling but swimming from those beaches is much more difficult. The main pool is modern and quite interesting but it needs to be refinished under water. There is an executive lounge. While the view is spectacular this is not a strong point. I can not believe they charge for drinks I have never seen this in a Hilton and there was no real warning. The furniture is a bad joke most chairs inside are so low they put to chin high to the table and the outdoor chairs are the cheapest plastic. There can be a dreadfully cold draft from the AC ask and they will adjust it. The food during happy hour ranged from excellent to poor this was a native fish paste dish I learned to dislike intensely. Breakfast was better in the lounge. If you have the status or a breakfast included rate you can eat downstairs. This was a major disappointment compared to other Hiltons with a very limited selection but the cook to order food was very good as always. Hotel restaurant food was generally good except for breakfast although prices are high. You need reservations even if the hotel is not crowded. So many people seem unwilling to walk to restaurants nearby one of which is excellent or the superb pizza place. The bar outdoors makes some really good mixed drinks. Large tour groups walk through the lobby several times a day to get to the dock with the glass bottomed boat which is at the edge of the property. The exercise room was not up to Hilton standards. The spa was excellent and extremely expensive. Management seems intensely interested in providing the best service. But there seems to be a limited capital budget and they are cutting corners on the lounge and breakfast so much they risk hurting the overall performance. Budget car rental is there and we had good service. Other rental companies are next door at the Mariot. Now for my major complaint and warning. The rates quoted on Hiltoncom do not include large resort fees and taxes. My impression is that they even break the rate match guarantee compared to other sites that quote all in rates. This was my biggest bill dispute with Hilton before or during my years of Diamond status.

There are only 2 restaurants on site both with mediocre reviews. At lunch we ordered Nachos something that should be easy to fix right. Well apparently they fry their own chips in an oil temp way too low. They were soggy and greasy4. We were told both of our rooms would be Oceanfront.

Let me start off by stating my credentials. I am a world traveler who has visited the globe. I have stayed at the best hotels in the world including Four Seasons Waldorf Astoria Ritz Carlton and even The Kind David. I have never in my life encountered such trash as Hilton Curacao. I have personally contacted the Hilton and told them to take their name off this dump as they are sullying their reputation. The staff is one of the worst things about it. They are lazy incompetent and quite rude to English speaking guest particularly Americans. They can not seem to be able to grasp they are being paid for service. I checked in and received the wrong room. I got a double bed with rusted door hinges and the strong smell of mildew despite paying more for a king size suite. I spoke to an apathetic manager named Dafney that told me I would be upgraded to a suite on the first floor once the guests checked out. It was not until 7 pm the next day that I could move in because the room was not even cleaned by housekeeping yet. A short list of cons dirty brown stained carpet that looks like it came out of a crime scene rusted lamps and door hinges rendering them unusable cold mediocre food that is overpriced average burgers for almost 20. pool had not been cleaned in days not enough beach chairs no activities for guests no concierge.

The only saving grace was the private beach area that had nice snorkeling. It gets crowded and umbrellas go fast. The Mariot next door is under renovations so guests at Hilton could also use that private beach. The executive lounge on the top floor is a huge bonus. The staff there were just amazing. they helped us plan our days suggested local attractions and provided information on local activities not in the brochures.

We \u2019ve stayed at the Hilton Curacao for almost 2 weeks in room 523 which is an executive level. ocean front room. We were upgraded after booking a standard room on points as Hilton Diamond members. As we expected from other reviews the maintenance state of the facility is questionable however this is something the staff is very aware of and it outside of their area of influence. I will therefore not go into that any further except by stating that our room was quite adequate for our needs was clean and functional and apart from a stubborn drawer everything worked as needed. For us the vacation was very enjoyable and we recommend everyone to visit this hotel especially since the staff at the Hilton is great and that is what makes this a great property. So I will list the positive things we experienced as well as a list of areas where improvement could be made. To be complete I \u2019ve provided this review to the Hilton management a few days before we left and even though a response was promised we never received any. Areas of improvement\u2022 Communication We found the communication from the hotels to the guest to be very limited. Eg There are weekly activities BQ steak night Latin night etc. The only way to find out is to park yourself in front of the TV at the elevators and wait for all activities to come by. More practical would be to provide all guests with the weekly schedule when they check in. Other example our invitation to the Managers cocktail was delivered to our room around mid day of the day the cocktail was had. Luckily we knew from other guests otherwise we would not have been able to adapt our plans in time. Lastly they closed the Celeste beach bar restaurant 2 days into our vacation for a 3wek refurbishment something that came as a complete surprise as it was not on the website when we booked nor was it indicated at check in. \u2022. The towel system each guest gets a towel card for 2 towels. You need to use it to get towels and if you are not able to return the cards on checkout it states you will be charged 25. This does not seem to work well as the towel hut is not continuously manned so you can grab towels without leaving your card and get a card back when returning them or vise versa. \u2022. Cabana \u2019s See also the positive. We loved our cabana and were happy to pay 30 a day for that even though we only received our promised fruit platter twice. For us this was not a problem as we ate so much at breakfast we would n\u2019t be able to eat it anyway. However as it is part of the package it should at least be offered. It also comes with 2 bottles of water. Sometimes they were brought to us sometimes we needed to get them ourselves. Towel wise sometimes our towels would be already in the cabana sometimes we needed to get them. All in all the service was very inconsistent. Another thing with the cabana \u2019s there is no enforcement on the use. This means that people will also use them without paying especially when it is busy. Simple \u2018 reserved \u2019 signs and a little verification that non paying patrons are asked to leave would solve this. Honestly it \u2019s a bit frustrating that we paid while others didn\u2019t\u2022. Water bottles. One area that should really improve in a tropical location is the providing of water bottles especially to executive level guests. Currently water bottles are only available in the lounge when you ask the hostess when she is present. \u2022. Non hotel guests. The beach and facilities are open for use for non hotel guests through eg day passes or for people who use the gym. In the weekend a lot of locals seem to flock to the hotel to use its facilities. As eg beach chairs are very limited there are insufficient facilities to accommodate the hotel guests in the weekend. Positives\u2022. Staff. The staff is absolutely wonderful at the Hilton Curacao and is what makes this hotel a wonderful vacation destination. The staff makes sure issues are handled immediately. Eg we had a little housekeeping issue which was resolved within 30 minutes of indicating it. Also when our safe battery was low the engineer immediately came to the room to replace. The staff in the executive lounge gets a well deserved compliment. Karen Desire Iza and Yorah they are awesome. \u2022. Cabana \u2019s. We rented a cabana for our entire stay and never regretted it. The cabanas are comfortable relaxing shade providing and quiet. They are located at the top of the beach with a great view or at the pool. We had the same cabana for our entire stay. Especially on busy weekend days it \u2019s wonderful to know that great spot is there waiting for you. \u2022. Beach. Although small the beach is really great. The snorkeling is wonderful and the ocean is calm and accessible. \u2022. Shuttle. The hotel provides a shuttle to Wilemstad twice a day except on Sunday when everything is closed anyway which is a very practical way to get into town. Alternatively taxis would cost 20 one way. \u2022. Food During our stay we \u2019ve eaten at all the restaurants and where pleasantly surprised. The choice of food is adequate it is delivered quite quickly not American quick and most importantly it is tasty and hot. We found prices on par with other hotels so no complaints there\u2022. Drinks. The drinks are tasty and quite strong for a hotel bar we like.", "offset": [1177, 1239], "date": "2018-10-14", "cpt": "2", "category": "fitness"}, {"id": 16, "uid": "5d970b6c-5210-43cb-851b-381fc4fa1de0", "sentence": "To sleep or not to sleep. I had booked deluxe accommodation with shuttle from airport. Tired of waiting for the shuttle it had been 45 mn already I took a taxi 25 USD. Check in took 30 mn due to a discussion about the accommodation that I had booked but which they seemed not to have a record of. Everything was ultimately settled and I was given the oceanfront room that I had booked. View was great. Was surprised not to find complimentary bottles of water minibar or the like but that was not such a big deal. Sleep On Tuesday I had to go down past midnight because the music was blasting preventing me from sleeping. Had to do the same thing on Wednesday pas midnight again. On Thursday spoke to front desk in the afternoon clearly telling them that in my view deluxe accommodation includes the ability to sleep past 11 pm. They assured me the remainder of the stay would be quiet. Music was down a bit on Thursday. On Friday music was again blasting past midnight but I did not bother to go down since obviously the comfort of their guests did not seem a priority. On Saturday I could not take it anymore so I went down past 1 am and again past 2 am to tell them that this was unacceptable. On Sunday spoke to front desk again in the afternoon and music was at an acceptable level at night. Spa gym beach. I usually book massages on vacation. Did not do so there since it did not seem clean enough to me and did not have the spa like feeling. The spa is within the gym. Gym is opened to everyone islanders also. Hotel has a casino opened to everyone also next to the restaurant. They sell daily passes to cruise passengers and islanders. I am not too much of a beach person but I had planned to enjoy a few hours at the beach on Sunday. I did not stay and went into town since it felt to me like an ordinary very crowded public beach. Of course there was a lack of chaises. Cabanas are 30 USD day. Food Had lunch at Celeste \u2019s Caesar salad with shrimps 15 USD \u2013 good. Had salmon 35 USD at the restaurant once. Blend at best. Ordered a mousse which took forever to arrive. They did not charge it and it was not very good. The buffet in the morning was OK and had lots of choice. But I am not a fussy eater and would never complain about food unles it is catastrophic. They cater to events. So part of the grounds were booked twice during the week and Celestes not accessible. Once for an event wedding maybe. and once for a 5year old birthday party with all that comes with it. Needless to say that my definition of a holiday does not include a bunch of 5year olds screaming their lungs out until 7pm. All the above is a pity since the location is wonderful the small beach alcove is very nice there is a path that takes you along the ocean and the view from the room was gorgeous. It \u2019s at walking distance from Wilemstad about 1 hour along the coastline. I took a taxi a couple of times into town 20 USD and took the bus back three times 8A 1 USD. On time every time even late at night 9 10 pm. The big deal for me is when I book a room more so with deluxe accommodations I expect to be able to sleep in it past 11 pm. If I want music blasting past 2 am I go to a club disco. I travel extensively ranging from motel like rooms to presidential suites and based upon what I have experienced elsewhere I would rate this hotel a 2 stars at best. The fact that they sell daily passes cater to events have their facilities open to islanders music blasting right beneath deluxe accommodation and the like should be advertised clearly thus allowing people to make informed decision upon booking. They gave me a credit of 50 USD upon checking out. I would go back to Cura\u00e7ao in a flash since it has so much to offer people are inclusive considerate and friendly it has magnificent landscape but I will definitely stay elsewhere.", "offset": [1475, 1516], "date": "2019-03-31", "cpt": "2", "category": "fitness"}, {"id": 17, "uid": "86c65e9f-2e5c-445e-9ea7-940c59d9b70f", "sentence": "Nice Trip.

She deserved to much respect to get a flippant nickname. Dive shop pleasant and helpful. Front Desk gave us lots of info and help with activities we were looking for. Breakfast had a nice spread every morning with cooked to order available and in my early rising experience never very backed up. I am not much of a gambler so I never went to the Casino. You could get by without but a rental car might be advisable as this property is away from several centers of activity.", "offset": [1306, 1425], "date": "2019-05-10", "cpt": "2", "category": "fitness"}, {"id": 18, "uid": "e297c2d0-7c72-4806-98bb-401dad7df549", "sentence": "Very Nice With Lots of Potential.

Everything was sparkling and clean here with the resort being brand new. Really liked the layout with both pools having a gorgeous ocean view. Also loved the open air lobby bar. Beach was small but nice with easy access to the water. Pretty garden area we did n\u2019t even realize was there until our last day. Included pics of the fitness center four treadmills three elipticals and a bike. Very well set up for the brief bouts of rain with large umbrellas. could sit in the covered lobby bar or at the beach bar until the weather passed. Food was mediocre the pool bar food was our favorite gastro pub was good but small portions did n\u2019t care much for the main restaurant though we did have the breakfast buffet every day only 1695 so prices must have changed from previous reviews. Drinks were fantastic. They do n\u2019t have a Blue Lagoon listed on the cocktail menu despite containing the islands namesake liqueur but all the bartenders were able to make me one and they were great. One bonus our room was on the third floor overlooking the pool but we never heard a peep of music or loud kids from downstairs. 30 cab from the airport 25 30 most places in town.", "offset": [341, 421], "date": "2019-12-24", "cpt": "2", "category": "fitness"}]}
