This hotel is amazingly moderately priced. The parking is not cheap but honestly roughly 50 day is the going rate in Fishermens Wharf. If that is too expensive for you drop your stuff off at the hotel and go park near the Embarcadero for 20 or so per day and take a cab back. you will still save some money. Others have remarked on all the amenities nearby. The staff is all wonderful and seem happy to be working there. Lots of transportation good restaurants and tourist stuff all within easy walking distance. It is a boutique hotel. The evening wine reception is a nice touch and very popular. The rooms are smallish compared to most US chain hotels. The carpet in the hallways could use replacing. And what is with the toilet paper dispenser. You do need to be a Chinese acrobat to be able to twist that much while sitting on the throne to reach it. Why did not they just mount it on the other side. It would be easier to reach. But if that is all I am griping about that is not much. Would I stay here again. Most definitely yes. This is one of the best deals you will find in all of San Francisco.

On these things I rate the hotel as very good. When we checked in we had an older guy dealing with us he was really nice we took to him instantly. When we got to our downstairs room the first room next to reception. we reported that the toilet was blocked not by us I have to mention. It overflowed onto the bathroom floor. My hubby reported it but no one came. By then the nice old guy had gone and was replaced by one very miserable female and a guy. I then went back out to report it and instead of being profusely sorry they treated me as if I was wrong to complain that our toilet was blocked and the bathroom floor was swamped in sewage. I asked to move rooms but was told that the hotel was overboked and that they were in the process of moving people to a hotel round the corner. Then a lovely guy came to fix the toilet. He told us it was fixed and mopped up the sewage on the bathroom floor with towels. No one came to disinfect or mop. We went out that evening. next morning it was blocked again. Worse this time. It was coming up through the bath as well. I went to complain again. This time it could not be fixed. We were told we could then move room when one had been cleaned and to pack up go out for the day and when we got back one would be available. So we went out. Used the public toilets had no shower facilities. We came back early. Eventually after having to chase continually we were given another room. Surely in the morning they could have asked the cleaner to clean a certain room first so we could move in. Even though we were dissatisfied customers were were given a room with the view of a red pink brick wall directly outside the window and above the generator. We could not believe it. The room was worse with the exception that the toilet worked. Suffice to say we did not sleep much that night due to the noise. We got up at 60 am and left. In all it is a nice hotel in a great position but the staff were miserable and not once did one person apologise for the inconvenience of having prepaid for a room where we could not use the facilities for part of the stay.

The closet door acted as if it wanted to come of the hinges. It was so noisy from the street noise it sounded like the broke down windows were already open looked and nope they were close with dust piled in it. The sofa in the room looks like something from threes company and for those of you that do not know what that is that was a 70s show from way back in the day. So I asked for a sheet to put on it sofa because it was dusty and yes they brought up a sheet with yuck hair on it that sure was not mine. The light fixtures are from the same 70s show.

Oh and let us not forget the bus stop that stop directly across the street that is infested with thugs and homeless people.

The Bartenders are super nice and friendly we had drinks and appetizers every night in the Lounge. They played awesome jazz music which I enjoyed every evening. The restaurant Pescatore was lovely with great service from Jose Rene. The food was very good from breakfast to lunch and dinner. The room was nice and clean with great pillows and bed.

Daily room service person would knock once then enter the room within 2 seconds despite the DND sign out.
