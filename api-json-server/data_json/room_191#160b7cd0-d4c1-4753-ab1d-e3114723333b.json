Over all a beautiful beach and beautiful hotel with service you would expect form the Ritz Carlton. Rooms were very beautifully updated and the beds are fantastic.

And if you get a chance take yoga with Andrea or an Ayurvedic consult with Elise. My son enjoyed the fitness center too.

Went to this resort as a result of an incentive work trip. My wife and I usually stay at all inclusive resorts given the choice so we were not sure about how expensive this place would be. it is expensive. Now I am sure that is just fine with most people planning a stay at a Ritz Carlton. But what this place cost did not deliver what we expected. First impression We were too young to be there. I am in my early 30s and it seemed the average age there was 60. Nothing wrong with that just not usually the type of place I had choose to vacation. Example We spent most of our time with another couple who traveled with us. we are not loud obnoxious late night partiers but someone called security on us twice in one night while we were hanging out on our 1st floor patio. at 10 pm. Even the person sent to quiet us down said we were not being loud but he had to do his job and ask us to go inside due to a complaint. Awesome way to spend a vacation quiet and indoors at 10pm. Rooms. Nice enough rooms expected more luxury for the Ritz. Our room was on the 1st floor with a patio facing the water. Although The patio next to us was separated by a 3 12 foot wall. Not much privacy there but it was ok since we knew the people next to us. Overall the rooms were nothing special. Room service for drinks was fairly quick though. Pool Beach did not spend much time at the pool opting for the small beach area instead. The view from the beach was absolutely incredible. The best part about the resort by far. Service on the beach was excellent as well. Food Since we were there for a work incentive trip most of our meals were at work events. can not comment much on the restaurants except for the place we ate breakfast every morning. I had say good not great but that had be generous considering it costs around 60 couple. I really hate to complain. really. Read my other reviews. Maybe it is because I expected more. Maybe they really do rely on their name to express luxury without actually delivering on it. Overall I have to go back to the expense. We were there for just 4 nights. Our rooms were paid for most of our meals were paid for through work events and half the time our drinks were too. However between two couples we managed to still rack up a 160 bill. Most of that was the 15 frozen drinks and 7 beers. we have stayed at more than one all inclusive that was nicer more luxurious with better amenities included better food and better service for the same price it costs just to pay for the room at The Ritz Carlton.

My wife and I stayed for a week in Mid October. I have seen varied reviews so hopefully some perspective will help especially for first time visitors. St Thomas The airport is 45 minutes away. You need to either take a cab rent a private car with driver or rent a car to drive yourself. A cab is usually a 10 12 person van which will take multiple groups till it fills up. That means stopping along the way at various hotels. The cost is lowest. A private van or car would be 90 120 each way. Car rental varies but can be difficult navigating as they drive on the left and have limited street signs. We paid for a private car with driver. We met a couple that rented a car and they said it took over two hours to get to the resort. The Ritz Carlton does not provide transportation. Resort. The Ritz Carlton Resort is made up of multiple buildings spread out along the hill overlooking Great Bay and you may find yourself walking a good distance. The terrain is hilly but they do provide resort shuttles for those that prefer not to walk. Shuttles are golf carts driven by staff. The sister resort next door is the Ritz Carlton Destination Club and you can use the Services Amenities. If you are interested in visiting St John and any of the BVI this is a great location on St Thomas. Room. We booked Resort View with Club Level. The room had a great view of both the garden interior and Great Bay. Based on the hotel set up everyone has a view to the Great Bay but some are a bit better. I posted pictures from the room so you can see. Everything looks exactly like pictures on the Ritz Carlton website. The room bathroom were great. The Club Level provides food and drink from 7 am to 10 pm. We had a buffet breakfast with an omelet or fresh eggs each day. Lunch some days and snacks and adult drinks all day into the night. The offering at dinner is hors doeuvres so not what most would want for a meal. Later evening is small deserts. Dining. the Ritz We ate lunch at Sails twice and Coconut Cove at the Ritz Carlton Destination Club twice. Both were good with no complaints. Serving size was large in our opinion. We were not able to finish our lunch. Viola Sails and Al at Coconut Cove provided excellent service. I do n\u2019t recall the names of our other servers but the people working there were great. We also ate at Bluewater and Grand Palazo Club and both dinners were very good. Note you need to pay via credit card at Grand Palazo Club as it seems to be leasing space at the Ritz Carlton Destination Club. Amenities. Beach is soft sand and little to no waves as it is on Great Bay. The snorkeling is very good and you can use the non motorized equipment as they included in the resort fee. Paddle boats Stand up paddle boards Kayaks Hobie cats Windsurfers and Snorkel equipment. The pool was being resurfaced while we were there. So we did miss having the pool but we could use the Ritz Carlton Destination Club pools if we wanted. We liked the beach but a couple days the noise from the resurfacing got a bit loud. We did n\u2019t use the fitness center. Day Trips. We took the Red Hook Ferry to Cruz Bay in St John. Note it runs on the top of the hour. We arrived at 1005 am and had to wait an hour for the next ferry. We rented a car and drove all over St John. Ate at Skinny Legs in Coral Bay and visited Cinnamon Bay Trunk Bay and had dinner at The Beach Bar in Cruz Bay that night. I would definitely recommend going to St John. We also booked the Lady Lynsey day trip to Jost Van Dyke and White Bay. They pick you up at the Ritz Beach. It is a full day trip with a snorkeling stop followed by an afternoon soaking in the Soggy Dollar Bar in White Bay. Snorkel gear is included. Lady Lynsey is the Ritz Carlton Catamaran but is operated by Cruz Bay Watersports. Thoughts. We really enjoyed our trip and the resort but you have to understand when going to places off season they may be doing repairs or some things may be closed. For example we wanted to eat lunch on St John at the Canel Bay Resort Beach Bar as part of a day trip. When we arrived at the gate we were told the resort was closed for two months as it is off season.", "offset": [1361, 1429], "date": "2016-10-26", "cpt": "0", "category": "room"}, {"id": 7, "uid": "a75037a9-45ec-400c-a9ff-7e9601d27e86", "sentence": "Relax and Enjoy.

We had a slight glitch with our dining plans and that is why I am writing this review and to recognize Camila the guest relations manager.

While we did not ask for anything Camila offered us dinner at their Italian Restaurant Esenza. Camila and the manager were there to greet us and we met the amazing Chef of the Restaurant and the Head Chef for the property. Both were warm and friendly and we dinned on the patio beneath a full moon and clear skies. You could not ask for more. The food including the Veal Oso Buco was amazing and incredible. Camila was there to assist us in anyway. To just give you a small example my wife after her enjoyable massage left her hat in her spa locker. We had to leave early the next morning 530 am to be exact to make our flight home and there was Camila with the hat in hand and a bag with fresh fruits and pastries to enjoy on the way home.

We were kind of brought around to different areas of the lobby until we were sat down and someone came over to help us. It seemed like staff was unsure what to do with us. We did not like that our bags were sitting in a pile of other peoples luggages outside the hotel until our room was ready. Mind you we absolutely love the Ritz located on cayman island and all their other properties. Our hotel tour guide was great in showing us around and answering general questions. The view from the resort is stunning in itself. It was pouring our first day so we were looking to browse the shops at the hotel do anything however only their jewelry store is open all the other shops are not yet ready. To my knowledge there is no arcade or really much else to do besides lounge at the pool beach activities and excursions. Calling concierge the staff was not very knowledgeable on what stores are open which surprised us. Also we were being called by the wrong last name our entire trip do not know what was up with that. We had club access where we spent a lot of our time having drinks and munching on snacks which was nice. Our first night we ate at Bleu water restaurant the atmosphere was bland decor was lacking it came across like more of a family restaurant less of a romantic feel we were trying to go for being a steakhouse. Our food took over an hour to come out. However our food was tasty. Our next day we reserved a cabana by the pool which was nice. When we got to the pool area I let staff know we have a cabana reserved and we were told oh no they are all reserved I let them know I reserved mine a week before our trip then I was led to my cabana which was not set up yet. It was 11 am they rent out from 9 am for the day. Service was just ok. The beach is not the most enjoyable due to all the coral sea grass. This is definitely not a pure white sand beach Incase that is what you are looking for. Only one pool is open right now so everyone is congested into one area. There is a slide being built which looks fun for the kids. I highly recommend taking the ferry over to trunk bay beach in St John it was the highlight of our trip. That beach is beautiful pure and memorable. Pros. Staff was very very kind. They can drive you anywhere via golf cart should you choose not to walk.

Room service food quality was not good plates came dirty and food did not look pleasant to eat. A Ceasar salad at the ritz should not be salad from a bag with bagged shredded cheese soggy pieces of bread serving as croutons and bottled dressing.

I know about the hurricanes yet after calling was assured I would not be disappointed. To start checking in was very confusing took some time. They explained nothing to me just stating how to get to my room. I was not given a map which is needed for the property nor was there one in the room. The phone systems buttons were not working after a long flight being very tired getting a busy signal from room service for 3 hours I called the front desk to be told the phone buttons do n\u2019t work to just dial 0 for everything. Nothing in the room stated that or anything about the hotel. Room service took an hour was one of the worst meals I ever had. I tried it 2 more times with things you ca n\u2019t mess up yet everything was bad extremely over priced. I tried the free breakfast in the restaurant once yet people had to wait 20 30 minutes to pay or to sign for the free breakfast they were getting mad at people who were getting up leaving. I would call ask for items without anyone showing up. The walkway to get anywhere in the hotel from where I was at was covered in mud at a work site never cleaned up even after I said I almost fell saw 2 others fall at the same place. There is no check in desk I never received a receipt in person or email of my stay as did the people in my cab I as they could n\u2019t find anyone to checkout. The TV basically never worked the whole stay even though I reported it as well. The worst thing was I called to have my bags picked up by 9 am to make my flight. They never showed I called. 945. they said they would be right there. 1020am I took my bags walked up the long hill to the front of the hotel sweating profusely almost passing out. I am disabled Rooms are about 100 per day yet with the service of a cheap hotel. The 890 NewYorker hotel I stayed at before. after my trip there had 100 better food service.

Ritz Carlton I pay expect get better food service at your hotels resorts I have till this trip \u201c always \u201d gotten it you need to fix it.
