I have spent lots of time in SF but this was my first stay at the Mariot Marquis. Like many others I was there for a business conference and I have to say that it is set up pretty well to serve the conference circuitI am a rewards member with not many points so not sure if that affected my experience or not but here is what I found. Check in was easy and I was able to get the room by 1230Excelent service from the bell staff front desk and concierge. Friendly and helpful. The room was quite large by SF standards with a wet bar with fridge and coffee maker and large sitting area with couches and tables. The windows opened to let the breeze in it was sunny and warm this trip. Housekeeping was on point friendly and efficient. The only down side of the room was theTV. High def TV playing analog signal and the image was substandard. No street noiseWiFi was free maybe due to my membership and had enough bandwidth to support Netflix streaming. On the first day I recevied an email from management welcoming me and requesting that I relay any requests or concerns. This was useful as I wound up having one issue which was addressed quickly and professionally very good customer serviceWe enjoyed the indoor pool and hot tub as well as the upsairs lounge with great views of the bridge and bay. Reasonable drink prices here. As mentioned it is ridiculously expensive to park here but that is everywhere in the city. Location is great and you do not need a car in SFI would return without a doubt.

Actually the whole lobby was well staffed for people like me with lots of questions especially re directions. The in house eating options were a little bit hit or miss though.

I am long term Mariot Client 80 nights worldwide. Great location to get to everything yet a quite enough area that you do not feel overwhelmed. Yes the hotel is under construction but I did not find any real issues. We were out during the day. The new lobby is very nice. Dan at the Concierge Desk is one of the best I have experienced. He can validate any plans and provide guidance. They also have a good website with info. The lounge was top notch and one of the best in terms of seating quality of food and service. The View Lounge is awesome but is small and expensive. You need to go up and at least have a drink and relax. Someone mentioned not enough pillows we just called down and they brought pillows in a few minutes. The internet was decent no issues. We loved that they kept the windows that open. Love getting fresh air in a room. The gym is the best one I have seen in a Mariot outside of the Renaissance Spots. It is two floors and great selection of weights machines and cardio machines.
