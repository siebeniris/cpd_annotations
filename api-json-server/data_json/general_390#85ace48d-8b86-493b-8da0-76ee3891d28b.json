I have been in there before to walk through the casino but never actually stayed. Our arrival went super smooth. Our room was ready early there was no long lines at the check in and the staff was super friendly. Only downfall there was we asked for an ocean view was told our room was ocean view. When we walked in the room it was not an ocean view. Hopefully next time we get the view we wanted. Our room was very clean and the decor is very modern. The beds are comfortable and the whole overall feel of the room was great. The only other complaint I have about the room was the hot water. We did not have hot water in the shower. I am not sure the reason why and we were only there one night so I did not escalate the complaint. The casino and hotel itself was really clean. It was vibrant light and airy and had a great vibe to it. We enjoyed walking around looking at all the memorabilia and it was easy to get around. I will stay at this hotel again.

However the two times I took a shower the water was cold which delayed my process to check out efficiently and comfortably waiting for the shower to warm up. Unfortunately the water never warmed up. I was quite annoyed. Secondly one of the staff guest agents informed me that I would be able to get the parking fee waived. I was told to retrieve the casino wild card and then head over to the parking department. Another agent stated that this keeps occurring and that unfortunately I would not be able to get reimbursed for the miscomunication.
