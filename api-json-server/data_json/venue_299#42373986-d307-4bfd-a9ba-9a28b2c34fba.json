When I went to the conference lunch and was lamenting the vegetarian options Jose or Joe. honestly I forget his name. overhead me and came over to ask me what I wanted. He prepared a few special meals for me and sought me out at every meal both to make sure I was happy and also to find out what I wanted. After the conference we had a small Super Bowl viewing party because the conference ended on Super Bowl Sunday. At the party I was again lamenting the lack of vegetarian options. Sure enough Stanley overhead me and then asked if I had like a special plate. He made me some great hummus and vegetables.

Yikes. I just returned from a business trip in New Orleans and had the pleasure of staying at the Ritz Carlton. My father and I had a delayed flight for several hours and arrived at the hotel around 9 pm. We were quickly checked in and dropped off our luggage in the room so we can grab some dinner in the lounge. The nice touches does make a stay more enjoyable. The room had already been turned down and prepared for the evening. That was a surprising touch after spending half of your day in the airport. The next morning we had breakfast in the restaurant which was part 1 of the 2 disappointing parts of the trip. We both ordered oatmeal with fruit because we had to get ready for a luncheon. The oatmeal was taking well over 15 minutes which at first I did not mind because I thought it was being made fresh. but when we received our luke warm oatmeal after the server overheard me say I m surprised oatmeal is taking so long was disappointing. What was even more disappointing was we sat down before a couple was seated they ate from the buffet twice and got up to leave around the time our oatmeal arrived. We made our way down to the luncheon on the second floor and had a pretty pathetic lunch. part 2. The salad had maybe 4 pieces of lettuce and my food steak and fish was cold. I thought maybe it was just my plate but other people complained later that their food was cold. Pretty disappointing for Ritz standards. While listening to our presenter during the luncheon I started hearing water pouring. At first I thought it was a server who dropped water but when I saw Ritz staff running to a door I looked around and saw that the ceiling leaking. Water was pouring through the light fixure from above. The water was pouring to a fast drip 15 mins later. Pretty surprising for a Ritz again. I can only imagine that happening during a wedding and a brides day being ruinedThe rest of the trip was enjoyable. The concierge booked us a great tour of the city and the doorman was very nice.

No deduction from the bill. I have stayed at lesser chains that immediately deduct from the bill with sincere apologies since washing is clearly half of what you are paying for in a hotel room. The staff was not very sympathetic. Few kind greetings in the hallway as well. For 50 per day in valet service I would expect the phone to be answered when we needed our car. It was not. Each time we had to go down request the car and wait. If I can walk to my own car 3 times over in the time it takes to get my car then what exactly is the service for. Further if you have a guest that is departing and returning later that evening I would think the valet might mention to the guest that there is a major event going on that evening and returning to the hotel may prove difficult. We did not know all roads would be barricaded off by police and we should ask the police to let us through. When I mentioned this at checkout again the staff could have cared less.

First Service. Excellent. Staff is always ready willing and able to assist and with a great attitude. Second Room. This was a set price room for the conference rate. Very inexpensive cost due to this but still a very decent size room looking down at the courtyard. The RC in New Orleans is built in a square with the middle an outdoor seating area courtyard. Quite nice visually. I am not sure what the normal pricing of the room would be but for our convention price it was a great deal. The bed was excellent a great night sleep. Third Hotel Features. This is where there was some items that need attention. The hotel temperature in the common areas was apparently attempting to capture the inner chambers of an Alaskan igloo. It was absolutely freezing. No amount of complaining seemed to alter this. At the conference everybody was moaning about the frost. I understand New Orleans during the summer is hot and humid but this was not summer and outside was a temperate 65 to 70 degrees. I am not sure why the thermostat needed to be at 50 degrees inside or felt like it. Another inconvenience was the elevator situation. Maybe it can not be helped but when you enter the building the elevator takes you only as high as the third floor lobby level and from there you catch another elevator on the other side of the lobby to your room floor. After a few days of this it was quite a pain in the you know what. I assume that this design ensures the riff raf must parade before the lobby desk to avoid any entry into the floors above but since you need your key to go up anyway in the room elevators it seemed like overkill. For any extended stay this becomes more and more of an annoyance. Fourth Dining. We did not eat at their fine dining restaurant so no review for that. The more casual restaurant for breakfast and lunch was just fine good selections and a breakfast buffet. Plus twenty four hour room service. No complaints here. Fifth Location. Excellent. Just steps away from the French Quarter right on Canal Street. Walking distance to everything. Very convenient.

We splurged and upgraded to the Club Lounge Level which truly enhanced our stay. The Ritz was also a high notch above anything our fellow conventioneers experienced at the hotel closer to the event site. Bourbon Street is a 2minute walk and high end shopping is only 5 minutes. The dining and bar lounge facilities in the hotel were excellent. Taxis were readily available which was important because it rained part of each day during our stay.

I stayed unexpectedly at the Ritz for three nights while in town for a conference. I booked the Ritz last minute when I found out the hotel I had booked was not what I had expected. I do not know if it was the last minute booking but I got a very good price of 250 night for a king room. I have to confess here that I have always wanted to stay at a Ritz Carlton. Usually they are too pricey for a business traveler. The lobby is on the third floor so just take the elevator from the street level. In the June heat the common areas were cool and smelled divine burning candles were everywhere. I was warmly welcomed and allowed to check in several hours early. The bellman brought my bags immediately to my third floor room. Usually I bring my own bags but the wheel had broken off of my suitcase so this was much appreciated. The room was a good size for a downtown hotel which in my experience tend to be small. There was a lovely table to park my purse at the room entrance. The room had a desk area with plenty of outlets and lightning fast internet. The king bed was amazing. The room came with a mini bar that I did not use. But there was also a coffee maker. The bed was incredibly comfortable along with the high thread count sheets. There was also a comfy lounge chair and ottoman. The room would have been plenty big for 2 people. The air conditioning struggled a bit to keep up with the heat outside but it was certainly cool enough. The room was very well soundproofed the only noise I heard at night was the occasional siren. The bathroom was large with a shower tub combo and some first rate toiletries. I always appreciate a lighted make up mirror and robes. The closet was also a good size with lots of hangers. I received turndown service every night which included chocolates and bottled water. The fitness center is on the first floor down a long hallway. Once I found it I was very impressed with all of the equipment. There is a spinning room as you enter that also includes weight machines including an ab machine very nice. The main cardio room had 4 Techno Gym elipticals 4 bikes and several treadmills. The elipticals I used all worked well. I took a peek at the resistance pool and Jacuzi. Again it looked very nice but I had not brought my swimsuit. The weight room had numerous weight machines and free weights. I got every bit as good of a workout at the Ritz as I do at my home gym. There were also chilled towels plenty of sanitizing wipes and water. And the gym is open 247. I loved the beautiful courtyard on the 3rd floor across from the lobby. There was some wonderful art work there. I have attached a few photos. I wish I could have spent more time here. We did have a few drinks in the bar one evening. The bartender was very friendly and we had numerous craft beers for under 50 including tipUpon leaving I tried to drag my broken suitcase down the 3 steps to street level. The doorman chided me and said do not you dare try to carry that. How sweet. You can not get much closer to Bourbon Street without being in the craziness of the French Quarter. The hotel is adjacent to Dauphine which had many nice restaurants.

These guests clearly were here to party and the Club Lounge was the place to be given all drinks are included. Loud noisy boorish guests occupied the lounge day and night and the noise level was incredible. Most Ritz Carlton Clubs we have used around the world are calm tranquil places where you can escape the hustle and bustle of the hotel. Here was the opposite. We took breakfast downstairs in the main hotel restaurant which was quieter and generally kept away from the bun fights in the Lounge itself. We appreciate that the noise level may be higher in the US to Europe but this was terrible. Why the hotel could not set aside one of their rooms for ordinary club level guests I do not know. Mind you with Bourbon Street around the corner maybe people come to New Orleans to get hammered.
