We spent three days this Labor Day weekend at the Embassy Suites and had a mixed bag experience. First the good stuff the hotel is in a great location convenient to everything in downtown Cincinnati. We walked across the bridge to the Reds game and there are tons of restaurants withing walking distance on either side of the river. The hotel was very crowded with lots of people in town for the Reds games and WEBN fireworks and the breakfast staff did a fantastic job keeping up with demand and kept the self serve food items full. They did a great job with the manager \u2019s reception as well. Our room was clean and spacious and we had a bit of a downtown view. On our 3rd night we had a clogged bathroom tub and the maintenance person came almost immediately and fixed it right away. The parking garage is slightly annoying because no matter what level you park on you can not access the hotel lobby directly. If you park on G3 you have to walk down a flight of stairs with your suitcases if you did n\u2019t drop them off out front first. and then you take the elevator up to the lobby. If you park on G4 you walk onto a landing but then have to take the elevator or stairs up to the lobby. It \u2019s a bit convoluted but not the end of the world. FYI \u2013 parking is 14 for self parking with unlimited in and out privileges. You just have to get your parking ticket validated at the front desk EVERY time you want to leaveOur biggest frustration came with regards to the internet in the room or lack thereof and the staff \u2019s response to our reporting of a problem. We arrived on Friday and our daughters needed access to WiFi to do homework. One of our daughters had an assignment that she had to post by midnight that evening. The WiFi signal was extremely weak in the room \u2013 she had to sit directly in front of the door to stay connected. My wife and I also had brought work with us and needed to connect during our stay. When trying to access the WiFi from the back bedroom the signal was so weak we could n\u2019t even get a prompt to connect to the hotel WiFi. When I explained to the front desk the problem two different people on two different occasions they kept telling me to try a different login. They did n\u2019t understand that I could n\u2019t even connect to get a login prompt. Finally they sent a maintenance person to the room and he walked around with his phone and said that everything was fine. so helpful. So on Saturday with some work to accomplish for the parents and homework for the kids that needed WiFi I tried to get help again. We had received a Welcome Diamond Member letter from the General Manager David Bowles who said if we needed anything to contact him at an email address provided in the letter. After striking out at the front desk twice as well as with the maintenance person I emailed David Bowles. It is now three days later and I still have yet to hear from him. Very disappointing Embassy Suites. So if you \u2019re looking for a great place to stay and do n\u2019t need internet in your room \u2013 this is the place for you.", "offset": [1596, 1672], "date": "2016-09-06", "cpt": "0", "category": "general"}, {"id": 5, "uid": "e13c438d-6c05-4053-bac6-13b209eaa44d", "sentence": "Friendly staff clean facility.

We would rate our stay 3 35 stars overall. When we first arrived about 10 minutes after check in time our room was not yet ready. The girl that checked us in was very friendly and gave us a key to go ahead and take our daughter up to the pool to swim until our room was ready. She instructed us to use the phone in the pool area to call down after about 20 minutes to see if our room was ready. The lobby of the hotel was beautiful of course no issues with cleanliness. The elevators were fast which was a plus. However once we reached the pool area it seemed to be a sharp contrast from the rest of the hotel. The pool area was very small cramped and disheveled. Dirty towels were all over the floor. Obviously we had not yet changed to get into the pool so we went into the bathroom in the pool area to change. The bathroom floor was covered in a good 2 of water it was very difficult to change. The bathroom area and door door frame was in a desperate need of painting the bottom of the door frame had serious rust and the sink had what looked like a blood stain in it. The door also barely shut and did not lock. After about 40 minutes of being in the pool the manager brought our keys up and told us our room was ready we really appreciated that so we did not have to drag all of our belongings back down to the deskUpon reaching our room we were very impressed. Luckily the pool area seemed to be the worst we would see of the hotel. Our room smelled lovely it was clean and the furnishings seemed modern and not worn down at all. The only thing our room could have used was a coat of paint on the bathroom door as it was pretty worn down on the bottom. The view was also beautifulWiFi was nonexistent even though we had the premium code. The managers reception was a nice touch. Chips crackers pretzel bread and a few dips. I would like to note that we had our 3 year old daughter with us and at one point one of the staff members bringing out the food David was carrying out a bowl of goldfish. We made a mention of how we needed to go back up and get my daughter some. I started to turn around and he came up to me with a plate of them for my daughter. That is awesome customer service and so nice of him to go above and beyond. We ordered room service later that night. It took about an hour to arrive which was normal the hotel was pretty full. The food was pretty good and the lady that brought it was very nice. No complaintsWe noticed that there were several items of trash and room services trays along our floor the next morning that never got picked up. Our little one almost tripped over it and it was not pretty to look at was surprised they did not have someone collect those overnight. Breakfast was pretty good and staff kept it replenished even through a pretty big crowd. Overall our stay was decent however it is pricey because of location and river view. Unfortunately because the pool area is a big concern for us with having a three year old we will not be back. We just did not feel like the river view made up for the lack of quality in the pool area which is a priority for us of course.

I stayed at the Embassy Suites Covington for 3 weeks during April for work. I stayed at this property last year for 3 weeks and thought I knew what to expect. However when I made my reservation on the telephone the staff did not make me aware of the renovation so the fact that the air was full of dust the day I checked in and the entire lobby was covered and blocked off was news to me. I also had no idea you could pick your room and wish I had requested riverfront considering I was there so long. During my 3 week stay I requested cleaning aprox 4 times. The first time I left the note on the pillowcase asking for the sheets to be changed and when I came back the bed was hastily made with the pillows a mess and the blanked on the floor. I do not think they ever vacumed and they never cleaned the sink which was a problem because neither the sink nor the tub drained. I stayed here last year and had the same problem with a nondraining tub and taking a shower every day with a bunch of water up to my ankles. They could not fix it last year so I did not bother calling about it this year. Several times they did not bother to restock the coffee which I would have appreciated. One of the phones in the room did not work. Again not worth calling about. The renovation sorely impacted the cocktail hour and the breakfast. The cocktail hour previously was very enjoyable and had a craft beer and other types of beers available. When you are stuck in a hotel for 3 weeks getting out of the hotel and having someplace to go is appealing. Now the cocktail hour was in a room that was also used for breakfast and they had only Bud Light and Sam Adams available. I tried the Sam Adams once and it tasted off. I could not finish it. I tried a white wine and same story. I did not go back to the cocktail. Last year when I was here with coworkers we met at the cocktail hour almost every day and had a blast. Breakfast again short shrift due to the renovation. Smaller room and the same room they had to use for weddings and such so several days you were eating at a communal table with whatever group happened to be visiting and the food selections and quality did not compare to last year. In 3 weeks you notice when the oatmeal is fresh versus reheated and it was never hot enough. The fruit was just sad. Underipe honeydew and canteloupe every day. The bagels frequently seemed stale and at one point all of the cream cheese containers were covered with brown gunk on the outside. No berries or pineapple like late last fall. Because the room was smaller than last year the staff was super on top of taking your plates. I would try to sit and read the paper and on average would get interrupted at least 4 times as the staff tried to clear my plates. I mainly just wanted to enjoy the paper in piece before going to work. The omelette station was awesome and the service friendly and top notch. The cleanliness was concerning. The second week I was there someone dropped some food on the second floor hallway carpet near the exercise room and it was literally there the entire week. A used bandaid on the 8th floor was on the carpet for days. Food dropped on the elevator was there for several days. I had a plate and silverware in my room the day I requested housekeeping and left a 10 tip. The plate and silverware was left on the floor outside my door for days. I finally moved it myself. It made you concerned about the overall cleanliness. I sincerely hope they upgrade the exercise room. It is an actual hotel room which has been converted to house 2 elipticals 1 treadmill a recumbent bike and some hand weights. People seemed ready to battle over the treadmill. My friend stayed at the Mariot and their exercise room was amazing. I was very jealous. The only reason that I did not instantly cancel when I saw the renovation and change to Mariot is that when staying for 3 weeks I need 2 rooms or I will go stir crazy. But that lack of ability to socialize with my coworkers in the lobby an enjoyable cocktail hour and a decent exercise room really added to the difficulty of surviving 3 weeks in Covington. I rarely encountered any hotel staff other than breakfast.

I know they paid for their food but so did we in our room rate. The non surly female bartender went out of her way to try and make things right with a pasta salad but no utensils to eat it with until we asked. Monday AM breakfast and no bananas. Once again we are out a familiar phrase by now. The rest of the fresh fruit was almost gone too so no replenishment there either for the late arrivers. Some of us are from a different time zone that makes early breakfast tough but do not punish us by running out of food. The oatmeal was too runny as well. Yes you can have a made to order omelet but some of us eat oatmeal and fruit for breakfast. The room itself was quiet and the beds were comfortable.

I have been visiting this property for business and also hold training courses there for the last three years. I like the property and I like Embassy Suites. This last trip when I arrived after a long flight I was informed that they had no room for me the hotel was oversold and that they were walking me over is the expression to another hotel for the first night and was not confirming that I would have a room the rest of my stay. Despite the fact that I had a confirmation number for my stay and despite the fact that I also rented a ballroom and catering for three days. This was outrageous to me. It very distressing and I let the management know it. To the credit of the general manager they corrected the wrong when they learned I was not just a hotel room customer but something more. So they ultimately handled it well. But what I learned is that if you are a diamond level or some such member which I was not and a normal guest the upper level member can bump you out if they call for a room. This is just unacceptable to me when I contacted the hotel directly to book it and had a confirmation number which apparently means very little. So beware when you book a hilton property.

The bed was another sight. Pulled the sheets back and dirty yellow stains and brown stains on sheets. The hair next to stain was not so bad but also in the tub. I decided any hotel who would try to sell this room would not be a hotel I will sleep in for three days. I stayed that night and we left at 545 am and headed back home.

I really was excited to spend some much needed away time with my husband and really wanted to stay by the river. I moved from Chicago to Ohio about 5 months ago and really missed walks along the lake. I choose to stay at Embassy suites for a number of reasons but that was the major one and I am so happy I did. When we got there to check in about 530pm the valet doorman was very nice he told us about the parking arrangements and welcomed us to the hotel. I went in and got to the front desk and was meet by Joyce who I found out was the front desk manager. She was very pleasant and very knowledgeable about the hotel. I had called earlier during the week to see if I could upgrade to a river view room and when I told her my name she let me know that it was her I spoke with and that she was able to upgrade us to a river view suite. She wished us a happy anniversary and we went up to our room. Once we got in to the room we found a beautiful set up of mixed nuts candied and champagne. It was a very nice surprise. Joyce did a great job making us feel welcomed and special. The overnight young lady at the desk was great as well very sweet and helpful. The breakfast was excellent. My husband and I woke up kind of late and rushing to make church the next morning but still wanted to grab breakfast so the chef was able to fix us a to go container with all the trimmings. That in itself was a big deal to us. I will highly recommend this Embassy suites if you are traveling to Cincinnati or Covington KY.
