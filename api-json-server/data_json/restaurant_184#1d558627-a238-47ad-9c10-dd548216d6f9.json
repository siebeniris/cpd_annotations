We were really looking forward to staying at the FCC in Angkor. Having visited Angkor Wat and Siem Reap numerous times and also having dined quite a few times at the FCC before we had very high expectations. Unfortunately these were not quite met. Whilst the rooms are beautiful and the hotel itself is stunning everything seems a little tired and not as well polished as it could be. Breakfast was a challenge every day something that could easily be resolved if the staff was trained properly. The fact that all the dirty dishes from dinner are piled up in a corner right by the entrance of the hotel just makes everything feel dirty and messy. We love the place and believe it has all the ingredients to make an outstanding hotel experience but it needs more love and care.", "offset": [463, 573], "date": "2015-01-06", "cpt": "0", "category": "restaurant"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "3b673487-0d57-44f5-b40b-a49f8d4e5b0f", "sentence": "Overpriced. I stayed in this hotel 6 years ago in a better room for 100 a night. This time I paid 250 for a lesser room 450 on New Years Eve.

We visited in early January 2015. The room was a bit old fashioned. Very dark wood. Leaking toilet. Although the staff did respond fast on the two occasions it needed fixing. The was a blind which was quite effective in making the room very claustrophobic. However the alternative was to open the whole frontage of the room to free view for all passers by. When you arrive at the hotel the reception is very small and you are shoulder to shoulder with people leaving or with other guests. All pretty cramped. The pool is very poorly designed. There is virtually no sun as the sun beds are on the wrong side of the pool. The worst and most surreal experience was breakfast. There is no buffet. So you just get a set menu. No top ups of juice or tea coffee. The choice was two items of a very limited menu eg cereal and toast or hot meal.

Apart from the problem of the hotel not having our booking when we arrived our 3 night stay here was perfect. The hotel is beautiful. Because of the mix up we ended up with a family room which was absolutely huge. Fresh fruit was brought to the room each day together with lotus blossoms. The staff are all really friendly. The food was wonderful and really well presented. The hotel is right on the river. The market is about a 10 minute walk away where you can buy all kinds of souvenirs. Pub Street is about 15 minutes walk away which is worth visiting at least one night while you are there. There are numerous tuk tuks around which all seem to cost 3 wherever you want to go.

The staff are lovely really welcoming helpful friendly and professional.
