I would highly recommend the Shelbourne. It is a very nice hotel that has been around for a while but with all of the amenities and updates you had expect. The staff was very friendly and very helpful when checking our bags when arrived early and holding them the day we checked out while we went to see a show. The concierges were extremely helpful in recommending awesome restaurants that were local favorites and close by. The evening wine social was perfect and gave us the chance to meet new people. The rooftop is awesome we went up every day and night to see a 360 view of the city which overlooked the Chrysler building and Empire State Building among others. The room double deluxe was spacious and included a large bathroom and kitchen area with a coffee maker oven microwave sink and refrigerator with ice. The location was perfect for us. a few blocks up is Grand Central Station which made commuting to SoHo and The World Trade Memorial a breeze and we were in walking distance 5 6 blocks from Rockefeller Plaza Times Square Bryant Park Empire State Building Macys Saks and everything in between.

We arrived excited to enjoy our weekend in the city. The kidos love NYC and hotel stays just makes visiting the city even beterwe have stayed at other Afinia hotels beforefew years back and were looking forward to an exceptional overall experience at the Shelburne. We were happy to check in and drop off our bags earlier than the scheduled check in. Our room was very clean however the extra bedding I requested for the pull out couch for kids was not available but we did check in early so it is understandable. Our beds were very comfortable we felt like we were sleeping on clouds. The next morning we woke up nice and refreshed ready for more adventures. We ordered room service for breakfast and we were more than happy with that overall experience from the order to the fast delivery and delicious food. The Shelburne did not meet my expectations but I was pleased with our time there. The only little complaint I had was that on one occasion there was an excessively drunk man vomiting in the main entrance of hotel. He vomited on glass doors outside then back inside the entranceway. I guess he was drinking at the attached bar restaurant RARE. HE MISSED US BY seconds.

Stayed here for a quick 3night New York trip with my girlfriend. Check in went fine and we got to the room. Room was absolutely fine and super spacious for NY standards an all in all what expected. Then we decided to go for a walk and a bite after a long transatlantic travel. Put my belongings in the safety box just to realise that the battery of the safety box was out. Informed the reception and the maintenance came nicely in less than 10min. The maintenance guy did probably his absolute best but could n\u2019t find a solution in 1hr and after three different stints into our room. Then the maintenance guy came with a portable safety box not bolted into the wall as the original one and as safety boxes usually are. I did n\u2019t really like the idea of a portable one and went then to reception to discuss alternative solutions. I told the receptionistdiferent one that did the check in about the matter but she was not willing to understand why I did n\u2019t like the portable safety box as \u201d. how do you think that anybody could access the room \u201d. Obviously that is highly unlikely but is n\u2019t the safety box totally useless in the first place then. I just want to have my passports etc. safe and the insurance company probably does n\u2019t like me if something happens and I did n\u2019t utilize a proper safety box. Receptionist still refused to understand me \u201d I do n\u2019t understand what you are saying \u201d at this point I have to mention that even though not being a native english speaker I consider my level of English being perfectly sufficient and something I use everyday professionally. Finally I asked what we should do about this matter and she said \u201d I can not help you a manager is here in 15min and will have more authority \u201d. At this stage we had lost 15 2hrs of time in New York and it \u2019s safe to say that the being awake for 2hr did n\u2019t help my frustration levels. I then asked if we could just do a room move to make an easy solution and the receptionist did that right away. I just do n\u2019t get why she did n\u2019t have any willingness to suggest anything herself apart from speaking with a manager. Machines do n\u2019t sometimes work and that \u2019s absolutely fine and it \u2019s nobodys fault. Also there was nothing wrong with the room as such so I do n\u2019t get why she was n\u2019t interested in helping me. Frankly all I just waited to hear was to have a room move but ultimately had to request it myself. Got the new room and everything was fine. This was probably the most ridiculous 2hrs I \u2019ve spent that would have been easily taken care of in matter of minutes in the first place. As I said things sometimes break and that \u2019s absolutely fine it \u2019s really what we do about it what matters. Also a \u201d sorry \u201d or similar from the staff would n\u2019t have been wrong either. I encountered the same staff member again the next day as our keys stopped working and she was still reluctant of any basic customer service skills. I \u2019m super guted that one member of staff can ruin the whole customer service of this property in my eyes. On the checkout day there were other personnel and they were as friendly as ever and throughout the stay the other personel were superb. Cleaning was neat everything absolutely fine.
