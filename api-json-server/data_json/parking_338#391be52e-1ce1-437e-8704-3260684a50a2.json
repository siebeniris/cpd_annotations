This is one of the more outstanding hotel experiences that we have had. We have stayed at many nice properties before. Including Trumps hotels in Atlantic City and some of the nicer places in Las Vegas but I do not think that any of them compare to the level of service provided at the Trump International at Central Park. After we checked in everyone remembered our names from then on out. Every time we walked in or out we were greeted by name. The staff was super friendly and attentive. I really can not praise the staff enough. The room was perfectly clean and the housekeeping was top notch. Anything we needed or requested was seen to with a great attitude. My wife and I are not really comfortable with people waiting on us hand and foot but the people at the Trump never made us feel weird if that makes sense. We are just normal people who enjoy luxury. We never felt out of place at this hotel. They provided a high level of service but we never felt out of place. This was our first trip to New York and we stayed here 4 nights. The hotel is in a great area too. Right on Central Park next to shops and restaurants at Columbus Circle and less than a mile from Museum of Natural History close to the MET too. Again I can not sing their praises enough. This is luxury service and attentiveness at its finest. Thank you to the staff for a great stay.

Now for the service Excellent. All of the staff were well trained and incredibly kind. One day I was dressed up for a meeting running late and it was down pouring. Without having to even ask for a cab the doorman kindly put me in the hotel car for a ride across town. The driver saw my umbrella was too small and he gave me his larger one which kindly saved me from the torrential rain \u2026. The best part of this hotel was having Jean George room service.

I feel like the experience would be elegant for a suburbanite who does not spend much time outside of standard highway hotels. As for NYC not impressed with anything. The only positive would be views of Central Park if you are facing the park. The rooms are a bit dated. They are clean but just boring. I had a lg suite yet the bathroom was cramped. There was no lobby to speak of just enough room for a front desk and a couple of chairs 4 I think. NYC hotels are typically spectacular in many respects with amazing lounge like lobbies with cocktail bars stylish settings etc. The rooms in most NYC hotels are stylish and modern. These were not. I went there for the views of the park which I got. I would not stay again. Also had construction start at 9 am somewhere below my room on my second day. Was NOT happy about that as I paid 130 for two nights with the intent of sleeping late each morning. Things like soap shampoo etc. was all Trump stamped but was not current with NYC standards in hotels there.

A bargain for this luxury level. I have visited New York several times a year for many years. The last few years much more often as my adult daughters and my mother in law now live in the city. Over the last few years I made Trump Soho my home away from home in New York and have previously written a review on TripAdvisor about that Trump property downtown. My daughters moved up town and thus I moved along with them. Although both my daughters live on the East side I decided to try Trump International solidly in the West a try. The main reason for choosing it was price. I wanted a full fledged 5 star hotel and my experience at Trump Soho over the last few years had been superb. Trump International was considerably less expensive than comparable hotels the Ritz Carlton the Pierre the Four Seasons and equally priced to hotels that in my opinion are either over rated the Peninsula or that have seen better times the Park LaneOur original trip was fro five days but a family illness and a sudden business opportunity kept us in New York for 10 days. The rooms are outstanding. Most have either a kitchenette or a full kitchen. The views are outstanding in either direction. The rooms were cleverly refurbished as some of the furniture do brings one back to 90s Trump bling. However carpeting and upholstery have been redone. The TV system is the best I have seen in any NY hotel. Yo can use Apple play or Google play on it. Room service is as good as in any truly 5 star hotel and the staff are super attentive and courteous. My only comment regarding the staff is that here you feel a certain fake charm as compared to Trump Soho where the staff feels genuinely happy and eager to help. The from desk staff is superb. They handled my request to extend my stay superbly and even suggested a way by which I could get a lower price. The only small criticism about the hotel is not about the hotel itself but about Nougatine. the Jean Georges run restaurant where breakfast is served. The food is superb but the hostess staff is truly terrible. Time and again we were kept waiting for a table. The first time I thought the restaurant must have been full but every time it turned out that the wait was for no evident reason as plenty of tables were free. These hostesses seem to prioritize activities other than getting customers to their tables quickly ignoring the fact that breakfast is a time when one is pressed for time. This one of New Yorks best hotels. it is a mystery why one can stay here for 30 or 40 less per night that at the Ritz Carlton nearby.

Gym was quite nice cleaning staff was particularly nice and thorough price was pretty fair liked the free newspaper the location was exceptional and my nihilistic view of the world obviated the need for me to pass political judgement on the hotels namesake ie who cares politics are a triviality. My only complaint was the food I ordered a breakfast with overeasy eggs bacon and potatoes and the eggs were a bit undercoked the bacon a bit burnt and potatoes overoiled. Later in the day I become a bit ill from the food but I accept a degree of responsibility given that I ordered overeasy eggs which I knew bears with it a risk of food poisoning regardless of the how well it was prepared. That said the rest of the meal could have been better prepared. I am currently in New York staying elsewhere and I am writing this review out of nostalgia for the Trump hotel. I am not nearly as pleased with the hotel I writing this review from and was reminded of my nice stay at the Trump.

Despite the name we really wanted to try this hotel after researching and reading the reviews. There were pros and cons. Pros Location is unbeatable with Central Park directly across the street and Shops at Columbus Circle right next dor Most of the rooms as we understand had been newly renovated by the time we stayed Oct 2018 We paid for an upgrade from a central park king room to a central park king suite which had beautiful views floor to ceiling windows and was very spacious felt like home away from home and even had a small kitchen with full appliances so we could go next door to Whole Foods and grab some groceries. Cons Despite celebrating a special occasion we were asked to pay almost 500 US for the upgrade to a suite Our room was not ready on time. We were told we could leave our luggage at the front and then return when the room was ready at 40pm. We returned at 60pm and our room was STILL not ready. We were tired and very disappointed by this. If we are paying over 140 night I expect to be able to check in at the very least at the stated check in time Our bags were still in the front near the elevators when we returned I did not feel safe about this as anyone could have came and taken some of our bags or personal belongings Although renovated the style of the rooms could have been updated to a more modern look instead the renovations feel a bit cheap Valet parking is very confusing all signs and reviews said to drive around to the side of the building for valet. The valet company seems to be separate than the hotel. There were no bellman at the valet and they did us a favour and let us go through some inner doors to cut through the building to get to the front desk rather than carry all of our luggage along the street and around the corner to the front entrance. When we returned after a late night the parking garage was closed. A bellman then told us we should have just come to the front of the hotel for the valet not to the side where the valet signs are wish we had been told this in the beginning by any of the staff.
