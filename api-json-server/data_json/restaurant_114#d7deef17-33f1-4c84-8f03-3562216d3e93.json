Great property set on a magnificent powdery white sand beach too beautiful for words. My Gulf front room offers a great view of the beach volleyball game.

The staff was very friendly. My favorite feature of the Ramada was a fabulous grotto pool 8 feet deep in some areas I loved that. Most hotelpols these days are too shallow.

Five star bartenders one star management facility. I recently visited The Island hotel and although I had an overall good experience thanks to the bar staff I came away with a few concerns. The specific reason I chose this property was because of the unique experiences offered by the beachfront and the grotto bars. I have a background in the service industry and have a thorough working knowledge of the way a proper bar should function. That being said nothing about these bars seemed functional for your bar staff. The bartenders however were able to mask these shortcomings with their obvious dedication hard work and amazingly positive attitudes. At one point I looked up and the only patrons at the grotto bar were young children and I thought this was quite an odd sight to see considering this was a bar. It seemed that the bartenders were constantly stuck making children \u2019s drinks and were unable to get to the adult customers who I assume would be paying twice the amount for their beverages not to mention would also know the proper value of tipping the entire livelihood of a bartender. I also noticed that there was nobody there to check on the bar staff and I personally watched the bartenders forced to leave the bar unattended in the middle of a busy rush to refill their own ice alcohol and supplies multiple times each day. I saw some people poke their heads in or walk up but leave without asking if the bartenders needed anything. I ca n\u2019t help but to assume these were managers and this to me is unacceptable considering the level of work these bartenders are putting in for them and the amount of money they are making for the property. As a boss myself I caution you guys never to take workers like this for granted. One of the days I was there a storm rolled in and despite the thunder and lightening the bartender still stayed at the bar. In a pool Of water.
