We stayed in the hotel in two separate occasions the first stay was for 2 nights where we stayed in Deluxe King room and the second one was for 3 nights as we checked out in between to go to Yosemite. The hotel is very well located in Union Square it is clean beautifully decorated with a touch of Japanese design. Check in process was seamless and smooth the newly renovated room is beautiful and modern although I do feel that the design of the bathroom for the Deluxe King could do with a bit of retouching. it looks a bit outdated not really matching the room design. Amenities in the bathroom were great and the room was always spotless. Although an ice machine was near to our room the room was pretty much soundproofed and we had great sleep. the view from the room was also beautiful not to mention the bed itself which was very comfortable. We ordered in room breakfast for the first two nights of our stay as breakfast did not come with the room rate and the Niko Breakfast was delicious and always beautifully presented. Unfortunately an incident happened right before we checked out during our first stay involving a front desk individual which I rightly complained to the Manager for but I was glad that it was handled so professionally she really took it seriously and it suggested to us how much the hotel overall really wants to value their guests. The manager sent us a personal letter champagne upgraded us to Imperial Club when we came back for the second occasion for 3 nights stay. the room was similar to the previous stay but the bathroom was gorgeous and there was a vanity area too. We also received a welcome back letter which I thought was a really nice touch. What really impressed us was the restaurant the breakfast at Anzu was delicious both Western and Japanese types and the service from every single staff in there was so professional polite and really made our day eg asking us for other orders such as pancakes which were not in the buffet. Having been to Japan a few times myself I thought the Japanese breakfast was delicious. We thought the touch of calling each and every guest with their surnames was really good and definitely does not happen in every hotel the service was so good that we even added tips even when breakfast was included in the room rate. The fitness club swimming pool and steam room were all clean and great.
