Overall I think this is a great choice for St Thomas but I have a few suggestions for travelers and the hotel. The hotel is on the opposite side of the island from the airport so it can take 45 50 minutes to go about 11 miles. This is an expensive place to stay. It is up there with some of the most expensive beach hotels I have ever stayed in. We upgraded to an ocean view which was an extra 100 per night but well worth it. If you can stay here on business that would be the way to do it. The hotel has incredibly nice staff. The restaurant staff was particularly friendly not just nice but truly friendly. Our room was lovely. The bathroom was large although I think more counter space instead of two huge sinks would have been better. The view from our balcony was beautiful. I would recommend staying away from the rooms next to the ice machine and staff closet Room 215 and anything above or below as it can be noisy. The restaurants are expensive. However we went to a mediocre restaurant in Red Hook and it was expensive too. The breakfast buffet at the Ritz Carlton is 35 per person. We ate at the Italian restaurant one night. The half portions of pasta are small but the salads and appetizers are generous. The bread and tapenade are good. It is nice to sit outside and eat on the patio. Not the best Italian but not bad either. While the hotel does not advertise it guests can and should eat at Palazo. This restaurant is located above the ownership units which are somewhat separated from the hotel. It has indoor and outdoor seating with views of the ocean. The owner of the restaurant made a point ot check in with us. The Tagine was very good as was the grilled artichoke. The Pad Thai was a bit spicy for our tastes. Service was very good. Guests should make it a point to go out on the Lady Lyndsey catamaran. We did the sunset sail and it was wonderful. The staff is great the appetizers are quite good and so are the drinks. Since you can not see the sunset from the hotel due to the direction it faces this is a great way to see the sunset. The guests on our sail were all very friendly and we got and shared some good tips about the area. One of the biggest complaints I have about the hotel is the pool and beach situation. There seemed to be too few chairs for the number of guests. Also although I love little kids most hotels of this caliber would have an adult pool. I was surpised at how many young children were at this hotel. The rooms have Nespreso machines which is a nice touch if you like little cups of espresso. Personally I think most people would prefer a Keurig or coffee maker. We had a car during our visit. It was nice to have the car during the day as the taxis are really open air trams and can be very crowded. Driving on the left is not too bad but driving at night is scary. If you stay at the Ritz Carlton you can not really walk anywhere to shop or eat. On the positive side the hotel is very close to the Red Hook ferry which takes you to St John. A day trip that is highly recommended. Overall I think this is a great choice on St Thomas if you do not mind the expense.", "offset": [603, 639], "date": "2015-04-24", "cpt": "0", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "942e3b35-43fc-49af-96b4-09d667db325b", "sentence": "Beautiful Property.

Stayed two nights in the Ritz on St Thomas. Had been at another very high end resort on a nearby island that we love always wanted to check out the Ritz St Thomas so stopped by for a couple of days. Wow amazing the difference in the attitude and friendliness of the staff between the place we were and the Ritz. Everyone we came in contact with here was happy friendly and very helpful. They all knew our name immediately somehow. I would give everybody an A. We rented a cabana for a day to treat ourselves and Michael who was our helper on the beach was tremendous very friendly and always available if needed although he was clearly running around a lot that day also helping others. Also Jose in Bleuwater was amazing. can not remember everybodys name but this place gives great personal service always with a smile. As to the resort its beautifully done great landscaping great pool. Our room was nice could not really see the beach. Beach is not the best due to some rocks in parts but very pretty and great snorkeling. Breakfast was wonderful and dinner at Bleuwater was great sitting outside looking at St John. I would rate this place a 45 and would give it a 50 and I really hate to say anything as we loved this place. but we were not in our room all day and housekeeping did not do such a great job dirty glasses left out coffee bar not refilled things not all put back in place. But that was not a real problem. I would highly recommend the Ritz Carlton St Thomas it is a beautiful resort but the staff really makes this place. The entire team is to be commended for their attitude and attention to their guests this is the way it should be.

It has been six years since my wife and I married. Focused on the advent of a new career our wedding was quick and elegant yet no time was given to go on a honeymoon. With our respective I Dos we embarked on our journey together. The years following passed gleefully enough filled with the many highs and lows joy and sadness that one would expect. Two boys added to the family equation in those years have provided exactly what one would expect of two energetic young men. We are happy and we are a family. As one would expect a slow and unseen plaque of stresses formed almost unfelt and rarely a bother. As the years passed without any vacations our eyes always looked out peering for anything that may make a good justifiable getaway. We tossed about our reasoning hashing and rehashing different possible scenarios wherein we would finally be able to escape together. Plan after plan was made and often fell apart shortly after their construction. We had the desire to go somewhere but in the end never went anywhere. In recent months stresses from work have begun to pour on wave after wave. Along with those stresses has been the pressure of selling a house and buying a new one. When home becomes a headache our next house is no sure bet and work is filled with uncertainty the unseen buildup of stress seeped out into every facet of our life no longer unfelt and anything but subdued. On one random Monday it was time. Time to go. Time to get away. Our anniversary was approaching again and this year it would not be allowed to pass without fanfare. With assurances from my local dog kennel to take the dogs and my mom on board to watch the boys I walked into the kitchen and told my wife to clear the schedule for the following week. With a bit of understandable confusion in her eyes she asked why this was. I told her we were going on a vacation. Finally. Given the many plans that had failed over the years she was in a bit of disbelief not fully believing that this was finally going to happen. She asked where we were going to go and I said that I was not sure but I believe that I had found a place. The Ritz Carlton on a little island that neither of us had ever been to Saint Thomas. That choice proved to be a turning point and a decision that in the end neither of us would regret. With a quick click of a mouse the anticipation began to build. What would this be like. What would it mean to us to finally get away. How would this feel. How would the kids react to us being away. What are we to expect from the resort. Was it worth the price. Certainly their name precedes them but what of this particular location. Would six years of building stress and anticipation years of unrealized desires and so on be finally satiated by this choice in destination. Allow me to skip ahead in the story and tell you this simple answer yesWe arrived kissed by the sun as we walked across the tarmac soaking up the foreign yet seemingly familiar and welcoming landscape. The island accents of the airport staff wafted across the air causing smiles to cross our faces. We were here. This is actually happening. Shortly we saw a man bearing a genuine smile and sharply dressed holding in his hand a tablet with our name on it. Our chariot awaited. With a brisk drive through the crowded market and cruise port area we ascended into the hills. Turn followed turn followed hill followed vista. Polite blurbs about local history and lore were offered up by our driver like a person updating a prodigal friend who had returned from a trip abroad. Humble dwellings scattered about our drive mixed in amongst the hills opening to views of unequaled beauty and mansions that called out their wealth with well appointed facades. The succession of views continued hypnotic in their flow. The island had us and we had not even arrived to the resort. We were drunk with smiles and hungry with anticipation. Another turn and we were there like a surprise we knew was coming but could not fully anticipate. What a spectacular surprise it was. The man at the guard house asked for our names and with a word we were in. Down the drive we slowly approached the grand entrance a luxurious porte cochere surrounded with tropical flowers and teaming with the most important factor of all the wonderfully skilled staff of The Ritz Carlton St Thomas. The greetings they provided made us both feel as though we were welcomed home by family happy that we were able to make it back for a visit. Their smiles were genuine. Their joy was palpable. Never have we met a staff of any sort with such honest conviction such noticeable dedication. The formalities were short and painless finalizing our payments and room selection. As we sat peering out onto the wonders of Great Bay we were delighted by an offering of rum punch. Those proved to be the perfect touch to start off our stayWe were then driven down a winding cart path sided by verdant gardens. We happily chatted with the bellman as he politely inquired about our vacation plans. Tucked neatly away far from the grand main entrance awaited our building. The bellman took our bags and showed us to our room the door hidden from view of the cart path and surrounding areas. As the door opened we were in resort heaven. The cool creamy marble floor lead elegantly into the main room wherein sat a table. Atop the stone of the table was a most surprising gift a bottle of champagne nestled in a bucket of ice that sat next to a decadent selection of confections with the plate having been written on Happy Anniversary. The most cherished piece of the display was a card that welcomed us congratulating us on our anniversary. They certainly made a wonderful impression on usThe tall sliding glass doors sided by elegant drapes beckoned us to the balcony. The cooling breezes of the island greeted us as we opened the door peering down onto the splendor of the resort and the azure waters of Great Bay. What a sight it was. We stood for happy moments absorbing the beauty concocting plans of how best to enjoy our time here. Venturing back into the bedroom the large king bed was tall covered in soft linens and pillows. The mattress was enveloping in its comfort and was truly rejuvenating. At the end sat a most useful bench to prepare ourselves. The room was light and elegant in its design and color palate capturing equal parts of the regal name of The Ritz Carlton and the honest beauty of the Caribbean. Back down the marble hallway in which we entered was the door that led to the bathroom. The name bathroom does not accurately conjure in ones mind what this room truly was. Spacious accommodations awaited us the two large sinks with their tasteful designs sat atop a broad countertop. Along its length sat a useful selection of toiletries and was far more comprehensive than I could have imagined. To the right of the sinks sat a deep soaker tub wonderfully surrounded by soaps and gels. The design of the tub was one with much thought to the user with handles placed to easily draw ones body from the warmth of the water. The shower was spacious and again offered a selection of soaps and gels. The toiletries provided were of unparalleled quality. Purple Water by Asprey of London quickly became our favorite in all categories provided to us. The scent was inviting and crisp yet relaxing. Their lotion has proven to be quite the new addiction being exactly what one expects from a lotion. To round off the rooms offering was a most useful espresso maker. It was used at numerous times throughout the day to add a spark to my step after being lulled by the sun and tequila. The room proved night after night to be the ultimate place for rejuvenation with each aspect well thought out and expertly executed. Down a short and quiet path that passed a babbling fountain and flowers of unknown names sat the entrance to the shining gem of the resort the oasis inside of the paradise The Club Lounge. Another subdued name that belied the wonders inside. Through the frosted doors we were greeted with sincere attention and warmth by the concierge. A quick tour revealed to us the many amenities that were offered from the decadent presentations of food from their expert chefs to the wines and liquors. The views and divine accommodations would prove to be an irresistible magnet to us time and time again. We can not speak highly enough of the expert skills of the Lounge staff and their amazing treats and dishes that tantalized us. Access to the Club Lounge is without question a new must have for us on our planned return trips. We can not recommend it enoughDown the steps adjoining the Club sat the beach. Its expertly manicured sands shown brightly in the midday sun and provided a muted warmth at dusk as the winds of the islands continued without ceasing. We witnessed each morning the level of care given to the beach a team raking the white sand even venturing into the water to catch stray bits of sea grass lest they taint their beach. Again each member of the staff worked with great purpose with dignity and focus. Along the beach sat many attractions from food and drinks to activities that would keep one busy for days. The chairs were comfortable and their beach staff was helpful and numerous. Exploring the waters of Great Bay revealed to me numerous colorful fish a large puffer that swam cautiously beneath me and conch too many in number to count. Every rock and every blade of grass seemed to have something upon it or behind it. For the truly venturous of which I am not one there are numerous spots to which one could easily swim and be even more astounded by the abundant life of the waters that surround and feed the island. Our days twice lead us to The Spa. If your body and soul were not already at peace by the joy and beauty of the island then the spa staff will see to it that you leave in a state of absolute bliss. The scents abound within the shop none proving offensive and selections of every sort await your trial and delight. The staff are wonderful in their skill from expert hands to warm smiles they proved on each occasion to be an amazing choice. We enjoyed manicures and pedicures on one day followed by a couples massage the following day. A visit upon our return is without questionWe had the distinct pleasure of meeting some of the management from different facets of the resort and each greeted us with genuine care and showed to us a magnificent level of professionalism. They truly do care about their guests and they seek to do what it takes to ensure your hapinesTo sum up our experience The Ritz Carlton. St Thomas is luxury and pleasure without parallel. They are experts in all that they do and it shows upon the faces of their guests as it did upon ours. They are a comprehensive team of professionals dedicated to your care and joy. For them to fail at nothing is an accomplishment unto itself but to be the superlative that stands out amongst the luxurious is truly a grand achievementTo the staff of The Ritz Carlton St Thomas thank you for all that you did. We can not wait to see you all again.

I started this review prior to Hurricane Irma so please keep that in mind. I was there a week before and I have no idea how things will be when it reopens. We stayed August 26 30 to be able to utilize The Ritz Carlton Club closes annually on September 1 for our 5th anniversary. We did not have our two young children but we are now always cognizant of children family friendly items. Our trip also coincided with the start of the slow season so live music St John restaurants etc were not very plentiful. Staff I can not say enough about the wonderful staff and their thoughtfulness. We were greeted by name and wished happy anniversary by numbers of ladies and gentlemen time and time again. Transportation Being our first visit to St Thomas we opted for The Ritz to handle our pickup and drop off at the airport. It is very expensive 190 each way but it is first class in a large black SUV that is only for you there is a lack of private transportation. No issues at all. and since I accidentally left my iPad in the SUV on the return trip the driver returned to the airport and paid a Delta employee to bring my iPad to me I was already through customs and securityRoms. The property was built in 196 and has had numerous renovations since then. Rooms were large with marble tile floor throughout and a nice bathroom separate shower and large bathtub. There was an issue with the safe and a closet door not remaining closed but those are minor inconveniences. There is a ceiling fan above the bed and helped to make it always feel fresh and inviting. The balcony was deep and large. There was room for a table two chairs and full length lounge chair on the balcony without feeling cramped. Only two items of note the walls seemed very thin. We had one neighbor and could hear just about everything in the next room. The can of Off insect spray that was in the closet may have been useful but it is still a bit alarming when the bell staff points it out at check in. Club. The Club Lounge is very nice and the staff is excellent. There is a corner of the club setup for kids with toys smaller tables and chairs etc a great addition. The adult section of the room is just around a corner but it was always warm hot on that side. Two freestanding fans were in the area to move the air but they were not nearly capable. One or two of the room ceiling fans would have done the trick honestly. The patio of the club is very nice but once again limited air movement. Two large fans or something similar would be great. The food was good but not as plentiful as some other clubs I have been to over the years. At breakfast there was not a station to make a mimosa or even any alcohol at all. I requested a bloody Mary each morning and only a single staff person knew how to make one. That seemed odd too. After 11 am the alcohol was put out and no less than 10 kinds of rum were available. In the evening there were a few main stays of liquor but Jack Daniels being the only whiskey bourbon seemed odd also. Overall a great great club that missed one or two little things. Pool Beach Awesome pool and beach with full service at both. The pool is large with an infinity edge to the bay and views to St John. Both the pool and beach normally had a nice breeze that was very much welcomed. Restaurants. We utilized the Club for breakfast so I am no help there. In the evenings we ate on the property at Bleuwater and Esenza. Bleuwater is the steakhouse and the food was good and service pleasant. They had a new executive chef that we met. As for Esenza it was our favorite restaurant on our trip. My wife asked for a variation of a dish on the menu no issue and no additional charge. I had the Bolognese and it was excellent. Quick note the entire property uses the same wine list which is a bit expensive but good selection. Other notes No sales tax and duty free under 160. so we visited the Little Switzerland jewelry store and found a great watch for my wife and on sale. David Yurman John Hardy etc were all there with a great woman Kristin that was incredibly helpful. Overall We had an incredible time and would love to go back. As I stated at the beginning Hurricane Irma has now severely hurt the island but I am hopeful everyone is safe and the property will be rebuilt to its normal splendor.", "offset": [1011, 1210], "date": "2017-09-13", "cpt": "0", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 10, "uid": "774c1cac-7661-40ae-975a-8ab10fbec773", "sentence": "A beautiful but inconvenient vacation. I traveled to the US Virgin Islands in August for five days with my family. Overall the resort was great except for a few issues. When my mom booked the hotel it said that they had concierge services along with a few other accommodations. We called the front desk about a week before our vacation to ask a few questions. We wanted to know the distance between the airport and the hotel stuff about the tours we scheduled those kinds of questions. My mom later found out while calling the hotel that they had limited services which we found surprising as this was such a beautiful and prestigious resort. The description of the Ritz Carlton did not state that they had limited services all that was said was that there was construction. On top of it all the woman who answered our call was quite rude. My family was quite shocked and we reported this to our travel agent. The travel site that we used apparently had no idea that accommodations at the Ritz were so minimal. We were given the chance to cancel and find another place to stay but it was too late. The remaining options were either fully booked or we simply did n\u2019t like it. We decided to stay at the Ritz and enjoy our vacation without stressing over the lack of important services. We arrived on August 23 at the airport and rode a taxi to the Ritz. The drive was approximately half an hour by the way. We arrived at around 20 and were taken to our room. The lady at front desk was a little rude but that was okay. As soon as we walked in we noticed the room was beautiful but quite dusty. It was as if it had n\u2019t been aired in ages. The room we booked was ocean view so at least we could see the water. I have asthma and so we requested to be moved to another room. We were and it was better we just could n\u2019t see the ocean as well. A few minutes later we went swimming in the pool. It was beautiful. The beach was nice as well. The housekeeping services were good and the lady who cleaned our room was nice. The restauraunt had good food but the menu was pretty limited. The construction workers were quite loud but that did n\u2019t bother us since we spend the day swimming and exploring and the workers are absent at night. The campus was very nice and the plants were exotic and beautiful. Generally the resort looked amazing aside from the construction areas. I understand that the US Virgin Islands were hit pretty hard by the hurricanes last year so the lack of accommodations were excused. It \u2019s very unfortunate that such a beautiful place was destroyed. I \u2019d really love to see the resort operating fully in the future. On August 27 we left the Ritz Carlton.

This hotel is not ready to reopen. Welcome Home. That is what we are used to hearing when we check in at a Ritz Property. We book club level because they know I want unsweet ice tea my wife has a gluten sensitivity and they make sure to accommodate her without asking. My grandsons adore the Clubs chocolate chip cookies. We have stayed at many Ritz properties and the service is always a level above any competitor. The Ritz Carlton St Thomas however is not up to any civilized standard for a hotel let alone a Ritz property. This particular property was a victim over 2 years ago of Hurricane Irma and Maria. The property has been closed until recently to go through a 100 M renovation. When we heard they were re opening we booked a trip for us our kids and grandkids as a Christmas present to the family. We always stay on club level so we booked club level rooms. We arrived at the hotel on Tuesday Dec 3rd only to discover that club level is not ready and will not be open for month or more. We were very disappointed because club level is where we congregate as a family on our trips together. The Ritz should have notified us in advance so that we could have made other plans if desired. They did not do so. We also had to wait in line for nearly 20 minutes to check in because they had only 1 person handling check in. They then check us in and send us to our rooms on the 5th floor of E building. They had not bothered to tell us that the elevators in the building did not work. Climbing the hill from the beach to the rooms and then having to climb 5 flights of stairs in addition is not easy for an old fat guy like me. I called to talk to a manager and waited nearly an hour for a call back before I decided to go address my concerns in person. When I arrived at the lobby I found the elevators were not working there either. In fact we have had trouble walking the sidewalks around the resort because they are re tiling portions of them. Construction is going on all over the property and they expect their guests to tolerate the noise. They have hired someone to play music all day long at the old pool and beach to try to cover up the noise but they have to keep the volume too high for some of the guests comfort to accomplish that feat. We have found that the level of service at this Ritz property is not up to Ritz standards not even close. Ritz keeps a comprehensive database on their customers so they know how to attend to them. The concept they push is that if you have to ask it is not service. Currently at this property you have to ask multiple times. Our safe did not work. It had a battery issue. We called Wednesday morning asking they replace the battery. Nothing happened. We called Wednesday evening asking they replace the battery. 30 minutes later someone shows up and then has to leave to get a battery because he did not bring one even though we reported the error. At the same time they elected to fix a light in our hallway that was broken. When we returned from dinner the light was working and hanging from the ceiling. Nice touch. Today we left at 730 am to go on an all day boat charter. We returned this evening to find that neither our room nor our kids room had been cleaned. I called the concierge to get housekeeping but instead had the phone answered by in room dining. I ended up talking to the in room dining manager and he was simply no help. I called and requested to speak to a manager and then got fed up and walked to the lobby to see him in person. He was in a meeting. He did come to my room shortly afterwards and once again promised to make things right. I told him that I was not looking for any special treatment. I simply wanted the service I expect from a Ritz property. I explained that thus far I have received much better service at many Mariot Courtyards. I am not looking for freebies I am not looking for discounts I do not mind paying for service. that is why I have been a Ritz customer for years. However at this property that service is not remotely close to what we have become accustomed to at Ritz Properties. The staff is poorly trained. They do not have enough personnel working in some roles to handle guest volumes. The property is under construction so key facilities such as the elevators are not working. Ritz Carlton should have never opened this property in the condition it is in and they should have been much more extensive in the training of their staff.

This hotel is not ready to reopen. Welcome Home. That is what we are used to hearing when we check in at a Ritz Property. We book club level because they know I want unsweet ice tea my wife has a gluten sensitivity and they make sure to accommodate her without asking. My grandsons adore the Clubs chocolate chip cookies. We have stayed at many Ritz properties and the service is always a level above any competitor. The Ritz Carlton St Thomas however is not up to any civilized standard for a hotel let alone a Ritz property. This particular property was a victim over 2 years ago of Hurricane Irma and Maria. The property has been closed until recently to go through a 100 M renovation. When we heard they were re opening we booked a trip for us our kids and grandkids as a Christmas present to the family. We always stay on club level so we booked club level rooms. We arrived at the hotel on Tuesday Dec 3rd only to discover that club level is not ready and will not be open for month or more. We were very disappointed because club level is where we congregate as a family on our trips together. The Ritz should have notified us in advance so that we could have made other plans if desired. They did not do so. We also had to wait in line for nearly 20 minutes to check in because they had only 1 person handling check in. They then check us in and send us to our rooms on the 5th floor of E building. They had not bothered to tell us that the elevators in the building did not work. Climbing the hill from the beach to the rooms and then having to climb 5 flights of stairs in addition is not easy for an old fat guy like me. I called to talk to a manager and waited nearly an hour for a call back before I decided to go address my concerns in person. When I arrived at the lobby I found the elevators were not working there either. In fact we have had trouble walking the sidewalks around the resort because they are re tiling portions of them. Construction is going on all over the property and they expect their guests to tolerate the noise. They have hired someone to play music all day long at the old pool and beach to try to cover up the noise but they have to keep the volume too high for some of the guests comfort to accomplish that feat. We have found that the level of service at this Ritz property is not up to Ritz standards not even close. Ritz keeps a comprehensive database on their customers so they know how to attend to them. The concept they push is that if you have to ask it is not service. Currently at this property you have to ask multiple times. Our safe did not work. It had a battery issue. We called Wednesday morning asking they replace the battery. Nothing happened. We called Wednesday evening asking they replace the battery. 30 minutes later someone shows up and then has to leave to get a battery because he did not bring one even though we reported the error. At the same time they elected to fix a light in our hallway that was broken. When we returned from dinner the light was working and hanging from the ceiling. Nice touch. Today we left at 730 am to go on an all day boat charter. We returned this evening to find that neither our room nor our kids room had been cleaned. I called the concierge to get housekeeping but instead had the phone answered by in room dining. I ended up talking to the in room dining manager and he was simply no help. I called and requested to speak to a manager and then got fed up and walked to the lobby to see him in person. He was in a meeting. He did come to my room shortly afterwards and once again promised to make things right. I told him that I was not looking for any special treatment. I simply wanted the service I expect from a Ritz property. I explained that thus far I have received much better service at many Mariot Courtyards. I am not looking for freebies I am not looking for discounts I do not mind paying for service. that is why I have been a Ritz customer for years. However at this property that service is not remotely close to what we have become accustomed to at Ritz Properties. The staff is poorly trained. They do not have enough personnel working in some roles to handle guest volumes. The property is under construction so key facilities such as the elevators are not working. Ritz Carlton should have never opened this property in the condition it is in and they should have been much more extensive in the training of their staff. I can site a myriad of small examples as well but suffice it to say this property is not close to Ritz standards and every guest we have talked with agrees.

We ignored him and took a look around and found the Little Switzerland store open. Other staff members confirmed the hotel has not yet finished their renovations and it is not open to the public.

I really do not like giving average or negative reviews especially in this case because the staff is super kind. I just feel like the hotel needs to be aware of some things. First of all we had a very welcoming greeting when we arrived. We were brought drinks immediately upon our arrival while we checked in. After check in they gave us an additional. It was a sweet gesture to start our stay off right. During check in we were told that we would be given a 200 resort credit per night because the hotel still is not completely finished. This was a great surprise and a very kind gesture. We were in Puerto Rico staying at the St Regis over Christmas before we came here. it is hard to not compare the two. We read TripAdvisor reviews on this hotel and our expectations were not very high so being told we would be credited was a very nice surprise. We arrived at our room and while it was okay it was not anything fancy. Much smaller than the room we stayed in at the St Regis. Beds were comfortable and we had a deck which was nice. Although the Ocean View room we had was more of a view of the construction of the pool. We did not spend time out there since it was mainly construction. As for the shower in the bathroom it seems odd that it is frosted glass that you can see into the main room. So you can see someone showering or at least the shadow of them. There was also light from the shower so if others are still sleeping in your room its not dark. Being a Ritz I would have expected better. The first night we ate at Coconut Cove. Nakita was our server and she was very friendly. My husband ordered a seafood pasta with Lobster mussels clams and shrimp. My daughter and I had the chicken pasta. The chicken pasta was absolutely delicious both my daughter and I loved it. As for the seafood pasta there was no lobster and barely any mussels or clams. It was mainly shrimp. When my husband questioned it the manager asked the chef and he said he was out of lobster. That is fine but they should have told us that because it was 14 more for the lobster. They offered to take it off our bill but my husband said no it was still good and since he ate it he suggested to just charge him like it was a chicken pasta which they did. I am only pointing this out because of what happens a few days later which I will talk about below. The guys and gals working the pool were super friendly and helped get your chairs set up. Christmas is a busy time but we never had issues finding chairs. There were plenty. Lunch at the pool took over an hour to receive which seemed like a long time so just order before you are too hungry. Most restaurants require reservations before you arrive because when we got there they were all booked for dinners. The breakfast buffet restaurant near the pool was good although you could tell the wait staff were extremely stressed and overwhelmed. The second day we ate here there was quite a wait. We told them we would be waiting outside and they said they would come out and let us know when our table was ready. As we saw people behind us in line getting seated my daughter went up and questioned and the lady was not very kind and said we have been calling your name for awhile. My daughter quickly reminded her that we told her we were waiting outside since there was no room to wait inside and that she agreed to come out to tell us when our table was ready. They sat us next. New Years Eve lunch we decided to eat at Coconut Cove again because we wanted the chicken pasta. Nakita was our waitress again and we were happy to see her. My husband ordered a bacon cheeseburger. She asked what kind of cheese and he said swiss. She came by our table shortly later and my husband questioned if saw that it said bacon on the cheeseburger. She said he was accurate and there would be bacon. So out comes his cheeseburger and my husband jokingly said this is the orangest swiss I have ever seen. Nakita felt bad and said she would take it back and fix it immediately. My husband told her no it is not a big deal he likes cheddar too. She leaves and my husband realizes there is no bacon. So when she comes back he tells her and you can tell she is completely embarrassed. She brings the bacon. My husband then started eating the burger and after a few bites he realizes there is something in his burger. Sure enough it was the wax paper that divides the cheese. He calls Nakita over and she looked mortified. She asked to put it on a plate to show the chef. My husband was done eating at this point. When our bill was brought to us we thought for sure they would take his meal off especially since my husband did not have them take off the pasta off the first night like they asked. We thought it was only fair since he had wax paper in his burger that he be comped that. So he scratched off that part of the bill and did a new total. When we received our final bill we saw that they did make the adjustment on their end which was good however it should have never been on the bill in the first place. That night we went out to eat in town. When we came home there was a bottle of champagne and a very kind note from Nakita. That was great customer service and they definitely tried to right their wrong. We were thankful for that even though we do not drink champagne. On our last morning there we had to get up early for our taxi and when I went to shower I realized the staff that serviced our rooms forgot to leave us any fresh towels. They took all of our old towels during turndown service but forgot to leave new towels so we did not even have hand towels. It was about 7 am and I called housekeeping and they never answered I called the front desk concierge and they never answered. Since we all needed to be up and showered it was quite frustrating no one answered their phones. I had to call the bell desk to ask for towels. They said they would be right up. They arrived at 830am. Luckily our flight was delayed by several hours so it was okay it took them so long for the towels to arrive. I do feel there should always be someone available answering phones for guests though. We were eaten alive by the sand flies so be sure to use the Off they have for you near the pool. My daughter stopped counting at 100 bites on her body. Red bumps welts that were super itchy. Ok back to the good. The water is beautiful there is coral and rocks in the water but we still got in and my son and husband did some snorkeling. That was fun for them. The sand is super soft and when you are not looking at the pool construction the view is stunning. I loved looking out to St John. I would return. I just hope they get some of these kinks worked out soon especially when I had to use more than the usual points for our stay for a hotel that was not quite ready. Once the family pool is completed it will be great.", "offset": [5873, 5919], "date": "2020-01-16", "cpt": "1", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 17, "uid": "f32ad2ce-4993-47b5-8a10-8d65178c5feb", "sentence": "Service not up to par for a Ritz Carlton property. We just returned from a 5 night stay at the Ritz Carlton St Thomas staying in an oceanfront queen bedroom. With Bon Voy Ambassador status and previous Ritz stays my expectations were high but tempered by recent reviews and understanding that they are still recuperating from the hurricanes. However we were extremely disappointed with the consistency of service offered. We take this special trip every other year and were extremely disappointed with our stay. From the beginning we were not able to reach anyone at the hotel via phone or email to answer questions related to the reservation. One time that I did talk to someone it took over an hour on the phone to attempt to change our room type. After leaving several messages and emails for a concierge no one ever responded. Eventually our Mariot Ambassador was able to confirm everything for us before we arrived. While the check in process was simple through the ap and the welcome lovely after several calls to the front desk we were told that we would need to pay an additional 350 night for access to the Club Lounge regardless of the lifetime status. We made several requests at the concierge desk the pool deck and over the phone to reserve a pool cabana and never received any response. Half of the time when we would call for reservations or room service no one would answer the phone at all. While lounging at the beach the service was spotty and inconsistent at best. There was an issue with the Sails kitchen which prompted a very limited menu for lunch and food being prepared next to the pool beach on grills under a tent. I was not expecting just one restaurant on property to be available for meals. Our room was on the 5th floor of building E and with only one elevator on the other side of the building I would not recommend this hotel for anyone with mobility issues. There are stairs everywhere throughout the main building to and from the pool and the beach etc. The construction of the family pool was very disruptive. It was visible from every room and the hotel attempted to disguise with music that started early each morning on the pool deck with the same playlist each day. The construction definitely cuts into the pool deck and you need to reserve your pool loungers early in the morning if you want a place to sit. At the beach you need to reserve a chair early in the morning if you want to sit in the front row. The attendants were friendly but not helpful even with tips. There just did not seem to be any focus on the customer experience at this resort. A couple of staff members were very friendly Lisa from in room dining was a delight each morning but not able to hold the rest of the resort to the same standards.", "offset": [921, 1162], "date": "2020-01-29", "cpt": "1", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 18, "uid": "ede2f347-dfa3-441e-b304-1583f3652afe", "sentence": "Not so Luxurious Ritz Carlton. My fianc\u00e9 and I are frequent Ritz Carlton vacationers this was our first time at the St Thomas resort and sad to say it will be our last as well. After reading reviews we understood that the hotel is just starting to come back together after the huricane renovation. Upon arrival to the hotel our check in process was very strange. We were kind of brought around to different areas of the lobby until we were sat down and someone came over to help us. It seemed like staff was unsure what to do with us. We did not like that our bags were sitting in a pile of other peoples luggages outside the hotel until our room was ready. Mind you we absolutely love the Ritz located on cayman island and all their other properties. Our hotel tour guide was great in showing us around and answering general questions. The view from the resort is stunning in itself. It was pouring our first day so we were looking to browse the shops at the hotel do anything however only their jewelry store is open all the other shops are not yet ready. To my knowledge there is no arcade or really much else to do besides lounge at the pool beach activities and excursions. Calling concierge the staff was not very knowledgeable on what stores are open which surprised us. Also we were being called by the wrong last name our entire trip do not know what was up with that. We had club access where we spent a lot of our time having drinks and munching on snacks which was nice. Our first night we ate at Bleu water restaurant the atmosphere was bland decor was lacking it came across like more of a family restaurant less of a romantic feel we were trying to go for being a steakhouse. Our food took over an hour to come out. However our food was tasty. Our next day we reserved a cabana by the pool which was nice. When we got to the pool area I let staff know we have a cabana reserved and we were told oh no they are all reserved I let them know I reserved mine a week before our trip then I was led to my cabana which was not set up yet. It was 11 am they rent out from 9 am for the day. Service was just ok. The beach is not the most enjoyable due to all the coral sea grass. This is definitely not a pure white sand beach Incase that is what you are looking for. Only one pool is open right now so everyone is congested into one area. There is a slide being built which looks fun for the kids. I highly recommend taking the ferry over to trunk bay beach in St John it was the highlight of our trip. That beach is beautiful pure and memorable. Pros. Staff was very very kind. They can drive you anywhere via golf cart should you choose not to walk. I truly feel bad writing this review because staff is so so nice however they were poorly trained lacking guidance. The room was clean and newly renovated. Bathroom was extremely spacious perks for water toilet having its own door. The property was beyond beautiful and everything is just a close walk away. Cons besides everything I mentioned already bathrobe was dirty with makeup smears. Food not good. Served raw food twice on our trip. Overall we love staying at the Ritz properties we love being club level. however there are nicer Ritz caribean locations than st Thomas they still need to get their act together here a bit to say the least. Nothing to quite rave about just yet. Food options could be better. Service at coconut cove was very strange my food was raw food is not Ritz Carlton quality. Room service food quality was not good plates came dirty and food did not look pleasant to eat. A Ceasar salad at the ritz should not be salad from a bag with bagged shredded cheese soggy pieces of bread serving as croutons and bottled dressing. Our room service chicken fingers were completely raw pink. My husband got sick. The kids can get sick this way. Where is the ritz quality. This luxury hotel giant is going down hill. No longer luxurious ritz Carlton.
