Great rooms and great facilities. Many diversions amazingly friendly and dedicated staff overall 1010The food for example it is great to see a Hotel in the Maldives that has a great Indian restaurant amazing quality of meat be it steak or spare ribs and a huge variety of Italian and Asian cuisine. The breakfast buffet is amazing excellent bakery noodles eggs and so on. You can stay for 2 weeks and you will not get bored of the food. The overall location it is only 40 minutes by boat from the airport so no need for additional flights or even the need to stay at a hotel in Male overnight. Some of the best dive sites in the Maldives are just around the corner too. The facilities Be it sports entertainment dining kids club and babysitting quiet areas for adults or crazy water sports. You can have it all. Or you can just lie on the beach in front of your bungalow and feel like you are the only person on the whole island except for the friendly guy who stops by with an ice cream on the house once in a while. The staff. The staff is dedicated interested friendly entertaining and always extremely friendly and helpful. It really makes you feel appreciated without anyone being overly subservient or trying to be your best buddy. They are there to make your stay nice they know that and they are good at it. The bar is also great good and different drinks good and different snacks friendly and prompt service good music be it with a Shisha or a game of pool.

I had a dinner at Cafe Kuda with international cuisine. I definitely can say that seafood broth and grilled ox tail dish were perfect and if you are especially Korean you should try the seafood broth.

The instructors were very enthusiastic happy to help patient with every detail of safety technique. We also took a short boat ride over to the very tranquil spa had a Couples massage session which was wonderfully relaxing.

We stayed in April at the Four Seasons Kuda Hura in the sunset villa. This is my fourth trip to the Maldives and I have to say that this property is the worst amongst all those that I have visited before. I almost regret not going back to any of the previous properties and instead relying on the Four Seasons name for this trip. I stayed previously at Anantara Dhigu Jumeirah Vitaveli and the W Hotel each of these hotels have exceeded my expectations one way or another. Except the Four Seasons which makes this experience very disappointing. I will focus mainly on the issues that require MAJOR improvement1. The room is very basic and small. do not expect luxury. This is the first category of rooms and I get that. But other hotels have a luxurious feel even to their first category rooms. Something that we definitely missed in this hotel. 2. The beach outside the room is Extremely rocky and full of dried corals. You can not enter the sea without being hurt. it is very unpleasant. None of the previous hotels that I have been to in the Maldives had this issue. I called the reception and asked why this was the case and they indicated that there is an area good for swimming next to the main pool. This is confusing cause if I paid to come all the way to the Maldives then I expect to be swimming infront of my villa. Again another disappointment given our previous fantastic experiences. 3. My sister called before arrival with a few days to explain that we are marking an important celebration hence the trip to the Maldives. There was no acknowledgment whatsoever. Maybe I am too pampered with the excellent service that the Starwod Hotels provide that I expect the same everywhere. There was a handwritten welcome note in the room I would have been impressed if there was an acknowledgment to our occasion in that handwritten card. Again so much to learn on customer service from the Starwod Hotels Group 4. The snorkeling is a BIG fail. You can only snorkel on one side of the island and you barely see fish. No turtles no starfish. Even the variety of fish is not that great. We were informed that we have to go on a boat trip in the middle of the sea to snorkel properly of course for a price. Once again we did not have to go anywhere further than our door step in the other hotels to have a beautiful experience for snorkeling. Again very very disappointing. 5. Staring staff while you swim. While we are swimming in the sea the passing staff members would not respect privacy of guests. Some staff kept looking again and again which made us feel uncomfortable. 6. The island is one hour after Male. ONLY On the island. The phone is adapted to Male timing but on the island it is one hour later. Very confusing. Apparently they said that this will make us feel that the day is longer. In reality it made us feel it is shorter. Cause instead of waking us at 6 for the yoga class at 7 we have to wake up at 5 am. Similarly breakfast ends in reality at 930 but on the island it is 1030. Some of the positives1. The housekeeping was excellent. The team followed up on requests that they did not understand and they cleaned up the room properly. 2. The food at the restaurant is fantastic. Amazing quality of food at all restaurants. Very impressive. On the second day of our trip one of the managers of the hotel approached us and offered to give us an upgrade for our current room as we had complained to a few staff about our room the beach and facilities. We checked the room before shifting there and it did not provide a big difference to our current room except it had access to a better beach less rocky but because it was a few villas away from our current villa then we decided not to change and stick to our villa. I would have appreciated this gesture more if it was offered on the first day after our first complaint. But having an offer to upgrade to another average room on day 2 left us indifferent. In summary if you will be paying money to come to the Maldives I suggest that you do not come to this hotel as it does not provide value for money. It is expensive probably for the brand name the facilities definitely does not live up to the expectations once you have tried all the other beautiful properties and hotels in the Maldives. There is a lot that this property has to learn from other properties in the Maldives in terms of customer service to start off with. They lack the basic knowledge of making guests feel special and acknowledging their happy moments. Very indifferent not personalized service which again left us feeling disappointed. I rated it poor cause this is not a five star hotel in Maldivian standard. I will return to the Maldives again and again but make sure that I never go back to this property.", "offset": [4116, 4305], "date": "2017-04-22", "cpt": "0", "category": "facility"}, {"id": 6, "uid": "55ce2be8-154b-4017-950f-614b1054f2b1", "sentence": "Genuine Kindness. The words that comes to me in regards to this hotel are genuine kindness. I have been to 4 different hotels in the Maldives but the four seasons blew me away. Mostly because of the staff.

Today is our last day in the resort before we head back home. There is much new here 1. The resort facilities have really evolved. The resort is bigger but that is not enough by itself the marine conservation program has flourished. We found the reef here better than the reef in FS Landa. There are 3 nice pools here one for adults only and another for children. Our daughter loved the kids pool. Our daughter also loved the the Kids Club an amazing service for families. 2. The food simply amazing. We thoroughly enjoyed Barabaru and Cafe Hura. Although we are vegetarians Kandu Grille seemed amazing as well. The wine selection is heavenly. Sunset bar is amazing for relaxing in the evening with a great list of cocktails and wines3. Housekeeping and in bungalow dining is phenomenal. They really pay attention to the details. 4. Marine Discovery Center Recreation and Dive center really pay attention to your needs and can customize the experience to your needs.

My husband and I have had a most fabulous holiday at Four Seasons Maldives at Kuda Hura during the past Easter break. We stayed at a sunrise water villa with private pol1. We were pampered from the moment we arrived at Male airport we were greeted right at the exit from the restricted area by courteous staff and a comfortable waiting lounge2. After a short speedboat ride we arrived at the beautiful resort and were escorted to our villa by a gentleman introducing all we should know in our villa and the resort. There was no hassle of checking in at all. A nice surprise awaited us in our villa apart from the comfortable and elegantly designed villa a vacuum flask with hot congee and various condiments laid on the desk. It was a most heartwarming late dinner for us after a long flight3. The villa is the best among the accommodation we have had so far in our numerous trips. Everything was well designed spacious room comfortable bed excellent bathroom with LOcitane toiletries big private pool facing the beautiful water over the coral reefs nice and well furnished sunbath balcony with netted areas to view the sharks stingrays and coral fish swimming by. We were also delighted by the beautiful and fragrant flora all around the resort reflecting thoughtful and professional gardening. Strolling on the wooden walkways over the beautiful waters watching different kinds of fish swimming by was also among our favourite pastime there4. Activities in the resort were abundant and all very well organised. Among the wide variety of activities offered we joined the sunrise yoga sunrise kayaking snorkeling to look for sea turtles sharks and coral fish dolphin cruise turtle feeding and monitoring sunset shark and fish feeding crab racing spa. We were kept well informed of all the activities by the daily schedules. Even the resort shop was a good place to hang out with its nice and abundant collections and friendly staff. The gym and kids club were also well equipped and managed by welcoming staff. No one would feel bored or left out in the resort5. All staff were courteous helpful and friendly. We just felt at home everywhere we went met by smiles and greetings by everyone at the reception recreation centre resort shop jetty and on our way around the resort. We need to make a particular mention of the staff at the Marine Discovery Centre especially Joel for their informative talks as well as professional guidance and support in the snorkeling and dolphin excursions. At the spa Angelica demonstrated her understanding of customers need and ensured service at top rate. Another nice surprise was the management reception at the sunset lounge with senior management of the resort mingling with guests over complimentary cocktails and cultural dances. The best of all to me was a bed nicely made with flowers and birthday greetings on my birthday. I also received a thoughtful gift6. We had excellent dining experience at all the restaurants cafes. Breakfast at Cafe Kandu was sumptuous offering a wide variety of choices including many healthy options too. We had light and yet fulfilling lunches at Reef Club and Cafe Kandu. Our dinners were memorable sunset beach buffet at Reef Club refreshing and tasty Indian dishes at Barabaru and best of all top class seafood and dessert at Kandu Grill. Our special hearty thanks go to the staff at Kandu Grill who reserved a special pavilion for us and prepared a most yummy cake with a special sparkling candle and a birthday song to celebrate my birthday.

We just left the Maldives after 5 nights at Four seasons Kuda Hura. To sum up in a paragraph we were simply blown away by the beauty and cleanliness of the island both physically and environmentally the beautiful fish swimming around just 20fet from the lovely beach and the staff their friendliness everyone remembering our names their efforts to make us feel welcome and the sense that they genuinely wanted to welcome us back. The weather I guess the level of enjoyment in Maldives is very affected by weather \u2013 first day we arrived it was rainy and windy and I was recovering from flu and felt quite cold around the plunge pool and beach. We were fortunate to have quite a few hours of sun each day from the next day onwards and it really transformed the level of enjoyment. I guess very few would go to the Maldives with the intention of staying indoors. Although you can still swim in cloud and rain as water temperatures were comfortable visibility and the general outlook is not as good as when the sun is shining. The room. As the room we initially checked into was on the windy side of the island nb. winds can also switch depending on season. the hotel kindly gave us a choice of alternative rooms subject to availability and we chose to stay on the sunrise side on the beach and on the currently less windy side of the cove. The room was a very generous size and elegantly furnished with an outside area including plunge pool sun loungers a day bed nespreso machine a bose sound system very large TV which we never watched but good if its raining and you fancy staying in. The bathroom was lovely with indoor outdoor showers and a big bath tub. The Food was always beautifully presented and tasty there are 4 restaurants so enough choice for most we think. We tried the Indian restaurant caf\u00e9 Hura and the Grill. My wife loved the Kung Pao chicken at caf\u00e9 Hura. We were very touched by the way the restaurant staff especially Alito looked after us. The beaches sea had lovely white sand but also in some places quite a lot of crushed broken coral. Where there was a lot of broken coral it was a bit sharp underfoot and you \u2019d ideally need footwear to walk. The recent rise in water temperature about 3 years back has resulted in coral bleaching and quite a bit of dead coral. The hotel has a marine centre and they are trying to cultivate the coral and certainly parts of the reef have been regenerated and it was a pleasure to snorkel around the hotel \u2013 water was crystal clear on calmer days and quite clear on less calmer days and there was a big variety of colourful fish swimming peacefully around us. One of the diving instructors told me there \u2019s lots more to see if you are keen on diving going further out. There are loads of activities going on both complimentary and paid aside from lazing around on the beach we did a lot of snorkeling \u2013 the hotel provides snorkeling kit and I joined the daily complimentary yoga classes. Anna the Yoga instructor is first class better than any other instructor at hotels I \u2019ve stayed at. I always join Yoga sessions when on holiday and feel better for it but Anna provided a really good comentary explanation during class and she would take the trouble to correct my positions if I was n\u2019t doing them quite right. There is a long list of staff to thank and sadly ca n\u2019t remember everyone \u2019s names but special thanks to Alito Joseph Men and the team at Caf\u00e9 Hura who really looked after us every day. Naube our housekeeper who made sure the room was spotless well stocked with towels and other amenities and beautifully decorated while celebrating our 25th anniversary and my wife \u2019s birthday. Anna the Yoga instructor who taught me a lot in a few days. Hisham and Sim at the shop and. Aditya who made sure everyone else was looking after us. The Maldives is a special place \u2013 it \u2019s environment today is how many parts of the world were once upon a time \u2013 the people are warm and friendly they seem to care about and understand the impact of humans on the natural environment the water is crystal clear the air is clean and you can see the stars in the sky sadly rarely visible in many cities now. The Four Seasons are doing their bit to protect the environment \u2013 very little plastic being used and a general consciousness about waste. The only downside. It is really expensive but if you can afford it worth visiting at least once in a lifetime to experience the beauty of the sea.", "offset": [3478, 3670], "date": "2018-05-16", "cpt": "1", "category": "facility"}, {"id": 12, "uid": "9f11d4f9-d55f-4d6c-a008-dfc97bb8c260", "sentence": "Paradise island.

Santosh assistant director of housekeeping arrived immediately when I called 1 PM regarding some harmless millipedes in our bungalow cleaned everything and changed our bedding. When a few continued to arrive the following day he had us moved to an available upgraded suite. I can not praise him enough for the genuine concern he showed and the actions he took to make our stay sublime. Thank you SantoshAmong our favorite experiences were feeding the turtles kayaking in the drizzle working out in the well equipped gym and walking on the over water boardwalk to the newly purchased undeveloped small island. The meals snorkeling and overall ambiance are unmatched elsewhere.

This will be a long review so if you want the executive summary just do it. Do n\u2019t look at any other place in the Maldives just book this. Ok. so now to the detailed review. There is n\u2019t anything this place has n\u2019t thought of so I \u2019l try and cover off via my personal story of my stay. Arrival. Don\u2019t let the name \u201c Male international airport \u201d fool you. It \u2019s hot and basic. But it \u2019s all good Four seasons has you covered you can wait in the comfort of their private a c waiting room stocked with cold refreshments and snacks but do n\u2019t get too comfortable the boat is being prepared and you \u2019l be whisked away shortly. The boat ride is very quick aprox 15 mins. You \u2019re welcomed on arrival and provided the most refreshing welcome drink ever it actually needs to be on their mocktail listWhilst waiting in reception I happened to wander into a section to the left which was full of tanks with turtles of all ages. Confronted by a larger turtle Moxa clearly desperate to get out of its confined pool. I had an instant crisis of conscious how can I stay in a place that feels this sort of confinement is aceptableAle came out and I quickly asked her the purpose of this set up. it \u2019s a turtle rehabilitation center. Crisis averted. I then spent a good 30 mins learning about all the current patients and the great work they do. Incl satellite tracking of one turtle which was recently released currently swimming in the waters off Sri Lanka. Ale can I get an update on Moxa pleaseThe acomodationI was fortunate enough to experience both the over the water villas and beach bungalows. Both are exceptional my preference was actually the beach bungalow. Being over the water is an amazing experience however it can get a bit noisy at night if the tide is coming in. And if you do n\u2019t sleep well and have a vivid imagination as I do one may find themselves getting up in the middle of the night to check the villa has nt started floating away. The accommodation is exceptional everything has been covered. You have accidentally got sunburnt. no worries fresh Aloe Vera is provided in the room. You forgot your adapter. no worries all the wall sockets are set up to accept any international plug. Fresh water complimentary and not a plastic bottle in sight. All refilled glass bottles truly enviro conscious. You want to listen to your music whilst outside on your verandah. no problem the Bose portable system connects to your Bluetoth. The beaches. Both the sunrise and sunset side of the island provide picture perfect turquoise clear blue waters. The beach chairs are super comfortable. And the staff at the beach somehow know when you have arrived and will be delivering iced water and a refreshing cold towel before you \u2019ve set up your beach chair. It would be remiss of me to not point out a couple of critical points. 1. Take note of the strong current signs. They are not there for decoration. I m an Aussie who has been in the water from an early age I am a strong swimmer and beach aware. And I got caught badly. Due to pride I swam across it to get out of it but by the time I dragged myself out onto the beach I was exhausted. 2. Black tip reef sharks are alive and well and likely to be swimming past you. These sharks are actually harmless. But nonetheless it can be quite discombobulating to be swimming snorkeling and have a shark casually swim past you. And do n\u2019t think you need to be out deep these guys come into the shallows. Oh and if you \u2019re phone happens to run out of battery whilst you \u2019re on the beach which could very easily happen given I was never without WiFi service on any part of the island indeed one of the party I was traveling with binged watched an entire season on Netflix from the comfort of her beach lounge no worries each sun umbrella stand comes equipped with an international power socket. Food barsBreakfast is fabulous and if you have dietary restrictions they will bend over backwards to accommodate. There are a number of restaurant choices I tried them all and they are all great. My favorite was the grill. Fresh seafood cooked Maldivian style. The Grouper grilled is the bestThe sunset lounge is true to its name. Comfortable lounges chairs great music fabulous cocktails and the sunsets are magic. Every evening they hold a hermit crab race which sounds kitsch but it \u2019s quite funit is pretty the prices are in USD and are ex taxes etc. and if you are on AUD like I am then it makes for an extremely expensive experience. But in my opinion its worth saving up for and splurging. GymThe gym is very well equipped and the cardio equipment is depressingly newer than the equipment in my home gymServiceI\u2019ve saved the best for last. the personal service is one of the best I have experienced. Everyone somehow knows who you are and they anticipate your every need. In my view the service is what sets this property apart not withstanding everything else I \u2019ve describedAl the workers from the buggy drivers to the Gardeners greet you as you are walking throughout the property. It can get exhaustingEnding this review with some special calouts. And I know I \u2019m going to miss some people and for that I apologize in advanceFirstly. a special shout out to Maximilian for rescuing a damsel in distress for organizing my return visit so promptly and for not laughing at me as I regaled my woeful tale but rather nodding empathetically with true concernTo all the restaurant staff special shout out to Joseph Kiki Sharef Ashfan Sebestian and of course Ali breakfast was n\u2019t the same on the last morning your day off. Thank you for looking after me. Harsha thanks for encouraging me to take the flippers would n\u2019t have got out of that current without them. Nazer for letting us burrow some gear from the surf shop. Koki your gift shop is one of the best resort gift shops really unique stock and I love love my sandalsDina at reception thanks for your warm welcome and farewell x2 and especially for my welcome drink when I leftI will treasure my Kuda Hura memories forever.

We recently stayed at the Four Seasons Kuda Hura for a week to celebrate my wifes special birthday and take in some time in the Maldives for a beach holiday. I have gone into a fair amount of detail in this review as a Maldives holiday is a big decision. But for quicker reading the summary below helps. If you are looking for a beach holiday that surpasses your expectations in every way then the Four Seasons is the perfect way to do it. It goes way beyond the luxury of the property itself every person goes out of their way to ensure you are having the time of your life. every minute of every day. We arrived as guests and left as a part of the family. Beyond the physical amenities and the incredible gastronomy of this resort what makes it truly special is the staff. Without exception everyone we encountered went way beyond our exepctations of a top class resort. it is very clear that this is something they pay attention to and everyone is personally accountable for making that magic happen. We had several opportunities to observe the team at work and what stood out was how that management team remained visible and active whether it is helping with daily duties no matter how menial or interacting with guests during each meal and during the day. If there is one thing that sets this resort head and shoulders above the rest it would be this. This is not our first stay at a Four Seasons property but it is by a large margin our best Four Seasons experience to date. ArivalWhile the airport itself is nothing to write home about the Four Seasons experience begins once you are through customs. We were escorted to a Four Seasons lounge and could relax while our luggage was transferred to a speedboat. The transfer to the resort then takes about 35 minutes whereafter you are welcomed to the resort by the management team. Villa style AcomodationWe stayed in two different villas the sunrise water villa and the sunrise garden villa. Both rooms are incredibly luxurious and I think it is a personal preference as to which view is preferable. The sunrise villas are identical to the sunset equivalents but on the opposite side of the island. Our rationale was that the best way to enjoy sunset is with a cocktail in hand meaning we would be watching it from the Sunset Lounge. we are happy with our decisionWe enjoyed having the 2 different rooms. Unles you are certain of your preferences opting for a few days in each is a good idea. Just remember that you are then packing up your hotel room mid way through your stay but the luggage transfer process happens seamlesly behind the scenes. Villas are spacious and sumptious. Each had a super king bed generously sized TV which you should never need Bose sound system complimentary Nespreso and tea making facilities and walk in closets. The bathrooms are amazing double basins supersized bath as well as indoor outdoor showers. The private pool is indulgent and lovely. The outdoor area around the villa has at a minimum sun loungers a day bed under a gazebo and a general area to enjoy the sun. Rooms are serviced twice a day as can be expected in a property of this category. But what I appreciated most was the attention to detail. Normally evening turndown focuses on just that the bed and a pair of slippers. At Kuda Hura I noticed how outside towels were refreshed clothes were neatly folded and one evening my book received a Four Seasons bookmark too. Pools and public areasKuda Hura is located on a fairly small island which means everything is in easy walking distance. Grounds are immaculately maintained. In addition to the private pools at each villa there are 2 main pools one of which is for adults only. The all access pool has a swim up bar perfect for when the need cocktail now impulse kicks in. Sun loungers are available around both pools and on all beaches. These areas are serviced which was welcome. And every few hours someone does a tour of duty with a smoothie or ice lolly of the day. The final daylight hours are best enjoyed from the Sunset Lounge near the lobby great cocktails with an amazing view. Alternatively the Reef Club bar is an outstanding alternative. The cocktail menu is limited but the team will make absoutely anything you prefer or will get creative when you ask them to. WiFi is offered throughout the resort including on our boats to and from the airport. Unles you pay extra it is adequate for email and messaging but not really video calling. RestaurantsThere are 4 restaurants on the property. All are excellent. Some nights offer a fixed menu while other nights are a la carte. I had recommend you spend a little time planning your evening dining when you arrive and make sure you try to get the right blend you are looking for. Breakfast is a lavish affair with a wide variety of global options. We enjoyed venturing beyond the full English into some of the oriental options on offer. You can expect to see a full selection in continental buffet cheeses cold meats fruits etc. The pastries offered each morning are out of this world expect to find several varieties of croissants danishes muffins doughnuts and other goodies. Eggs waffles and pancakes are cooked to order. A highlight for us was the juicing station also freshly prepared. Lunch is available at 2 restaurants. Alongside the adults only pool is Reef Club which offers Italian cuisine. You can expect fresh pizza pasta salads fish and the like. Portions are generous so consider having a starter and mains to share. The calamari is a winner. Alongside the larger pool is Cafe Hura where the breakfast area is set for lunch. Expect to see more international options on the menu. The highlight included fresh fish of the day and the lobster crab pasta. Presentation is superb and food is excellent. For dinner one is spoilt for choice. And every option is excellent. The Kandu Grill is an upmarket grill expect to see red meat fish and shellfish. The Reef Club transforms into an upscale Italian bistro overlooking the pool. Barabaru offers some of the best Indian food around. Finally Cafe Hura offers a more international menu complemented again by fish and shellfish. I had suggest you try them all you can not make a wrong choice. Every night were were overwhelmed by the selection. In particular the fresh seafood bought from local fishermen is moutwatering. In all restaurants for all meals presentation is world class. Portions are generous by European standards but it is worth indulging in at least 2 courses. Your waistline might not thank you but your tastebuds most certainly will. The wine list is generous and the selection by the glass will not disappoint. In addition the team can make any cocktail you choose. For the birthday evening we decided on the private BQ for our 2nd night at the resort. If you are looking to indulge this is the perfect choice. The team had created a private dining area on the beach and we had a dedicated chef and server for the evening. As for the food. some of the best sushi I have ever had made from locally sourced fish followed by shellfish fish and tenderloin. Dessert was equally impressive. Hint. if you opt for the BQ make sure you arrive hungryFitnes RecreationThe 24h fitness facility is generously appointed with weights and a good selection of cardio equipment. Sunrise yoga is lovely. Being an island there is a great selection of complimentary and paid for watersport activities. There is a lovely area on the sunrise side of the island for snorkeling which was always teeming with wildlife. We used the kayaks on the sunset side and were fortunate to see quite a few stingrays in the shallow water. The excursion to the western side of the athol to take in the turtles is well worth the time. Whatever your preference there will private or group activites to suit. Being in the Maldives it is essential to take in something to observe the marine life and the Four Seasons provides amazing options. Taking some time out when you arrive to plan any activities is well worth it as not all activities are available every day. SpaThe island spa for which the resort is renowned was being renovated while we were there. Temporarily the Four Seasons team had built Garden Spa which occupied a few of the garden villas. We thoroughly enjoyed their signature massage but opted to spend most of our time on the beach or around the pool. Environmental PolicyI was pleasantly surprised to see the steps being taken to reduce environmental impact. In particular bottled water still and sparkling is made on site in reusable bottles. Also shower gel and shampoo do not make use of plastics. The Four Seasons also plays host to one of 4 turtle rehabilitation centers in the Maldives. They run education programmes for kids and adults and have a team dedicated to protecting this important species. Finally the hotel supports a coral regeneration programme. it is not news that that the Maldives has suffered from the impact of coral bleaching. This tragedy is also evident during snorkeling. But the positive impact of the programme is also visible. We enjoyed spending time with the team to hear about their programmes and it is clear they appreciate the support of the hotel too. Special MentionsFinaly the resort hosts a behind the scenes tour. If you are interested in seeing how the magic happens this is well worth the 90 minute investment. I found the scale of operations astounding. Clearly the resort does not have city conveniences and yet still have to provide a first world experience. And that takes a lot of work. I was able to observe the staff dining facilities the engineering facilities including power generation and water desalination and finally the food storage preparation and kitchen areas. Clearly providing a world class dining experience where you require military style logistics is quite an endeavour. And it has to be matched with a team that can prepare everything on site. And that includes a bakery that operates 21 hours a day. And FinalyAs mentioned above the stand out is the entire team and how well they work together. To experience it as a guest is very special indeed. There are a few folk that stand out to us in ensuring that our experience for 1 week was truly a slice of heaven on earth. These are Razaq in the Recreation team Amito in the restaurant Danu the resident cocktail magician the servers Mohamed Das and Rajendra Branka Maximilien Giovani and Joseph. Aflah and Tamil deserve special mention too for ensuring our BQ evening was so incredible. And these are just the names we could remember but should not be viewed as a slight on those we do not immediately recall.", "offset": [4021, 4138], "date": "2019-11-24", "cpt": "1", "category": "facility"}, {"id": 19, "uid": "3c45d31f-741e-4ac0-85b9-1624a7f0116a", "sentence": "Exceptional. it was an absolute bliss.
