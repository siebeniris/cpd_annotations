By the time he bothered to check us in there were 4 other couples waiting in line including a bride and groom. We complained to management the next morning and they were willing to give us a free stay the next time we were in town.

Since we had a 5 am flight out of PDX and live over an hour away from PDX we wanted to stay overnight and have very little effort getting to the airport the next morning. This Sheraton has existed for many years and we were not sure how nice it was but our needs were simple as long as we could get to the airport at 4am. Check in was a simple task and I was very happy to learn that I could leave our car at the hotel for up to 10 days at no additional charge. This is significant given the very high cost of parking at PDX airport and the fact that the parking garages fill up quickly. We wanted to get some food in the hotel so we went down to the hotel restaurant. The front bar area was very full of loud men cheering on some sporting event while quaffing beers. The exuberant host of the restaurant who reminded me of a cross between Jim Carey and Chris Tucker never seen this before and it almost felt like we were on an episode of some MTV reality show led us to a booth in the back the the restaurant which was empty except for two very sullen young men at separate tables eating alone. One with a hodie over his head and earbuds providing audio entertainment the other just hunched over his food looking unhapyThe menu was standard hotel and the prices were very high which may be required given the proximity to the airport. Our server a young man who was pleasant and professional gave us a bit of sanity to an otherwise surreal experience. Most hotel restaurants are terrible with poor food and high prices but I was pleasantly surprised by the food we received at this hotel restaurant. Food was hot and freshly prepared even visually appealing. Our server explained that the two young men were candidates for a local military training program on the other side of the airport so they sleep and eat at the hotel. I suddenly felt sorry for them and wondered if they were homesick. The next morning at 330am we came downstairs to check out and take the 340am bus to the terminal. Buses run at the top of the hour and then every 20 minutes after that. The man behind the desk was somewhat disheveled and seemed confused as he was apparently checking in a guest taking so much longer than I had expect at that early time that I was planning to simply leave my keys on the counter and get on the bus. Very strange I was not sure what was going on.

My BF and I came here for the weekend for a job interview I love the Sheraton and it was lovely however there were a couple things that made the experience less than seamles first we paid the daily 30 for Club Access after being told there was breakfast from 7 830 am and happy hour from 530 70 pm. We came down for breakfast at 820 one morning and they had already cleaned up and then we came down for happy hour another day at 530 and it was not set up yet. As people who run on a tight schedule this was disappointing because we expected there to be food and drink during the times defined. So we felt we did not get what we expected with that. it seems like if those are the hours defined the food drink should be available during them and the setup takedown should happen outside of those times. Next the hot tub was not hot when we got in it so a staff member helped us but it would take an hour to get it hot so that was weird to get in a cold hot tubLastly the phone in our room did not work so when i tried to call my boyfriend from the front desk or tried to make calls from the room it did not work. So we had to go to the front desk if we needed anything and when we did they were always very busy and it was hard to get their attention.
