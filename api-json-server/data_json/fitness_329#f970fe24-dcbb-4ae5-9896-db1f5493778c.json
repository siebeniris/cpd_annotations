I stayed at Harahs for a work conference and was somewhat disappointed. The location is alright fairly easy to get to. it is almost straight shot from the AC and Phily airports. Its a casino obviously. So be prepared to walk through the casino to get to check in. I got a little lost but the staff pointed me in the right direction to check in. The staff was probably the best thing about the hotel. All the staff I interacted with were wonderful. For some reason I was put in the handicap hearing impaired room. the room was nice and large clean. But being a handicap room I can speak to what you can expect in regular room. Unfortunately for me the hearing impaired system was not working properly. So all night long the lights would start flashing. After many calls to the front desk a maintenance guy came and just unplugged everything. But it was a night of sleep lost. I will make sure from now one to ask for a regular room. The biggest disappointment was the pool situation. We are charged a 20 a day amenities fees primarily for the pool and gym. When I tried to go down to the pool I was told that it was The Pool and I had to pay to go in. When I asked about the amenities fee I was told that was for the other pool which was closed. The gym was decent. It overlooked the pool I could go in. The conference hall is large. Plenty of rooms to accommodate whatever setup you need. The AV staff were on point. The only downside was how things the walls and floor were. The meeting on the floor below us was having a rager. The music was so loud that the floor was shaking and our audio equipment picked up the sound.
