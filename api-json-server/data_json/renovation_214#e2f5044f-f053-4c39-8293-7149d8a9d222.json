Nevis has limited breakfast options one day we did Cafe De Artes in Charlestown and another we did Montpelier resort but it is an effort to get to the other limited options on the island. Now the great the service was exceptional. We have a Four Seasons employee Marva check on us each day and knew our kids names. the beach cabana if you can rent one as there are only four was amazing. Perfectly located between the beach and pool. the food overall was very good and room service was also very good try the giant cookie and sea salt ice cream and make your own ice cream cookie sandwich the grounds are beautiful. Take the golf cart monkey tour. The setting is mesmerizing with a volcano over one shoulder and the Caribbean water over the other we did not mind at all the volcano brownish sand as that is part of the island the Four Seasons has done a terrific job making sure the hotel is Nevisian in ambiance and seting Pineys beach and close proximity to the beach bars is a huge plus kids loved the water trampoline in the water.

The remainder of the time you have to eat breakfast lunch and dinner at the outdoor cabana restaurant which has mediocre food at best. 1 of the 3 pools is closed the adult only pool. over 12 of the beach is torn up due to doing rebuilding for hurricane preparation. During the weekdays dump drunks and other loud machinery is on the beach so even when you are sitting on the open side it is loud and not peaceful. They are also repairing the resort dock so additional drilling adding to the noise. The golf course has brown fairways and not well maintained. The spa while lovely is extremely noisy as well. the halls carry noise and it contains the only bathroom in the sports complex area. So while trying to enjoy a massage children of all ages were running up and down the hallways screaming and playing. Obviously this distracts from what was meant to be a peaceful relaxing experience. I recommend that the hotel add a bathroom in the gym or other location in the sports area and keep children under the age of 16 out of the spa. Additionally I found the state of the resort open to not be even close to typical Four Seasons Caliber. Our room was dirty upon arrival and had to be re cleaned. There are dirty common bathrooms with fixtures toilet paper holders pictures falling off the walls. I almost cut my hand on the multiple missing tiles on the pool edge.

Valarie and her Captain and first mate were incredibly humble and patient and very much looked out for us while we dove. Valarie is incredibly knowledgeable about the sea life as she is a marine biologist. We did 2 2 tank dives with them on two different days and if time had permitted we would of done another day of diving. We saw sting ray lobsters octopus sharks lion fish and beautiful coral life. However the best thing we did was the Four Seasons Dive and Dine program. DIVE AND DINEThis was a very expensive splurge for us but it was our favorite all time activity. If you have the time and finances and are thinking about doing this do not think too long just do it. We had a quick lesson on the boat as to how to catch both lobsters and lion fish and then off we went. We battled 6 lobsters and came away with 2. It was such a rush to try and hunt and lasso these lobsters. And then the lion fish are like a virus in the Caribbean sea so we were able to catch those as well. The chef came along with us and after our first dive he filleted a lion fish right there on the boat and made a ceviche for us which was amazing. And then off for another dive to find our second lobster. Came back to the hotel cleaned up and met the chef on the beach in our private cabana where he grilled us up a three course meal.

We vacationed at the FS Nevis last March this review has been a long time coming. It was our 3rd family vacation there the 1st since the rooms main house had been renovated. The rooms had been somewhat dated so the renovation was much needed it was tastefully done. The rooms are now updated to be bright airy yet with an island motif. I understand that the pools area was going to be renovated this past fall can not speak to that project. The location remains incomparable. There is nothing like looking up down the beach not seeing any other hotels or high rises. Living in a big city I love the idea of going to a resort where you really feel like you are away unlike the feeling one gets in other crowded overdeveloped locations. The resort itself is low density no building higher than 2 floors. so you do not feel crowded at all. Also the grounds remain impeccably maintained manicured. Golf was great too including the occasional monkey sitings. The staff at the clubhouse was wonderful it is always a pleasure chatting with Mac Ke who runs the golf center is a font of info. history about the resort. The entire staff goes out of its way to make you feel welcome attend to guests needs. Many address you by name throughout your stay. The concierge front desk staff are all top draw. I had like to give special thanks to the staff particularly Chef Andrew Atangan who continually went out of his way to address the needs of my family which was particularly important since 2 in my family require gluten free dining 1 has some special medical needs. Andrew assisted us even before we arrived as we had several most helpful email exchanges. He even remembered my son from a prior visit pre arranged gluten free pizza for him. Andrew went above beyond the call of duty we are grateful to him. Andrew rocksA few thoughts about the dining itself. The breakfast buffet is excellent though there was more variety pre renovation the pool or beachside lunch options are very good. One suggestion I had like to make is to improve upon the number of dinner options so guests will not be so inclined to go out off resort which in of itself is not so great aside from the experience of a visit or 2 to Sunshines. Esquilinas at the resort is excellent a new upgrade but I had like to see another choice or 2 besides Mangos.

A recently renovated resort on the fairly unspoilt and off the beaten path island of Nevis. We visited over the Festive season and although the renovations were well done there were some serious service issues which cast a black cloud over our stay and would deter us from recommending the hotel or visiting again. The experience was inconsistent the service often beyond rude and dismissive. NOT the Four Seasons experience. So getting to Nevis is an adventure once we landed in St Kits we took a boat to the island. It was a choppy day so we did n\u2019t actually arrive at the Four Seasons pier and were dropped off nearby and ferried by bus to the resort. Once we arrived at the resort it was a bit chaotic. people were shouting our names they were preping drinks for us and dancers were getting ready nearby and then burst into song and dance. It was clear they were not prepared for our arrival. We were then escorted to the room by a friendly lady however there was no explanation of the room resort facilities activities no map no itinerary. A poor check in experience. The resort has several cottages which house rooms and suites which face either Nevis Peak or the Ocean. We were staying in an Ocean view room which overlooked the pool and then the ocean. As mentioned the rooms were recently renovated. We felt very relaxed in the room with soft colours and prints it did feel appropriate for the Caribbean. The bed was exceptional as Four Seasons beds always are. Sadly I think they skipped renovating the bathrooms. A huge annoyance with the room was the TV it skipped every 3 seconds and was unwatchable. On top of that not all channels were available. We called multiple times to get this fixed but it was never done. There were a myriad of service failures at the hotel and these happened every single day. Here are just a few examples Staff could be rude and dismissive. Our friends passed by staff in the lobby and when I followed I heard the staff sigh and say \u2018 Americans \u2019. When we ordered breakfast they would take one persons order then just walk off. Servers would not smile or say you \u2019re welcome please or thank you. Servers push you to the side as they reach onto the table. There was little effort from the team. We asked for a ginger tea they came back and said no ginger was available you ask again voila. Ginger. We received a call from concierge saying a taxi was here but we had not ordered one she said \u2018 yeah \u2019 and hung up. At dinner one night the server gave out menu \u2019s and as she had 1 less than needed her exact words were \u2018 you share\u2019. Now I will say there were some great people at the resort Marva at the pool Estelita At the Monkey Bar Michele who organized our NYE private dinner who were warm kind and considerate. However these were the exception and we believe this was their personal character. Housekeeping was exceptional. The hotel should replace restaurant staff and front of house staff with the housekeeping team. The renovation of the resort was lovely. The beach was good. although not white sands pretty the 3 pools were impressive and the lobby was beautifully done. The hotel had a spa which had not yet been renovated but had some lovely outdoor features such as 2 pools and cute gingerbread huts where massages take place. This was also a good area to spot some monkeys. The spa therapists were funny and sweet and the massages were always good. Nevis has some lovely views. However with the exception of a couple of nice restaurants I highly recommend dinner at Bananas. there is really nothing else to see on the island.

I think what makes this place truly outstanding is the people who work there. Here is an interesting story that highlights what I think makes this place so special. My husband and I are avid divers and foodies I hate that term but we are and I was immediately intrigued by the dine and dive. Basically you dive with the chef Andrew nicest chef ever. and then he cooks up your catch of lobster and lion fish. It was not inexpensive but we worked out what was included and it is more than reasonable BTW we also did the spa under the stars and that was AMAZINGback to the story we were supposed to dive our first full day there but my husband had been watching the wind and warned me it was supposed to be pretty windy which meant no diving but the staff wasted no time at all rearranging everything we had booked for our stay including the spa under the stars to try and give us the best chance to dive. The days went by each day better than the rest sunny warm but just enough Tradewinds to not dive then finally we received confirmation the night before our last day that we could dive yay. So we show up at 8 am in our dive best which is funny at the four seasons breakfast and wait and about 5 minutes later they explained it was cancelled. I was a bit disappointed but I mean safety first you simply can not dive if its too windy so I was fine. Then after breakfast the concierge called us over. They apologized profusely which again it was fine they can not control the winds and she offered us a cabana for the day complimentary and said the chef would be down shortly. We grabbed our things and headed down to the cabana where a short time later Chef Andrew came by. He again apologized again not his fault and said he would cook us a private dinner in the cabana all on the Four Seasons. Everything would be taken care of. They had watched us all week I feel like and at 5 pm the cabana had been transformed into this gorgeous romantic restaurant for two. Veuve is my favorite champagne and a bottle was waiting with an outstanding seafood tower. Then Chef Andrew came down and proceeded to make us the best meal I have ever had on the beach. Lobster Bone in Filet trufled Mac n cheese you name it. And he could not have been more welcoming and friendly. I honestly felt like they truly wanted us to have a memorable evening. My husband and I have dined all over including many Michelin star restaurants we were fortunate enough to dine at Osteria Francescana with Chef Botura this summer but this somehow felt so incredibly special. They went out of their way to make sure we had a perfect trip and we did. Thank you so much FS Nevis we will definitely be returning.
