Overall this hotel was great. The Reception staff were very helpful and professional and the rooms were spacious and clean. The bed was extremely comfortable and great sheets and pillows. Breakfast was plentiful and a good selection but waiting staff seemed to lack training and were slow in clearing which meant a queue quickly formed. It did not bother me but some guests were cross it brought down the atmosphere. We decided to try this hotel as it had a pool so it would give us an activity when we were based in the hotel. Apparently this is being improved but that is of no use to me this visit The water was freezing. so I did not go in. Sagres is windy in August we have been before so we knew this. but I think the water therefore needs to be warmer. Not enough sunbeds shades and very cramped. The grounds are good so maybe set up other lounging areas there whilst the pool is so small. We paid extra than our married children for a sea view. It was spectacular but so was their room so I am not sure I would pay for that again. Our room was just off the Reception too so quite noisy. I am sure we could have moved but were too lazy.

We were taken to our room and quickly routed ourselves to the incredible pool which was gorgeous and served generous wine pours. While staying here we LOVED the delicious breakfast and complimentary workout classes. We enjoyed an outdoor pilates class with Monica who was super friendly and gave us a good vacation workout with incredible views.

This design and boutique hotel is located at the end of the main road of Sagres just next to the port. It welcomes you with beautiful architecture upscale modern classy and understated in a great way. The lobby area library embodies the style of the hotel perfectly. Staff is outstanding friendly helpful smiling. They will gladly assist you with any question you have or assistance you may require booking spa treatments or excursions etc. They also help you when you get lost in the sprawling complex which happens to pretty much everybody during their first two days. The hotel has a small but good gym for a hotel with treadmills free weights and one or two machines. Breakfast is superb the large buffet selection is presented in a room on the ground floor that allows you to look into the park around the property. Talking about the park While the hotel has access to the beach it is slightly above so you can first pass through the park where the hotel has set up beach chairs to find shelter from the wind. There is also a really nice pool with pool bar. If it is too findy for you to be outside there is another pool as well as a sauna and steam room inside. The hotel restaurant is probably the best place to dine in town excellent service. If you want some more variety there are plenty of options in Sagres the hotel will be able to recommend good ones. Parking at the hotel is free. Decent and reasonably priced spa services. Downside is the Internet service the signal does not cover all rooms sufficiently.
