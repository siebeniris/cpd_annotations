Top notch location and well deserved 8 rating out of ten. The rooms are small but very functional and dare i say it cool.

You select your choice by completing the forms available on the table which are then collected by the fabulous and friendly lady who runs the serving. While waiting there is a great choice of things at the semi buffet. Breakfast here truly sets you up for a day around Singapore. One of the very best things about the Wanderlust Hotel is the Handy mobile phone which you can borrow from the room. You get free calls and Internet for the duration of your stay and is great for taking out and about.

In the event it has become the slightly cheapest SPG hotel in Singapore I paid S190 a night vs the Sheratons S20 at least until July when the refurbished Four Points opens its doors so it got my three night reservation thereby also getting me a free additional night at any SPG Category 5 hotel could be worth US 200 or moreThe hotel is a small boutique hotel down a side street walking distance from the new Rocher MRT. Location is bit out of the way but it enabled me to explore some of Singapore I have never been to before and eat some good cheap Indian food for lunch. Check in at 1 pm two hours early was quick at the small reception by very pleasant receptionists and I saw my reservation had been made through an agency called Valhalla rather an anything that identified Starwod. No mention of SPG or indeed any Platinum benefits which was to be expected. SPGcom had n\u2019t given me any choice but I \u2019d booked a Mono room apparently the corridor is black and the room is white. Otherwise the room appeared a bit featureless and bare for a design hotel. Second floor rooms are designed like capsules but pictures of the top floor rooms look the best. The Mono room is kind of like an Aloft in function. Small sink in the bedroom shower and toilet in an attached wet room. I had been allocated the wheelchair room opposite the lift I am pitch perfect on the lifts ping now. The wet room design meant the shower went all over the toilet seat. A lot of amenities in the room. Toothbrushes vanity kit shower gel and shampoo safe Nespreso machine with four capsules four types of tea including camomile a selection of ten free soft drinks in a fridge whose door opened the wrong way which would make it challenging for a wheelchair user to get at including yes Coke Zero so happy about that. Also an Android phone to create WiFi hot spots out and about that was labelled only for customers who book direct I have my own cheap Android phone for this purpose a five day 10Gb tourist sim in Singapore only costs S15. Super comfy double bed. A card apologised for the noise outside the room that was beyond their control but was helpfully accompanied by two sets of ear plugs. In the event the offending street restaurant plastic chairs and tables line the pavement was serving all night but it was n\u2019t raucous and did not keep me awake. There are no full service hotel amenities here like a gym club room swimming pool or business centre but there is a small sun deck with jacuzi that I sat in one afternoon and it was sunny and peaceful during the day. Housekeeping was very friendly but the wifi felt slow and a speed test revealed about 1Mbps connection which is not much for Singapore. I had good feelings after I checked in but this dissipated by the first night. The room heavily promotes its French restaurant Cocotte in the lobby but I am afraid my experiences there were very disappointing. First I fancied a beer late afternoon in the lobby bar but was told it was closed between lunch and dinner times. I understand the kitchen being closed but the hotel bar in a lobby that is clearly designed to hang out in. I do not understand that. Then that evening I decided to try the five course menu with accompanying wines. It was 830pm and there was a large company meal in full swing so I asked if I could take one of the high tables in the empty bar nicer for a single diner anyway. Apparently not because it was booked by the private function even though they were all in the restaurant and the bar area was deserted. So I was sat near the kitchen in the restaurant. Although it was hardly late and the private function was having a great time I felt that I was being rushed through the meal with the second course arriving before I had finished the first. Also the waiter explained very abruptly that the accompanying wine portions were tasting sizes without me having reacted to the size of the pour at all. The French inspired food was good especially the duck. but I did not enjoy the steak which was quite flavourless yet fatty. Good fries though. My feeling of being rushed was confirmed when the bill arrived while I was still eating at 1010pm even though the private function was still clearly on going. What really annoyed me though was that I could not charge the meal to my room bill. The waiter flatly refused. So why I wondered had they blocked my credit card when I checked in for more than the room rate. there is little else to spend money on here. By now I was irritated by the whole experience and sincerely wished I had eaten elsewhere. I had tried to win the waiter over by smiling and being super polite throughout but as I stood up to leave I was totally ignored while he laid the table next to me for breakfast without a thanks or a see you again. And consequently they did not get my S25 for breakfast each morningIncidentaly turn right out of the hotel walk 25 m and you will find an excellent restaurant called Roots that has a good and good value dinner set for S50 nett. Friendly service and very good food. I enjoyed my evening meal there so much I returned for brunch the next dayBoking through SPGcom meant I got points qualifying nights and the special offer additional free night at a Starwod Category 5 hotel of my choice. Otherwise I would have felt a bit upset about the price paid vs the value compared to the Sheraton. And the fact you can not charge food and drink to your room means you do not get points for this spend either which further devalues the place the meal should have got me 500 Starpoints. I know that some people will say that this is a totally different type of hotel and I should not compare but for 10 more I had have got breakfast a club lounge evening drinks and food a pool gym and points for all my spend at the Sheraton. Even without the Sheraton comparison at S190 in this backpacker area for a limited service hotel it felt over priced. Again not a direct comparison but the Hotel 81 Dickson across the road which has exactly the same facilities ie no pool gym bar in the afternoon etc. is less than half the price of the Wanderlust. I also got the feeling that the hotel views SPGcom as simply another Agoda or Bokingcom. that is not a complaint as I had no elevated expectations of Platinum recognition but it would not make me book another Design Hotel in the future if there was an adequate Starwod hotel nearby. In the end if it had not been for the complete disconnect between the hotel and the lobby bar restaurant I would have been happy if not delighted with my stay here mainly because of the friendly reception staff rather than it being good value or the Mono room being a fun and stylishly designed place to sleep. But the service and policies in the bar restaurant did succeed in annoying me which is a real feat because I am quite benign. So what would have been a happy Good stay for the price if it cost S150 160 it could score Very Good. loses a point to become Poor.", "offset": [5050, 5277], "date": "2016-04-25", "cpt": "0", "category": "restaurant"}, {"id": 10, "uid": "40fb6e08-ce1c-4527-b8eb-4799b6776523", "sentence": "Awesome stay.

The hotel is in the hood around funky horrible mini marts and dodgy looking restaurants. The hotel itself is fine. The lobby restaurant bar is quaint and that is about it.

At 4 am the water pipes in the hallway in front of my room broke and the hallway and my room were flooded.

I asked at front desk to be moved to another room but was told the hotel was fully booked. I returned to my room where I could not sleep because the water was still dripping and there was no hot water in the shower as well. The next day it was impossible to rest since plumbers were working in front of my room making loud noises the whole area in front of my room was wet dirty and smelly. When I reported this to front desk they offered to give me a 20 discount on the first night because I only missed 4 hours of sleep they said. I found this offensive to be honest and asked for a free night and complimentary breakfast as a gesture to compensate for the lack of sleep and comfort. After being awake for 4 hours I would have really appreciated to have a complimentary breakfast to feel at home in the hotel. The front desk agent did not let me talk to the manager and refused to compensate with breakfast because the onsite restaurant is not operated by the hotel she said.

Stayed here for roughly a week. The room was a little cosy but everything was comfortable and clean. Shower had great pressure and the mattress was soft but firm. I hit a snag on the first day when I asked for a latte downstairs because they had a beautiful coffee machine behind the bar. Apparently however that machine is only a decoration and broke last year and they had tried to fix it but ended up giving up on it. They serve percolated coffee with horrible long life milk so you are better off having the chai tea with your breakfast it is a little on the sweet side but still enjoyable. Even though the coffee machine was busted our room had one of those Nespreso pod machines that made up for it. Our first day breakfast was amazing I had the eggs and avocado and was very pleased with the meal. The second day however the chefs were different so for some reason the same meal came out different and I had to ask for what was missing from the previous day. The great thing about the hotel is it is located in little India and there is a wonderful Indian food restaurant about 100 m to the right as you come out of the hotel. it is on the left hand side corner of the first intersection. If you go left past that Indian place and right at the next intersection there is a 71Al in all a comfortable stay we liked the design with all the retro barber chairs and neon lights.

The hotel is surrounded by industrial shops local food vendors markets and hawker centres. it is also just moments from Singapore \u2019s incredible MRT system which makes it the perfect base for further city exploring. The most exciting part about this hotel no two rooms are the same. During inception the hotel partnered with four award winning local design agencies Asylum Phunk Studio DP Architects and fFurious. Each agency was granted total creative freedom to transform an entire floor in the hotel. Fun fact the hotel was originally an old school built in the 1920s. On the first level of the hotel themed Industrial Glam by Asylum you will find outdated industrial pieces scattered throughout the entrance lounge wine bar and restaurant. Spotted old barber chairs dentist ceiling lights old fashioned leather sofas and even a traditional and complementary Singaporean snack cart. The second floor themed \u2018 Eccentricity \u2019 by Phunk Studio hosts a variety of rooms featuring different Pantone colours neon signs and musical inspiration. The bright and entirely yellow suite known as \u2018 Yellow Submarine \u2019 inspired by The Beatles is a guest favourite and ours too. Check out that vintage cast iron tubthere is even a rainbow corridor to explore leading to a rainbow jacuzi. The third floor themed \u2018 Is It Just Black and White \u2019. by DP Architects features nine rooms with sharp black and white contrast. Half of the rooms are inspired by the Japanese art of Origami and the other by Pop Art. On the top floor themed \u2018 Creature Comforts \u2019 by fFurious there are nine spacious duplex suites. The theme was influenced by the idea that travel experiences become much more memorable when we have met or have made a new friend. fFurious designed each room with its own friendly creature to welcome guests and to bring them comfort in a new place. These unique creatures are born from different themes a typewriter tree space ASCII table and bling. The quirky hotel has also integrated a new wine dine concept WINEDERLUST by Unlisted Collection. The wine and bistro bar has over 300 labels of wine available and creative dishes for pairing.
