The weather was not great but the hotel was excellent. The staff were helpful and friendly and there was just enough choice in the restaurant. Beautiful views from the restaurant too. The local restaurants are so good that you would probably choose to eat out on some evenings. The interior design was very pleasing lots of open space both inside and outside lots of comfortable sofas and seats to sit on in the evening having a drink or just reading a book. Attractive bedroom good bathroom all spotlessly clean. Good swimming pool although it was not heated and because the air temperature was not warm we did not use it. There is a beautiful beach just a short walk down from the hotel. No high rise hotels nearby there was in fact a lot of space in the hotel and around the hotel and Sagres itself was only a walk away although it is a very small town. A rather long bus ride will take you to Lagos from near the hotel and a much shorter one to Cap St Vincent. The hotel has only been recently re furbished and the staff are trying very hard to make it a good experience for visitors. The manager was in evidence and it would have been nice if he had acknowledged his guests he seemed totally absorbed in ironing out a few running problems particularly over Easter when the hotel was very busy.

Our arrival at the hotel was not exactly what we expected. The lady at reception was extremely unfriendly and after grimacing over us giving her our booking details I asked you for your passports nothing else informed us that we were far too early and our suite would not be ready until 3 pm it was 1030. We had just arrived in Portugal after a very early morning start with our two young children so it was a bit of a shock to the system to be greeted in such an unfriendly manner but a very lovely member of staff Luiz who actually handled baggage and was working there over the holiday period more than made up for that mean spirited receptionist. He was adorable telling us to leave our luggage behind the front desk informing us that we were free to use the pool and could have towels things she should have told us. It was a real pity that we happened upon the one member of staff that acted that way. Everyone else was very smiley and seemed lovely. In fact Luiz told us he was sure our suite would be ready a bit earlier but when I went back at 240 20 mins before our designated check in time without even checking with anyone the same charmer told me no it is not ready and went back to her seat. Despite that rather sour upsetting start we really fell in love with Memo. We had a family suite which was a tad shabby but perfectly adequate and had the most stunning views of the sea and harbour. There was admittedly a disgusting stench in the hallway undoubtedly because of a problem with the drainage system but this was forgivable in light of the unbeatable location of our suite. The doors were difficult to open and close but what a reward lay outside. And the sunrise. Light streaming through every morning. The pool area was also beautiful with beanbags scattered around and a brand new very inviting bar. Breakfast time was a bit of a zoo with a large number of guests in a very small space but the food was delicious and somehow the hordes of people did not really bother us and Laura who was in charge of seating was charming. In fact most of the serving staff were a treat. The food in the hotel restaurant was also very good although I would have preferred a few more seafood dishes but this was a minor quibble.

We have evaluated every eye move for the staff and we had nice memories. Because we had halfboard we followed the rules to eat in the undergorund level restaurant. Celia is doing herself the service here as a great worker with passion ethics and devotion. Unfortunately she has accumulated 20 years of job stress and she is reflecting sadness deep from her soul. She deserves more than a simple holiday one sabatic year payed by the company. When I was in the same situation I quit my hospitality business after 20 years. I am sorry to say that HB atmosphere in this saloon was like in a Claustro we had eating not just the food but also human feelings air sounds and motion. We are coming from a poor european country all my year savings have gone in this summer trip. I am apologizing to Celia but she has to rebuilt her charm soul and continuous smile or to work in team with Luis Ismael or the other lady which coordinates the upper saloon to create an equilibrum. The food at HB had garnishes only potatoes in the first 3 days a bit poor for us coming from a potato land. I have asked an appointment with the Manager and he offered me the chance to be more happy for HB inviting us in the upper restaurant with a bit larger menu. The stay for 7 nights was with happy end here we have contributed to that with a rented car to rich easy the location or the beach. I am sure the staff can accomplish all the expectations for all nations and for all demanding tourists as me. I have worked with ratings from my guests and always was great to receive high percentage because gave me a reason to continue. Probably a single opinion from Romania is not significant if will be badly low. For Tripadvisor I will rate high this hotel at 100.
