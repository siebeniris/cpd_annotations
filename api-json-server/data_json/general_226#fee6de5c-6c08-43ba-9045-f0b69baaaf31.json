The bed was comfortable and the air conditioner worked REALLY well. The bathroom had decent space and the shower had good water pressure. The desk which looks like it used to cover the air conditioner because of the vents at the back was large but it was turned against the same wall as the wall mounted flat panel TV.

I stayed at this property in May 2017 one night on a business trip. It had high points and low points. The GOOD. Nice new building large clean rooms free airport shuttle bar food on premises. The BAD. 1The bed itself was old sagy uncomfortable. The bedding sheets duvet etc was high end but this was a clearly old and sagy mattress to the point where my back hurt in the morning. It is puzzling that a Sheraton brand at this high of a price point would allow this bed in a room room 28. if that maters2. Service at the front desk was very disappointing. At check in I noticed my corp travel agent booked the room at the full rack rate well over two hundred per night. I asked for the AAA rate and handed my AAA card to the check in guy. He punched some computer keys handed my card back and said you are all set. It is my mistake that I did not ask to initial a documented room rate at that point. At checkout I showed the bill slid under my door still at the full rack rate to the desk agent and asked her to correct it to reflect the AAA rate. She advised that it was already closed and that I should call accounting after 9AM. I called them that day left a detailed voicemail including my AAA number and my phone and email asking for a corrected receipt. Nothing. I called again this Monday same thing. Nothing no response whatsoever. Conclusion. this property has good potential but at this high of a price point I would not stay here again nor recommend it to business travelers.

OMG. Arrived at 130PM on a Sunday. This hotel is in the middle of nowhere off an exit on a major highway near the airport. Anyway about 7 cars in the parking lot. Go up to the check in counter and the woman simply says Check in is 30. I was dumbfounded. She did not say oh we are at capacity and the rooms are still being preped cleaned. Simply no you can not check in because it is not 30. The place is a ghost town. So I said OK we will go and find some place to have lunch. Well there IS NO PLACE to have lunch unles you want to eat at a Subway. So after driving around and finding nothing we went back to the hotelit is now 20 and a shuttle van from the airport had pulled up and about 4 men were on the line to check in. My husband and I sat down and then watched as each man was handed a key to their individual rooms. We were like WHAT. So I got in line and the woman did not say anything to me but I gave her that look and she gave me my key. If she had not I think I would have given her what for. Anyway we went to a concert that evening and arrived back around 100am. We needed a 50am wake up call to catch our flight. Well the phone in the room did not work. So I went downstairs and they tried calling the room. The phone did ring but when my husband picked up it was dead. So I asked them if THEY could possible put in the wake up call request for me and the woman different from the afternoon said yesThey also said they would try to find a working phone for us. I went back up to the room then returned to the lobby a short while later. They could not find a replacement phone and the woman sheepishly explained to another co worker a guy that she did not know how to put in a wakeup call request for us. So if I had not gone back down we would have never gotten the call.
