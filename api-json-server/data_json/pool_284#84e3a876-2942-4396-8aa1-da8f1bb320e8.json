Stayed in Memo August 2014. Absolutely stunning hotel to look at. Situation on cliffs excellent. Beautiful views from the pool area. The pool was icy cold in August. Freezing. I could not go in at all. There is an indoor pool but they have a weird policy that you have to book a half hour slot in it and then you have it to yourself. I only got it once in the 5 days I was there. Not getting in the outdoor pool did take away a significant aspect of my holiday but that is what you get for being in such an amazing location basically on the corner of Portugal on the Atlantic Ocean. The rooms are excellent. Everything you could need good fridge very small balcony. Very quiet. This is not really a place where people bring children so it has a really chilled out vibe. Mostly couples. Everything is white. The bar at the pool serves fantastic juices. Though pricy. Sagres is tiny. One street really a very short walk from the hotel with lots of little restaurants. You can not get a bad meal in Portugal and all very reasonable. Lots of gorgeous chilled out bars. Very surfy beachy look and relaxed vibe. No one gets dressed up really. Few if any shops. Had trouble getting any souviners it is just not that sort of place at all. In conclusion if you want absolute relaxtion in the least commercialised built up resort in The Algarve and you do not mind the longest transfer from the airport then this is the place for you. By the way do not try to walk to the lighthouse for sunset it is at least a 90 minute walk not 45 as the guy in reception told us and of course it is pitch dark coming home.", "offset": [167, 199], "date": "2015-08-01", "cpt": "0", "category": "pool"}, {"id": 3, "uid": "479abbce-2ec3-421c-9885-b89096f786e2", "sentence": "Good concept execution not so good. We were two couples staying at Memo in Sagres. The design and the location are very nice. The quality of the food at breakfast was also a plus. The breakfast room is way too small for this hotel sometimes you had to wait more than 15minutes to get a table for breakfast. Families with more than 4 people might have to wait even longer. The same goes for the pool area there are not enough sunbeds or umbrellas for a hotel this size. The Staff was either very friendly or not at all Joao at the pool bar was definitely a sunshine compared to some of the Staff in the Pizzeria at the hotel. We also looked at the dinner buffet they offer in the breakfast room and we did not want to eat there it is 25 euros and you have very little to choose from less than at breakfast. Sagres however has great restaurants all in walking distance. When asking for reservations at restaurants the front desk was not very helpful it really depends on the person you talk too.

It did not bother me but some guests were cross it brought down the atmosphere. We decided to try this hotel as it had a pool so it would give us an activity when we were based in the hotel. Apparently this is being improved but that is of no use to me this visit The water was freezing. so I did not go in. Sagres is windy in August we have been before so we knew this. but I think the water therefore needs to be warmer. Not enough sunbeds shades and very cramped. The grounds are good so maybe set up other lounging areas there whilst the pool is so small. We paid extra than our married children for a sea view. It was spectacular but so was their room so I am not sure I would pay for that again. Our room was just off the Reception too so quite noisy. I am sure we could have moved but were too lazy.

Our arrival at the hotel was not exactly what we expected. The lady at reception was extremely unfriendly and after grimacing over us giving her our booking details I asked you for your passports nothing else informed us that we were far too early and our suite would not be ready until 3 pm it was 1030. We had just arrived in Portugal after a very early morning start with our two young children so it was a bit of a shock to the system to be greeted in such an unfriendly manner but a very lovely member of staff Luiz who actually handled baggage and was working there over the holiday period more than made up for that mean spirited receptionist. He was adorable telling us to leave our luggage behind the front desk informing us that we were free to use the pool and could have towels things she should have told us. It was a real pity that we happened upon the one member of staff that acted that way. Everyone else was very smiley and seemed lovely. In fact Luiz told us he was sure our suite would be ready a bit earlier but when I went back at 240 20 mins before our designated check in time without even checking with anyone the same charmer told me no it is not ready and went back to her seat. Despite that rather sour upsetting start we really fell in love with Memo. We had a family suite which was a tad shabby but perfectly adequate and had the most stunning views of the sea and harbour. There was admittedly a disgusting stench in the hallway undoubtedly because of a problem with the drainage system but this was forgivable in light of the unbeatable location of our suite. The doors were difficult to open and close but what a reward lay outside. And the sunrise. Light streaming through every morning. The pool area was also beautiful with beanbags scattered around and a brand new very inviting bar. Breakfast time was a bit of a zoo with a large number of guests in a very small space but the food was delicious and somehow the hordes of people did not really bother us and Laura who was in charge of seating was charming. In fact most of the serving staff were a treat. The food in the hotel restaurant was also very good although I would have preferred a few more seafood dishes but this was a minor quibble. Overall we fell in love with windy Sagres and its broken down dirty harbour. There was something very appealing about Memo the location. Hard to top.

We raised it several times with reception and the on duty manager was never available and he she made no attempt to seek us out to discuss. The indoor spa pool had out of service notices on both massage jets and tiling on the pool floor was badly missing it is in need of a good repair. We are keen swimmers and the reason we chose this hotel was the attraction of the heated outdoor pool. Also while we were relaxing in the public lounge area it is not ideal for senior staff to carry out a review with one of the trainee staff for 30 minutes.
