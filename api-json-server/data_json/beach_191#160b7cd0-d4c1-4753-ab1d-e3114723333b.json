On the whole island they have the best location. especially is you love sailing. We started off at the Dreams Sugar Bay and it was not what we were hoping for. We decided to leave without even staying a night and went to the Ritz. So glad we did. It was amazing. The building is gorgeous the renovated rooms were spacious and beautifully designed and the setting is perfect. Many resorts on the island have to content with the very rocky and hilly geography requiring guest to go down about 5 floors before reaching the beach. The Ritz is gently sloped down to a gorgeous beach on a bay. Rental of the Sunfish catamaran snorkeling gear paddle boards etc are all included with your resort fee. The bay is perfect for sailing with lots of wind and the coral reefs right by the hotel are great for snorkeling. We saw a lot of interesting fish. The restaurants are great too. We went to several restaurants at other resorts and the Ritz has the best location by far.

I have never stayed at a Ritz Carlton before. but after my recent stay I do not know if I will ever be able to vacation anywhere else again. The thing that stands out the most is how helpful and friendly the entire staff was. From the moment we arrived till the moment we left the incredible staff made us feel like the only guests in the entire hotel they addressed us by name went out of their way to make sure all of our needs were met and did whatever they could to exceed our expectations. The concierge service at the resort is fantastic and they helped us book several dinners including a private dinner on the beach and an extremely relaxing couples massage in a beach cabana. The food drinks and service at all of the restaurants were fantastic and the spa treatment was incredibleOur room was the perfect size with a nice big bathroom and spa like shower.

Went to this resort as a result of an incentive work trip. My wife and I usually stay at all inclusive resorts given the choice so we were not sure about how expensive this place would be. it is expensive. Now I am sure that is just fine with most people planning a stay at a Ritz Carlton. But what this place cost did not deliver what we expected. First impression We were too young to be there. I am in my early 30s and it seemed the average age there was 60. Nothing wrong with that just not usually the type of place I had choose to vacation. Example We spent most of our time with another couple who traveled with us. we are not loud obnoxious late night partiers but someone called security on us twice in one night while we were hanging out on our 1st floor patio. at 10 pm. Even the person sent to quiet us down said we were not being loud but he had to do his job and ask us to go inside due to a complaint. Awesome way to spend a vacation quiet and indoors at 10pm. Rooms. Nice enough rooms expected more luxury for the Ritz. Our room was on the 1st floor with a patio facing the water. Although The patio next to us was separated by a 3 12 foot wall. Not much privacy there but it was ok since we knew the people next to us. Overall the rooms were nothing special. Room service for drinks was fairly quick though. Pool Beach did not spend much time at the pool opting for the small beach area instead. The view from the beach was absolutely incredible. The best part about the resort by far. Service on the beach was excellent as well. Food Since we were there for a work incentive trip most of our meals were at work events. can not comment much on the restaurants except for the place we ate breakfast every morning. I had say good not great but that had be generous considering it costs around 60 couple. I really hate to complain. really. Read my other reviews. Maybe it is because I expected more. Maybe they really do rely on their name to express luxury without actually delivering on it. Overall I have to go back to the expense. We were there for just 4 nights. Our rooms were paid for most of our meals were paid for through work events and half the time our drinks were too. However between two couples we managed to still rack up a 160 bill. Most of that was the 15 frozen drinks and 7 beers. we have stayed at more than one all inclusive that was nicer more luxurious with better amenities included better food and better service for the same price it costs just to pay for the room at The Ritz Carlton.

We changed hotels at the 11th hour due to an issue with another property and could not have been more pleased with the Ritz. We were welcomed with open arms chilly fruit punch and a view of the ocean. Manager Katie Brady was such a sweetheart and was kind enough to send us a bottle of champaign to welcome us and start our vacation off right. We were in the Begonia building on the 3rd floor and had sweeping views of the water and beautiful property. Water toys like snorkel gear sea kayaks etc. We ate at Sails for lunch and it was yummy and had dinner at the Italian place on site which was also very tasty. This location is 10 minutes from Red Hook cabs are 6 bucks a person to go over for lunch dinner or drinks.

I will start off by saying that my family and I are premium travelers and often stay at Banyan Tree Rosewood Four Seasons and Ritz. We also have young kids both 7 and under and we often look to marry first class resorts with fun activities offerings for the whole family. We alway stay in 1 bedroom suites on the we will always book club level when we travel. Ok all that being said here is what you get at the Ritz Carlton St Thomas and in St Thomas as a whole. I will base my comparison here against the Ritz Grand Cayman GC as other have done so in their reviews. The HotelI would classify the Ritz St Thomas as one of those classic style sleepy caribbean joints. The hotel itself is welcoming and not imposing large. The layout feels more like a small college campus with multiple low rise buildings making up the hotel side. From the main building the bellman will take you by golf cart to the building you are staying in. A quick note on the main building and this is directed to the mgmt of the hotel you can do so much more with this space. I would recommend a hotel bar or a large lounge area. Right now the configuration is quite confusing. Great views but it could be used in a much better way. Ok back to the review the exterior of the hotel is not one that you would step back from and admire the beauty of. Again it is kind of classic chic. All hallways are exposed to the outdoors which leaves them open to the elements causes them to show wear and tear. My room a 1 bedroom suite club level was very nicely laid out. I would venture to guess that these rooms are probably the nicest on the island but still not Ritz Grand Cayman nice. If you are a hotel snob you will notice that little things that will cause you to reflect that this is not a 5 star property and you would be correct but again that is the point of this review. I hope to give you an honest look at what you get when you book your vacation to stay at this property. So a quick summary my room was very nice but had some dated furniture and minor wear and tear issues. Bed was fine. Bathrooms were great. Balcony was great and quite large and overlooked beautiful Great Bay. The hotel frames the bay beautifully. It is the stuff of postcards. The Bay it is a BAY not a BEACHAgain in keeping with the theme of this review. know what you are signing up for you are getting a bay. it is very rocky and grassy. There is a small stretch of sand for beach chairs but it not a beach where you can take long walks. There are three beach cabanas in total and should be avoided as the cost 400 per day and are not necessary at this property. The bay is a gem to look at. Very beautiful. There is a reef just off the shoreline which makes for very fun snorkeling in kid friendly depths. They also offer multiple non motorized watercraft for you and your family. SUP Wind Surfing Kayaks etc. All very fun and a run by a very friendly staff. The pool is nice but not large. there is also a small kids splash pool but it is very very small. The bay offers pros and cons. Pros. no waves very shallow great for snorkeling and easy to lean SUP as again there are no waves great for kite surfing wind surfing and plenty of room for kayaking. Cons very rocky once you wade in will hurt your little ones feet without water shoes marshy bottom grass and plants washing up on beach. Again this is just to let you know what you are buying when booking. Some will love it. others will find it not what they want in a caribbean vacation as they might want a lush white sand expansive beach. All depends on what you are looking for. This is why comparing this property with Grand Cayman is almost not fair as they are not the same at all. only commonality is the name Ritz Carlton. They are two totally different types of experiences. DiningDo not come to this property for a culinary feat. Rests are just fine. Menus are limited. Service is not white glove. Again just so you know what you get. In summary dinning in not why you choose to come here. Note. we ate at all resturaunts on property. The best option is to book club level rooms and eat all meals in the club lounge. In summary We enjoyed our time here 1 week. We did as much research as we could have before we came. I did not find a review like mine on TA. Do not rent a car as taxis are abundant and there is not much on the island that you would want to drive to. Shopping downtown is similar to all other cruise ports and is not a major reason to leave the hotel. Trips to St John via fast ferry and other surrounding islands make for a nice day trip. I hope this review helps other travelers.", "offset": [2207, 2244], "date": "2016-08-25", "cpt": "0", "category": "beach"}, {"id": 7, "uid": "51346b42-924b-48d6-aa78-03a503eb3987", "sentence": "Beautiful clean friendly staff expensive food. Business group awards trip with 5 couples. Check in was a little slow as lots of people arrived at the same time. We were escorted to the check in desks and offered some leaded or unleaded rum punch or lemon water. We were also handed chilled lemongrass infused wash clothes. It was nice to wipe away the travel muck and stress. Our check in assistant gave us a map of the property and arranged for a golf cart ride to our room. The room was spacious and clean with a mix of real wood furniture and newer laminate pieces. There was a bowl of fruit waiting along with a lovely gift of a scented candle inside a sea shell. There is a refrigerator but no mini bar. A Nespreso with coffee or tea was sitting next to the television. The patio is very spacious and had two chairs one small table and one lounge chair. The sconce lights on either side of the patio doors are for show only and do not light up. Plenty of hangars for two people two robes ironing board and iron umbrella safe and a bottle of bug spray was inside two door closet. The safe was large enough to easily store our two 10 tablets SLR camera Itouches phones wallets and other misc valuables. We walked around the property to locate restaurants etc. Plenty of signs pointed you in general directions. There are a lot of stairs to climb so if you have mobility issues this may not be the best resort for your needs. We could not decide on a restaurant and had not made reservations so we went back to our room and ordered In Room dining. Two pasta entrees one salad one appetizer and one beer totaled 14260. The food was hot and tasted delicious. Portion sizes were appropriate. Because there are so many stairs that separate rooms your dinner is brought to you in a picnic basket. Our delivery person set up our table on the patio and we ate by the light of a very bright full moon. The bathroom was large and clean. Two vessel sinks large tub on one side walk in shower on the other. Water closet with telephone for. ok I do not believe you should ever be on the phone when you sit on the toilet but maybe that is something other travelers do. To each his own. Toiletries included two sets of shampoo and conditioner. Three sets of body wash and two bars of soap. Two mouthwash one hair comb one emery board two shower caps three bags of q tips three bags of flat cotton pads two packaged toothbrushes one travel size toothpaste and even a box with a 3 blade razor and shave cream. Four setting hair dryer with retractable cord. Two sided lighted mirror. As we were there in January there was not a lot of people around. The one day that we had spent around the pool area there was plenty of lounge chairs available. Although as mentioned in someone elses review all the chairs and lounges are slammed together pretty tightly. I did not investigate very thoroughly but I only saw one private cabana. Our inquiry into getting a cabana for the day the price was 400. We visited Zest a couple of times and they do make a delicious smoothie. They also have a small selection of snacks cookies and crackers if you want something to nibble on in your room. There was about 8 small tables outside Zest if you wanted to sip your breakfast slowly. Turn down service was done while we were away but they did leave breakfast menu for in room chocolates and replenished our supply of water bottles. Our breakfast order of fruit plate eggs and bacon breakfast sandwich juice and milk ran 9220. We choose delivery window of between 90 915. Delivery was at 901. Anytime we passed a Ritz employee whether it was valet housekeepers grounds crew bellmen managers wait staff or security every single one greeted us with a friendly hello how is your stay have a great day. If it is policy then everyone is well trained. If it is a reflection of the people that you have working there you hit the jackpot. Plenty of iguanas were around most within the area of the salt pond. Watch for sea urchins in the water. Internet access was easy and speed seemed fine. We have Verizon cell service with 1 G coverage on most of the island. Our group did take the Lady Lynsey to St John for dinner. It was an incredible trip and I will provide review separately. Check out was seamless and we hated to leave this beautiful property.

We had a wonderful stay at the Ritz in St Thomas. We were greeted with rum punch and a cool cloth. Check in was a breeze our room was ready early and we were taken to our room by the friendly bell hop on a golf cart. We stayed in a normal ocean view room not club level. There are about 6 buildings all running west of the lobby that forms a sort of horse shoe all with ocean views. There are also buildings east of the main lobby that house the condos. Our room was in the first building west of lobby closest to the main lobby. The main lobby building sits up higher than the other buildings. The concierge desk and some shops are located here. It \u2019s a beautiful building with steps leading down to the pool. The view from the concierge desk is beautiful. We used the concierge desk several times and they were very helpful with any questions concerning excursions reservations where to eat etc. Our room was very easy to get to. The bathroom is quite large double vanity with a tub large glass shower and separate toilet room. We had a king bed and they brought a small rolaway bed in for our 14 year old daughter. Not sure if an adult would want to sleep on a rolaway but she slept fine. Our bed was a little lumpy but we were so tired that we slept great. The room was adequate not very big but big enough. Balcony looked out over the grounds and to the ocean. We had a small fridge big enough for milk orange juice water and some soda but no microwave. We had a Nespreso machine that was wonderful. I normally drink my Keurig coffee everyday and was pleasantly surprised at how good the espresso coffee was. We were supplied with plenty of water bottles everyday. Room service was very good they also had turn down service every evening also. Our room was clean and nice. Service was excellent. Every time we saw a worker they smiled and greeted us. Grounds were absolutely beautiful. The pool is decent size but not that big. It has infinity edge with plenty of lounges around. It felt a little crowded at times I think another pool would be helpful. The pool attendants will find a seat for you and set you up with towels and water. No need to put towels down early they will remove them if you leave for a while which I LOVE. They brought out cookies in the afternoon as well as fruit kababs. Bar service around the pool was okay. Sails restaurant bar is right there so we just went and got our own drinks. The ocean is right past the pool. There is a small stretch of beach it \u2019s kind of rocky with a ton of chairs. Not the best for swimming but there were plenty of people in the water. The setting and views are just breathtaking. The water is beautiful going from light to dark blue very clear with views of St John and St James. It \u2019s heavenly. The water is very calm so it \u2019s perfect for paddle boarding. The Ritz has paddle boarding snorkeling kayaking and Hobi Cats available to take out at no extra fee. You have to know how to handle the Hobi Cat in order to take it out. The resort gave my husband a refresher course 45. so he could take our family out. We loved that sailed all around the bay. The water is so clear you could see all the way down. There are sea turtles and marine life all around. They have very good snorkeling at the rocks just west of the beach or near the rocks just east of the beach. Food can be pretty expensive at the Ritz. We went to Moe \u2019s Market in Red Hook 5 minute drive and got breakfast stuff and some snacks so we did n\u2019t have to eat out all the time. There are a few restaurants on site and they are expensive but very good. Sails restaurant is open for lunch every day and dinner a couple times a week. It is wonderful. We did not go to Bleuwater breakfast buffet is 36. but we did have pizza at Esenza which was wonderful. Service at Esenza was excellent. We had drinks there most evening and the bartender Jack was very friendly. They have the best chips. They hav a little caf\u00e9 called Zest which sells breakfast sandwiches and ice cream. There is not much going on at the Ritz in the evening Esenza is the only bar open if Sails is closed. Red Hook is just a short taxi ride away and has plenty of restaurants bars to choose from. If you want the amenities of a resort with a pool restaurants beach activities great service then the Ritz is definitely the place to stay if staying on St Thomas.", "offset": [2433, 2466], "date": "2017-08-18", "cpt": "0", "category": "beach"}, {"id": 9, "uid": "5fe48cb3-a655-4fbf-9410-7230da6caa93", "sentence": "Would n\u2019t stay there again.

I really do not like giving average or negative reviews especially in this case because the staff is super kind. I just feel like the hotel needs to be aware of some things. First of all we had a very welcoming greeting when we arrived. We were brought drinks immediately upon our arrival while we checked in. After check in they gave us an additional. It was a sweet gesture to start our stay off right. During check in we were told that we would be given a 200 resort credit per night because the hotel still is not completely finished. This was a great surprise and a very kind gesture. We were in Puerto Rico staying at the St Regis over Christmas before we came here. it is hard to not compare the two. We read TripAdvisor reviews on this hotel and our expectations were not very high so being told we would be credited was a very nice surprise. We arrived at our room and while it was okay it was not anything fancy. Much smaller than the room we stayed in at the St Regis. Beds were comfortable and we had a deck which was nice. Although the Ocean View room we had was more of a view of the construction of the pool. We did not spend time out there since it was mainly construction. As for the shower in the bathroom it seems odd that it is frosted glass that you can see into the main room. So you can see someone showering or at least the shadow of them. There was also light from the shower so if others are still sleeping in your room its not dark. Being a Ritz I would have expected better. The first night we ate at Coconut Cove. Nakita was our server and she was very friendly. My husband ordered a seafood pasta with Lobster mussels clams and shrimp. My daughter and I had the chicken pasta. The chicken pasta was absolutely delicious both my daughter and I loved it. As for the seafood pasta there was no lobster and barely any mussels or clams. It was mainly shrimp. When my husband questioned it the manager asked the chef and he said he was out of lobster. That is fine but they should have told us that because it was 14 more for the lobster. They offered to take it off our bill but my husband said no it was still good and since he ate it he suggested to just charge him like it was a chicken pasta which they did. I am only pointing this out because of what happens a few days later which I will talk about below. The guys and gals working the pool were super friendly and helped get your chairs set up. Christmas is a busy time but we never had issues finding chairs. There were plenty. Lunch at the pool took over an hour to receive which seemed like a long time so just order before you are too hungry. Most restaurants require reservations before you arrive because when we got there they were all booked for dinners. The breakfast buffet restaurant near the pool was good although you could tell the wait staff were extremely stressed and overwhelmed. The second day we ate here there was quite a wait. We told them we would be waiting outside and they said they would come out and let us know when our table was ready. As we saw people behind us in line getting seated my daughter went up and questioned and the lady was not very kind and said we have been calling your name for awhile. My daughter quickly reminded her that we told her we were waiting outside since there was no room to wait inside and that she agreed to come out to tell us when our table was ready. They sat us next. New Years Eve lunch we decided to eat at Coconut Cove again because we wanted the chicken pasta. Nakita was our waitress again and we were happy to see her. My husband ordered a bacon cheeseburger. She asked what kind of cheese and he said swiss. She came by our table shortly later and my husband questioned if saw that it said bacon on the cheeseburger. She said he was accurate and there would be bacon. So out comes his cheeseburger and my husband jokingly said this is the orangest swiss I have ever seen. Nakita felt bad and said she would take it back and fix it immediately. My husband told her no it is not a big deal he likes cheddar too. She leaves and my husband realizes there is no bacon. So when she comes back he tells her and you can tell she is completely embarrassed. She brings the bacon. My husband then started eating the burger and after a few bites he realizes there is something in his burger. Sure enough it was the wax paper that divides the cheese. He calls Nakita over and she looked mortified. She asked to put it on a plate to show the chef. My husband was done eating at this point. When our bill was brought to us we thought for sure they would take his meal off especially since my husband did not have them take off the pasta off the first night like they asked. We thought it was only fair since he had wax paper in his burger that he be comped that. So he scratched off that part of the bill and did a new total. When we received our final bill we saw that they did make the adjustment on their end which was good however it should have never been on the bill in the first place. That night we went out to eat in town. When we came home there was a bottle of champagne and a very kind note from Nakita. That was great customer service and they definitely tried to right their wrong. We were thankful for that even though we do not drink champagne. On our last morning there we had to get up early for our taxi and when I went to shower I realized the staff that serviced our rooms forgot to leave us any fresh towels. They took all of our old towels during turndown service but forgot to leave new towels so we did not even have hand towels. It was about 7 am and I called housekeeping and they never answered I called the front desk concierge and they never answered. Since we all needed to be up and showered it was quite frustrating no one answered their phones. I had to call the bell desk to ask for towels. They said they would be right up. They arrived at 830am. Luckily our flight was delayed by several hours so it was okay it took them so long for the towels to arrive. I do feel there should always be someone available answering phones for guests though. We were eaten alive by the sand flies so be sure to use the Off they have for you near the pool. My daughter stopped counting at 100 bites on her body. Red bumps welts that were super itchy. Ok back to the good. The water is beautiful there is coral and rocks in the water but we still got in and my son and husband did some snorkeling. That was fun for them. The sand is super soft and when you are not looking at the pool construction the view is stunning. I loved looking out to St John. I would return. I just hope they get some of these kinks worked out soon especially when I had to use more than the usual points for our stay for a hotel that was not quite ready. Once the family pool is completed it will be great.", "offset": [1090, 1177], "date": "2020-01-16", "cpt": "1", "category": "beach"}, {"id": 12, "uid": "f32ad2ce-4993-47b5-8a10-8d65178c5feb", "sentence": "Service not up to par for a Ritz Carlton property. We just returned from a 5 night stay at the Ritz Carlton St Thomas staying in an oceanfront queen bedroom. With Bon Voy Ambassador status and previous Ritz stays my expectations were high but tempered by recent reviews and understanding that they are still recuperating from the hurricanes. However we were extremely disappointed with the consistency of service offered. We take this special trip every other year and were extremely disappointed with our stay. From the beginning we were not able to reach anyone at the hotel via phone or email to answer questions related to the reservation. One time that I did talk to someone it took over an hour on the phone to attempt to change our room type. After leaving several messages and emails for a concierge no one ever responded. Eventually our Mariot Ambassador was able to confirm everything for us before we arrived. While the check in process was simple through the ap and the welcome lovely after several calls to the front desk we were told that we would need to pay an additional 350 night for access to the Club Lounge regardless of the lifetime status. We made several requests at the concierge desk the pool deck and over the phone to reserve a pool cabana and never received any response. Half of the time when we would call for reservations or room service no one would answer the phone at all. While lounging at the beach the service was spotty and inconsistent at best. There was an issue with the Sails kitchen which prompted a very limited menu for lunch and food being prepared next to the pool beach on grills under a tent. I was not expecting just one restaurant on property to be available for meals. Our room was on the 5th floor of building E and with only one elevator on the other side of the building I would not recommend this hotel for anyone with mobility issues. There are stairs everywhere throughout the main building to and from the pool and the beach etc. The construction of the family pool was very disruptive. It was visible from every room and the hotel attempted to disguise with music that started early each morning on the pool deck with the same playlist each day. The construction definitely cuts into the pool deck and you need to reserve your pool loungers early in the morning if you want a place to sit. At the beach you need to reserve a chair early in the morning if you want to sit in the front row. The attendants were friendly but not helpful even with tips. There just did not seem to be any focus on the customer experience at this resort. A couple of staff members were very friendly Lisa from in room dining was a delight each morning but not able to hold the rest of the resort to the same standards.", "offset": [1485, 1642], "date": "2020-01-29", "cpt": "1", "category": "beach"}, {"id": 13, "uid": "ede2f347-dfa3-441e-b304-1583f3652afe", "sentence": "Not so Luxurious Ritz Carlton. My fianc\u00e9 and I are frequent Ritz Carlton vacationers this was our first time at the St Thomas resort and sad to say it will be our last as well. After reading reviews we understood that the hotel is just starting to come back together after the huricane renovation. Upon arrival to the hotel our check in process was very strange. We were kind of brought around to different areas of the lobby until we were sat down and someone came over to help us. It seemed like staff was unsure what to do with us. We did not like that our bags were sitting in a pile of other peoples luggages outside the hotel until our room was ready. Mind you we absolutely love the Ritz located on cayman island and all their other properties. Our hotel tour guide was great in showing us around and answering general questions. The view from the resort is stunning in itself. It was pouring our first day so we were looking to browse the shops at the hotel do anything however only their jewelry store is open all the other shops are not yet ready. To my knowledge there is no arcade or really much else to do besides lounge at the pool beach activities and excursions. Calling concierge the staff was not very knowledgeable on what stores are open which surprised us. Also we were being called by the wrong last name our entire trip do not know what was up with that. We had club access where we spent a lot of our time having drinks and munching on snacks which was nice. Our first night we ate at Bleu water restaurant the atmosphere was bland decor was lacking it came across like more of a family restaurant less of a romantic feel we were trying to go for being a steakhouse. Our food took over an hour to come out. However our food was tasty. Our next day we reserved a cabana by the pool which was nice. When we got to the pool area I let staff know we have a cabana reserved and we were told oh no they are all reserved I let them know I reserved mine a week before our trip then I was led to my cabana which was not set up yet. It was 11 am they rent out from 9 am for the day. Service was just ok. The beach is not the most enjoyable due to all the coral sea grass. This is definitely not a pure white sand beach Incase that is what you are looking for. Only one pool is open right now so everyone is congested into one area. There is a slide being built which looks fun for the kids. I highly recommend taking the ferry over to trunk bay beach in St John it was the highlight of our trip. That beach is beautiful pure and memorable. Pros. Staff was very very kind. They can drive you anywhere via golf cart should you choose not to walk. I truly feel bad writing this review because staff is so so nice however they were poorly trained lacking guidance. The room was clean and newly renovated. Bathroom was extremely spacious perks for water toilet having its own door. The property was beyond beautiful and everything is just a close walk away. Cons besides everything I mentioned already bathrobe was dirty with makeup smears. Food not good. Served raw food twice on our trip. Overall we love staying at the Ritz properties we love being club level. however there are nicer Ritz caribean locations than st Thomas they still need to get their act together here a bit to say the least. Nothing to quite rave about just yet. Food options could be better. Service at coconut cove was very strange my food was raw food is not Ritz Carlton quality. Room service food quality was not good plates came dirty and food did not look pleasant to eat. A Ceasar salad at the ritz should not be salad from a bag with bagged shredded cheese soggy pieces of bread serving as croutons and bottled dressing. Our room service chicken fingers were completely raw pink. My husband got sick. The kids can get sick this way. Where is the ritz quality. This luxury hotel giant is going down hill. No longer luxurious ritz Carlton.

The location is absolutely beautiful the rooms are outstanding and the decor is luxurious. The staff is extremely helpful but I hate to say very inexperienced. The restaurants are not up to Ritz Carlton standards. The hotel is still very much under construction as the noise early in the mornings will testify. There is only 1 pool. The A C was very loud when it turned on to the point where it woke us up. There are construction vehicles everywhere and noise all day. The DJ plays the music so loud at the pool overlooking the beach trying to drown out the construction noise so it is disturbing to those trying to relax at the beach. More like a \u2018 Spring Break \u2019 atmosphere that should not be part of this gorgeous landscape. I want to say that we enjoyed the week we spent on the beach staring out into the beautiful blue water but instead of relaxing at a luxurious Ritz Carlton resort for a week at 1250 night there were only 2 restaurants open neither of which were worthy of this brand standard we spent money on taxis at night looking for local restaurants. Both of us have very busy work lives and we were looking forward to just a week of total relaxationnot taxiing around at night to find a decent meal. There is much more work to be done here at this RC. Club level is mediocre at best.

We visited this property this past week. It has just been remodeled and the property itself is beautiful. The rooms are clean and spacious and the bathrooms were very nice and roomy as well. The personnel working there were all extremely helpful and friendly. I really can not give enough compliments about the staff. The only reason I am not giving this a 5 star rating is the restaurant service. Please read this all the way through the food at the restaurants we ate at Bleuwater Aloro and Sails was all excellent. The servers themselves were all extremely nice. The issue is the kitchen production is very slow. I am from NY and I understand island time. but this was slow by all standards. My gut tells me this is just growing pains from the reopening. The back to back hurricanes really shut the island down and re opening and re training everyone is going to take some time. We already talked about coming back next February because my wife and I are willing to bet everything runs smoother. Other plusses for the resort are how close it is to the Red Hook ferry which takes you to St John. The taxi to the ferry is less than ten minutes and the actual ride on the ferry is less than 20 minutes. You could likely leave the Ritz and be sitting on the beach at Trunk Bay in St John in under an hour. The Coral World aquarium is only a 10 to 15 minute cab ride away as well. If you have kids this is a good stop and their new Dolphin experience was awesome. I understand this is a Ritz property and everyone expects five star all the time particularly given the cost but I would still stay this is a great place to visit. I guess the highest compliment I can give is that in the car back to the airport my wife and I were already talking about coming back.", "offset": [1236, 1337], "date": "2020-02-22", "cpt": "1", "category": "beach"}, {"id": 16, "uid": "aa7e211a-2099-4863-8843-434c9f537e98", "sentence": "nicely appointed 3bedrom condo and friendly staff at the Ritz Carlton Club. We stayed at the Ritz Carlton Club not hotel during school vacation week. The condo had two master suites beachside and a twin bedroom. Nice furnishings. The 3 separate balconies were designed based on the building facade instead of their usability and half walls blocked the spectacular views. During our stay the resort was not that full room wise and yet it was difficult to get reservations at the open restaurants onsite. The food prices were expensive like 20 hamburgers with fries at the two beachfront cafes. At the Aloro restaurant we sat at a counter overlooking the salad and pizza prep kitchen since we could n\u2019t get a table. It was fun to watch the food being prepared and having the staff talk about what they were making. The 22 Bianca pizza at the Aloro was delicious. Risotto al Funghi and Rigatoni were very good too. Since the 2017 hurricane not all facilities at the Ritz Carlton were available. The hotel officially opened in November 2019. With one pool closed on the hotel side it felt a little crowded at the other pools and the beaches were still being worked on. When we confirmed our reservation with the Club Concierge we received an informative email about the resort amenities restaurants events watersports grocery ordering plus dinner recommendations with links for St Thomas and St John.

The restaurants have inadequate seating are woefully over priced and the staff are poorly trained and totally incompetent. Room service screwed up our orders.

I \u2019m guessing the sailboats do n\u2019t go out very often. And last but not least the front desk could n\u2019t figure out how to send a bell man to pick up our luggage so we dragged it up the stupid hill.

The Verdict. This is a nicely remodeled Ritz with well appointed contemporary rooms though would not call them overly spacious some solid food nicely manicured grounds and a pretty infinity pool. That said this hotel has two glaring problems. First its located on a pretty underwhelming beach. If you love the sound of crashing waves the sight of crystal turquoise water and soft white sand on your feet this is not the resort for you. Pretty to look at but ultimately more of a small bay inlet. Pool lovers will likely have no problem here. Secondly the service was pretty hit or miss. We expected this given its a recently reopened resort of this size but disappointing nonetheless. Some highlights. Roms grounds and pool area. Food was solid for a beach resort we liked Aloro Staf is warm and mostly accommodating. Olivia in Guest Relations was wonderful. Arranged all of our restaurants spa transfers etc in advance personally oversaw our arrival checked in with us throughout our stay. But onto the issues Club We had a pretty unfortunate experience here. I will say it is been nicely remodeled. But as it turns out as a Titanium Bonvoy tier you actually DO NOT have access. After being warmly greeted by the staff we were enjoying a glass of wine before dinner when confronted by the Manager asking for our last name. I told her and continued on not thinking anything of it. She clearly went to cross reference and came out to the deck to loudly inform us that we in fact do not have Club access. Sure this was our mistake though Titanium typically gets this perk in the US. She then offered to call the front desk to charge our room 300 night if we would like to keep enjoying during our stay. It was really the delivery that got us upset she was not terribly rude but everyone heard around us and it was embarrassing. Its a 5Star hotel we were n\u2019t trying to sneak into the Club. She offered we could finish our drinks after telling us the hotel is not classified as a US property its in the USVI \u2026. Felt nickel and dimedPol Chairs. I think this is just given they expanded the pool area but the pool furniture should be nicer than beach chairs. They \u2019re not uncomfortable but you just do n\u2019t feel luxury when sit ing in them. AC units in rooms are loud maybe not replaced with remodel.", "offset": [458, 517], "date": "2020-03-03", "cpt": "1", "category": "beach"}]}
