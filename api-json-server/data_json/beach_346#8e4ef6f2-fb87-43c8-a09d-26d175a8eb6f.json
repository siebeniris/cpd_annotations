A little dated over priced but a good hotel. This is one of the early classic hotels of Dubai and is situated by the Burj Al Arab which ensures great and interesting views from all rooms as they all face the sea. Rooms are good and well appointed although looking a bit dated as the hotel is now about 20 years old. Pools are OK and breakfast was excellent. All drinks and restaurants you can use a wide variety in the hotel and also in the linked hotels close by are in my opinion significantly over priced and that is the opinion of someone who is used to Doha prices. When you stay there you also get free entry to Wild Wadi water park which is good as the lark is very enjoyable and entrance fees are eye watering. A family of four would not get a day in the park for less than \u00a3 250. \u00a3 10 for a small locker hireI think that to stay here you probably need to ensure you get a good deal in room rates.

We had a very enjoyable holiday at the Jumeirah Beach Hotel. Staff were lovely and very polite everywhere we went. I found our room a little dated however the view of the beach and Burj al Arab every morning was amazing. We did not have a balcony in our room but did not feel as though we missed out as it was really hot outside. Had the half board option this is what makes the stay at Jumeirah Beach Hotel amazing. We went to a different restaurant every night within the entire Jumeirah complex guests can visit the other Jumeirah hotels and had a three course meal each time. We preferred to get a buggy to the pool at the Madinat Jumeirah or Mina a Salam each day. The beach was fabulous we enjoyed walking along each evening taking so many photos of the Burj al Arab. There was plenty to offer for breakfast each morning but we found it really busy and often had to queue for a table particularly at weekends. The Dhow and Anchor was a nice place to have drinks and so was Uptown at the top the views from here are excellent. We found 360 a bit pretentious and the door staff were not very polite. It tended to be popular with visitors rather than hotel guests and not a lot of places to sit due to reserved tables. But there are so many nice places to go for a drink elsewhere in the Jumeirah.

Just back from a weeks stay. We had booked a one bedroom suite with half board. Picked up from airport in a 7 series BMW that was ready and waiting for us. Dropped us at the premium leisure club reception where we then had breakfast. Our room was not ready so they offered us an upgrade to the presidential suite. Very nice duplex at the top of the building overlooking Wild Wadi side this side of hotel is not getting upgraded as far as I am aware so request this side to get away from any possible noise. Decor in room and tiling in bathroom was a little tired but the views were amazing. Housekeeping did a good job keeping everything clean. Lots of toiletries etc. Liked all the extras like beach bag and flip flops. Nice touch. First time staying here as we usually stay around the marina but as we were taking an 8 year old with us we wanted something more family friendly. We preferred using the pools at Al Qsar and Al Nasem rather than the exec pool. did not like the main pool of JBH as it was very busy with day guests I think and very manic. A lot of the pool bars have special offers on wines which was great. 30 35 dhsWe loved being able to use the half board at night to go to the adjacent hotels. I was not so pleased to discover some of the restaurants I wanted to visit had a large supplement for half board guests. Our favourites to visit with a child were Dhow and Anchor and Perry and Blackwelders. Both have big portions. Buggies were regular except on the last Thursday this week. Had a wait during day and night. Not the best in the heat. Staff were all great especially Shamir. In club reception. The building works did not really bother us except for the temporary kids club. It was really poor. One room for all age groups and not much for them to do. This was one of the reasons we booked this hotel. We were told it would be closed after we booked and were offered Mina Salam instead. We are glad we stayed put though overall. My other half used the squash courts every day and said they were very good. The Nintendo room in the club only ever had one or two handsets connected to the TVs screens. Even then we needed to get the staff to set them up most nights. It was a bit of a shame as this room could be a real hit instead kids had to share. I would not bother with a balcony room in the summer unles you really need one as it is so hot. We took the free tour on the abra around the Madinat. it is a great way to get your bearings on the other hotels. Housekeeping left towel animals and presents most days for our child. It was my birthday the day before we arrived and they left petals etc on my bed which was nice. Overall we really enjoyed our holiday.

The Jumeirah Beach Hotel and all of your staff were outstanding and the management of the onsite construction work was excellent with very little impact being felt by guests. All the other guests I spoke to were happy that they had chosen to remain at the Jumeirah Beach Hotel despite the construction work rather than stay in alternative accommodation and this is a testament to everyone that works in your property. We dined in La Parila to celebrate our 25th Wedding Anniversary this was for a party of 12 and we had a fantastic evening. The La Parila staff were very good to us providing proseco cake and flowers to make the occasion even more memorable. I would like to advise that Diana and Alpha from the PLC reception and Roger and Sanjev from the executive pool were stand out members of staff for ourselves. Roger also presented us with proseco cake and flowers while at the pool so my husband and I felt thoroughly spoilt for our wedding anniversary. They really do showcase the Jumeirah Beach Hotel at its very best. I would additionally like to mention Riaz one of your transfer drivers for going above and beyond. My son left a bag in the PLC reception which we discovered when we got to Dubai airport and Riaz very kindly ensured this was retrieved and delivered to us at the airport in time for our flight departure.

Having heard about the hotel refurbishment that ended in October 2018 our family of 4 decided to book a one bedroom ocean suite for the February 2019 UK half term holiday. As time for our holiday approached it became clear that there was new ongoing construction work at the hotel which we were never warned about. I therefore emailed well in advance and requested a room away from the construction work. Having arrived on 16th February we were incredibly disappointed and upset to be given a room directly overlooking the construction room 452. We literally could not have been any closer to the building site and the noise of boulders being moved and drilling was deafening. In this particular suite the floor vibrated every time the drilling started which was almost 24 hours a day. I am astounded that Jumeirah actually believe they can keep this part of the hotel open and operational whilst this work is ongoing directly outside. It is not something you would expect from an internationally renowned brand such as Jumeirah. During our first night the sound was deafening so I emailed hotel manager Mariane who did then organise for us to be transferred to a different suite which had 2 bedrooms and was a bit further away and higher up room 201. Despite this the noise from the building work was still very audible at night. I simply do not understand how a brand such as Jumeirah which I had always considered to be about luxury and customer service can keep the hotel fully operational during these building works.

Day one of family anniversary trip. Arrive after midnight. No welcome. It \u2019s the night shift so family thirsty and go to bar to get drinks. Cost \u00a3 30. What happened to the jumeirah welcome drinksSent to room at 1 am. Wrong grade room. So back down to reception. Offered a room for one night then moving today. The noise from the building work was shocking. All night it is happening. Like sleeping next to a quarry. Eventually got to sleep. Woken at 8 am by a sound of what can only be described as a nematic drill in slow motion. I was here one year ago and no such noise overnight. Let \u2019s see what room they give me today. I am promised the other side of the hotel. Where it should be quieter. Let \u2019s see. Also amazingly enough when a manager came to see me in reception last night he was actually more rude than anyone I has previously spoken too. What a difference a year makes from the most fantastic welcome to a feeling of being the last arrival of the day and most likely the last of many complaints of the day. What a lovely way to start your 10th wedding anniversary. I just am feeling bad that I let my family down on a tired first night in the hotel after very little sleep. To think I dare suggested I was given last night free at the hotel and then told no and if you do n\u2019t want to stay here you can find another hotel. Wow I was actually shocked this so called manager actually said this. To be fair the next day some friendly faces I knew were very nice. Now I am on day 3 and since a room move expecting to have less noise I am really let down. I was told in writing that noisy work was restricted to 9 am 6 pm. Let me say this is not true. See my email content below. Please see below in regards to ongoing development. While the work takes place round the clock noisy activity is restricted between 9 am to 6 pm. Work is happening towards Marina beach side so it impacts the beach stretch side towards Marina beach end. So this is a lie unfortunately. The noise is all night. Ok your tired and family fall asleep. Young children do but the noise at 1230am is still too loud. If you wake up or need the loo at say 7 am be ready for the loud morning building works to start ahead of schedule. Clearly there is no guidance on timings etc. It \u2019s just the noise of giant diggers and giant stone holders being picked up and moved. Do n\u2019t get me wrong. We love this hotel. Great for families and great food. We love the pools water park and restaurants. Also Premium lounge is very useful and enjoyable. I just am going to suffer with sleep deprivation for 10 days. I wish I could be moved I guess but not to another room like this. Nothing really changed since our last move based on the above. The noise in the day is fine to be fair. You do n\u2019t notice it and absolutely fine by the pool and in evening at restaurants. But we need to sleep. I need to sleep. This hotel group is building the New hotel. This is Clearly why the hotel group do n\u2019t really care as there is no way another hotel group would be allowed by Jumeirah to do this work overnight. In my opinion and I work in hotels There are a few weeks a year that are during school holidays and the hotel knows exactly when they are. Surely during this period they should just stop building works overnight from at worst midnight til 8 am. This is such an iconic hotel in Dubai which is trying to stay open as usual. I wish I could ignore the noise but I ca n\u2019t when trying to sleep. Need to buy expensive alcohol at night to try and help me get to sleep. Even that not helping at 7 am.
