We arrived around 530 pm on a Friday afternoon. There was ample parking and the option to valet. The hotel is a beautiful structure however the decor is very Victorian. The lobby and restaurant are tastefully decorated. The hallway on the second floor was a striped wallpaper that dated the hotel. Our room was clean and just enough space. We had a nice view to the shopping center. The bathroom was quite spacious. The kids enjoyed the pool and hot tub. The pool area was comfortable. I would say we paid a little more than the value. We had the prime rib and seafood buffet for dinner. The food was delicious. Everything was cooked perfectly. They even had a sushi buffet and it was very good. I really enjoyed their cheesecake. I would say it is one of the best I have had. The dinner was perfect including the price. We did complete a breakfast order and placed it outside our door for next morning but I had to call at 1030 am because we had not received anything. When I first called the girl said they only had one order for delivery and that it was done at 8 am She asked if I wanted to place an order now and I said I would call back. At this point my kids were starving so I called back and the person on the phone was the dining manager and I explained what happened and she gladly took care of our breakfast order for no charge. It was delivered fairly quickly as well. Things happen but she gladly resolved the issue. All the employees were pleasant and friendly. We may look at other more price friendly hotels the next time but would not mind staying again.", "offset": [518, 556], "date": "2015-01-03", "cpt": "0", "category": "pool"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "879f98dd-09a7-4359-902d-b7ded4e94031", "sentence": "superb hotel great pool. My husband and I have been staying at this hotel for one two nights each December for the past six years for a conference of his. We love the spacious and comfortable rooms and bathroom. Everything is top notch quality I am impressed by the bathroom mirror each time as it has a circle right in the middle that does not fog up no matter for how long you take a shower. There is no free WIFI in the rooms which is a bummer I think it is available for free in the common areas. The rooms are quiet. We have had rooms facing towards Easton which is nicer or out back where you just see the fields that separate the hotel property from the Interstate it looked like they were starting to develop them when I was at Easton a few weeks ago so that view might change sonI love the pool. It is huge for a hotel pool and usually I have it all to myself at 8 am on those days we have stayed there. Great for swimming laps. The location is good and we always do some of our Christmas shopping at Easton after the conference. You can leave your car parked and walk to almost. everything. The breakfast buffet is pretty good with omelets made to order and seems reasonably priced at around 14 person if I remember correctly.

Our room was not ready more than 30 minutes after the stated Check in time. Angela and Ty both Front Desk staff were apologetic empathetic and gracious. We were upgraded to the Presidential Suite. The location is ideal. Once you are parked at the hotel you can walk to all the shops and restaurants at Easton. We always visit the large heated indoor swimming pool and whirlpool. We sometimes use the above average fitness center. The on site restaurant serves an inexpensive and refined breakfast buffet.

In the morning breakfast is complete and the atmosphere is great. The pool is very large with a nice hot tub. It is an italian themed pool and it is surrounded by windows bringing in a ton of light. Its the best hotel pool I have seen outside of vegas. Usually during the day we have the pool to ourselves so if you are reading this please do not come in late March I like the streak we are on. We have gone now for over 10 years and not once had anything but a great experience. One year we had a blizzard and could not get out and they gave us a free night and fed the family.

I am a grandmother who was spending the night in Columbus with my granddaughter. I looked specifically for a hotel with a pool since that is all my granddaughter wanted to do.

As hotels renovate and close certain benefits Expedia also has to change these in your criteria. I did go one day and the front desk said they would call for a transport. We sat there for a long long time near the front desk only to find out the transport came and left without being told and the front desk person on the walkie talkie was directly in front of us really I was with a child. Also since I booked through Expedia Hilton would not let me have any extras added on even though I was willing to pay cash for them like having an American Girl doll bed for my granddaughters doll.

This big hotel is wonderfully located for those who want to experience fine eating with satisfying shopping. Part of the Easton Center with shops both large and small including Macy \u2019s and Nordstrom \u2019s and levels of restaurants to choose from this hotel sits within walking distance of most of these shopping and eating emporiums. The hotel has recently been renewed in a good way. The lobby has been updated and looks brand new. Reactions to this upgrade are varied. It is clean bright and modern. The cool whiteness is welcomed in summer. In winter the whiteness reminds one of the cold outside. One positive of the redesign is a restaurant and grocery combination room. Choice is a part of the design. For traditionalists who remember the dignified quiet dining room of the \u201c before \u201d this combination room is fast and efficient but not with the gentle \u201c feel \u201d of before. The sleeping rooms are a little larger than many newer hotels of today. Especially notable is the oversized bathroom with plenty of space to lay things out. Once one experiences this largeness one feels cramped in other hotels and one realizes that genuine hospitality often takes second or third place to profit at most hotels. Not that this hospitality is cheap. Prices of rooms are well a little high but you get what you pay for. One change in this new order is paying for parking even self park. In yesteryear self parking was free. I \u2019m sure shoppers at holiday time often filled hotel parking space because of closeness to shopping areas. One significant feature of this hotel is a real swimming pool. That is it is more than a postage stamp or just a place to get wet in. For swimmers doing laps for exercise the pool is much better than most. The downside for real swimmers is that parents tend to bring children and just kind of dump them in the water. Children are tadpoles who do not realize that swimmers swim in straight lines. So there can be tension at times especially on weekends. Would our party return to this hotel.
