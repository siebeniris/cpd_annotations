One thing I can brag on is the staff without hesitation at the Mariot is the staff. While working out I had a warm bottle of water staff came and brought me a cold bottle. Friendly with good recommendations directions even a heads up about potential traffic issues. However i wavered between a 3 and a 4 rating due to issue with the room. You can tell where they have glossed over basic repairs and not taken the quality into consideration. Paint from the trim on the wallpaper obvious patches where small areas of wallpaper have been replaced made the room feel older and cheaper than it probably was. The bed was way too firm. I am used to that in hotels but it was almost too hard to sleep at night. I was given a connecting room and I am not sure if all of the rooms were like this but I got to hear my neighbors phone conversations half of the night. In addition several room numbers were missing looked torn from the wall so it was interesting to make sure I made it to the right room the first time in. The soap shampoo etc was too strong of a scent for myself and a few of my coworkers. Obviously these are complimentary and I had my own supplies for the trip but it would be nice to have a second option for those of us with sensitive noses. I think if they approached maintenance and upkeep with the same drive they approach customer service it would make it a top place to stay in the city.", "offset": [404, 505], "date": "2015-05-17", "cpt": "0", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "6ae86599-4151-4bb7-9e90-de27f8922875", "sentence": "Great staff rooms could use updating. We stayed here for three nights while attending a conference. The hotel is a very convenient location both the interstate and to shops and restaurants that are walking distance. While the room had all the conveniences you had want and expect in a Mariot so no complaints it definitely could use some updating. I had to get the maintenance staff in to work on the toilet. The plumbers were friendly and responsive and got things working but it is just time for an update on the rooms. Housekeeping forgot to clean my room one day and while I was not a happy camper about that I did request a housekeeper be sent to my room and the person who came apologized for the oversight even though it was not her fault and took care of my room right away. I appreciated the front desk staff assistance for driving directions and neighborhood knowledge. We ate breakfast in the restaurant and while the buffet was not included in our room rate we did appreciate the reasonably priced meal options that were available.

Stay Report 112 114Location. The hotel is located on Louisiana Blvd. just north of I40. it is in a commercial development area which has several restaurants and a shopping plaza with a brand new Target and a Dilards in it all of which are walkable from the hotel. ABQ is a ten mile drive away and downtown Albuquerque is six miles away. The proximity to I40 makes it an easy base of operations to drive to Santa Fe too. Hotel. The property is an older property badly in need of renovation. it is a concrete hulking monolith which feels very 1980s inside from the hallway carpets to the old slow elevators and to the non renovated rooms. On the positive side there is a large parking lot indoor outdoor pool and a Concierge Lounge. Do note that the lounge is closed on weekends however. The lobby has a souvenir shop bar and restaurant and seating area. Check In Most employees were very friendly and the check in agent was one of the good ones. He apologized that the lounge was closed and offered breakfast coupons. Room. I really like the renovated Mariot rooms but this property does not have them yet. Therefore we had a room with a tiny and old television older style bathroom and a lone chair by the windows. On the positive side there were no issues with the wifi and the beds were comfortable. The fridge was a nice touch too. Breakfast. The coupons covered a buffet which had an omelet bar scrambled eggs pancakes sausage bacon and the usual cold items. The food was decent enough and service very good. The buffet is 2195 otherwise. Check Out. I was staying in the room with two friends and we were told our coupons did not cover three breakfasts just two. At check out I asked for the breakfast charge to be removed. The agent replied why for. I said that had the lounge not been closed we had have eaten there and I should not have to be penalized because of a closed lounge. The agent told me well you should have come and gotten another coupon. It went back and forth like this for a while until she relented. This left a very sour taste in my mouth about the hotel experience. My rate was 100 a night I do not think I had be back at least until the property is renovated.", "offset": [529, 675], "date": "2018-01-19", "cpt": "0", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 8, "uid": "dcc0b68f-3484-4867-8a23-fa7ce91390c6", "sentence": "Clean.

I have been to this hotel many times and have always had a good experience not so this visit. They appear to be understaffed. I checked in through the ap with electronic entry to the room selected. Check in was fine but the hotel was so full if you ever needed anything the staff was unhelpful. When I first entered my room it was nicely remodeled. However the phone displayed the wrong room number and the television said welcome Jenifer. the completely wrong person. My electronic key did not work. The second day of not functioning I tried to stop by the front desk but they only had one person there and the line to wait was so very long. I called the number that displays on the phone for help. It was the front desk. I explained to the lady that my electronic key was not working. She said I would need to go downstairs so they could reset it. I explained it was through my phone. She then said I would need to go downstairs to get a plastic key. I let her know I had one but I wanted my electronic key to work. She then told me that it sometimes takes a day or two for the electronic keys to reset from the previous customer. What. People check in and out daily but you have to wait a few days for your electronic key to work. I know she was wrong but they never did get my electronic key to work. It is pointless to try to speak to staff who are clueless. I have used my electronic key in other hotels without any issues. The hotel also has over 15 floors and only two carts for luggage. The staff at check in was friendly. The concierge staff member was also friendly but the room was so packed they could have used two people. Other than the girl on the phone I did not have much interaction with staff because the lines at the front desk were always so long I did nt wait. Other than these issues the room was clean and cool. I did have a mini fridge and coffee maker. For the cost of the room I would have expected better service. I will be returning again as this is my usual go to hotel.
