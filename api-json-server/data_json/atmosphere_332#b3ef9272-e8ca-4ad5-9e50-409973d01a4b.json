We have been going the Tradewinds for years and this has always been a wonderful getaway yet for some reason I get too busy to share a review \u2026 shame on me. We do our \u201c mom and dad \u201d getaways but this is always one that the kids love and we could n\u2019t do it without them. They stay busy the entire time and allow us to sip on some cocktails on the beach while they take part in all of the activities for the kids. The restaurants are phenomenal. Palm Court Italian Grill is always excellent the Flying Bridge near the pool and the beach is always hopping. If you want a table here around lunch time you \u2019l need to troll the tables to see who is wrapping up and paying their bill and wait or sit at the bar if there are only a few of you. If you only want a drink by the pool head to Saltys Polside Beach Bar and it \u2019l be much quicker near the adult only polMy son and I had breakfast at Bermudas which has a very good breakfast buffet. Beef O Bradys on site can quench your sports fix and we have seen and got autographs from local professional sports figures there in the past. This was our first time trying the Guy Harvey RumFish Grill \u2026 all I can say is WOW. The gigantic fish tank is amazing but the food was some of the best seafood that I have ever had and I am from Florida. Our entire table echoed that sentiment. There are bars everywhere. Regardless of your age you should try the Tradewinds Bar Crawl. It will have you checking out all of their locations. You get a passport and they stamp it at each location. It \u2019l net you a t shirt in the end but either way you really have to find these places and experience them like Redbeards Shark Tooth Tavern that is tucked away in the resort with some live music playing in the evenings like a small fishing town tavern. Another great stop is The Sand Bar down at Guy Harvey Outpost especially in the evenings they have fire pits for everyone from every age group to enjoy. I think they even do s\u2019mores down there for the kids. The biggest thing that I notice every time that I go is the familiar faces of the staff. Everything in that industry has churn but there are the staples that have been there for 17 years or so like the current manager of Flying Bridge. I finally stopped her to ask how long she \u2019s been working there and. 17 years in the food beverage industry is a tough tough job. Customers can behave as if they are staying at the Taj Mahal or they \u2019ve just had too much to drink and become belligerent. This staff does it all with a smile a friendly \u201c good morning \u201d and that is one of the biggest things that can make a huge difference in a \u201c average stay \u201d and an excellent stay \u201d. It also says allot for the Tradewinds and the way they treat their staff. The little things mean much more than other stays will ever understand. It rained one night and there were baskets of free umbrellas for the guests to use. Very easy to do for the Tradewinds but something that goes a long long way with the guests. We just got back from a Memorial Day weekend there with the kids. Very nice fireworks display right on the beach. A huge cookout I mean HUGE and a carnival on the beach. The views are great even of the courtyard but I highly recommend the beach front rooms for those amazing sunsets that rival anywhere else in the world our TripAdvisor logo is from one of our stays. The slide speaks for itself \u2026 I do n\u2019t have the time to touch on all of the amenities jet skis parasailing jetpack water playground \u2026. etc. you \u2019d have to check their website for all of that. or if you are like me TripAdvisor reviews for all the stuff there is to do at this wonderful place.", "offset": [1553, 1806], "date": "2015-05-25", "cpt": "0", "category": "atmosphere"}, {"id": 3, "uid": "e417be5f-8c58-4421-ba11-39d20cf2c099", "sentence": "We were here for the Rios wedding Friday.

Travelled to St Petersburg for three days in September 2015 with family and friends. Our group was comprised of adults only and my best friend coordinated the hotel stay as we all wanted to stay in a beach front hotel. Our experience was not optimal but in the spirit of honesty I can not blame the hotel for not meeting our expectations when we failed to make our due diligence. We are a group that prefers Adults Only hotel resorts with multiple restaurants and nightlife unfortunately it seemed that these type of exclusive resorts are not common in Tampa St. Pete so the TradeWinds seemed like a good enough resort for a three day getaway especially because of its popularity due to Rumfish Grill. The resort is already looking old and tired. My son and I stayed in an ocean front double suite which was comfortable and spacious but whose bed linens covers furniture bathroom and refrigerator were en par with older Motel 8 rooms. Unfortunately for us these oceanfront rooms are in the children \u2019s pool section and directly on the path towards the beach which makes it one of the noisiest and busiest traffic areas of the hotel and since the rooms have zero noise insulation you hear the children in the pool and everyone that walks by your room and everything they say as if you were sleeping sitting right outside with them. The restaurants are limited and all close very early except for one sports bar restaurant that closes at 10 PM. There is no nightlife or food whatsoever after 100 PM they only offer room service from 7 0 AM to 100 PM and since this is Tampa your only options after that are probably waffle houses or fast food restaurants open after hours. The St Pete beach is very pretty and its ocean waters are very calm you feel like you \u2019re swimming in one big pool. Again our experience was not optimal not because the hotel offered bad service per se or because it failed on any promise. Our bad experience is because the hotel did not meet our standards and that can only be blamed on us for not thoroughly researching our options. The hotel is not luxurious it is a budget Children \u2019s Vile hotel perfect for budget conscious families with children that only need a room to crash very early at night after a long day running after their energetic and boisterous young ones or for budget travelers that do not mind loud children.

At check in the front desk preauthorized another 200 for the purpose of being able to charge to the room during my stay which is fine and makes the day smoother. I did not appreciate being told several times that it was expected that I should spend more than 200 and that they really encourage their guests to spend money. I felt several times during my stay that I was being upsold. We had lunch at Flying Bridge and the food was very poor. It took over an hour to get our food and when it arrived it was cold. Two sandwiches a soft drink and a pina colada were over 60. The drink was too strong and overall the experience was not enjoyable. On the positive side the beach was very nice and the clamshells were a nice addition especially since it was not busy so we were able to get the front row. I did learn though that regularly they do charge to sit in the front row. something I have NEVER experienced at any other hotel usually it is just first come first serve. The hotel overall is somewhat run down and you have to walk through a shabby banquet area to get back to your room. The room was average although thankfully it was clean.

We took our 7 year old son to Tradewinds for a one night stay for his birthday we are local to the Tampa area it was the perfect place to have fun as a family. We arrived around noon and they let us check in to a room early typically check in is at 4 pm. PLUS they upgraded our room to a suite with kitchen living room that overlooked the beach front pool we had reserved a regular hotel room with no view. Perfect location. They also gave our son a hand written birthday card at check. in which immediately made him feel special. The positives Every single employee we came into contact with was extremely friendly and helpful. They were all sweet to our son and made him feel special on his birthday and made the whole experience very enjoyable. The pool areas were clean and laid out well. Always clean towels and always empty chairs available. The beach was wonderful clean open cabanas hammocks games. Tons of fun activities perfect for kids we rode the padleboats played in the pools roasted marshmallows at dusk listened to music mined for gems played tether ball and volleyball jumped on a trampoline bungee cord and all of us went down the giant inflatable water slide about 100 times. And of course played in the ocean which was shallow and had a great sandbar perfect for kids. There was also a ton of things we did not have time to do. Negatives. The only two things I would say is that first of all the on site restaurants food is VERY pricey but honestly that is to be expected at a resort hotel so not that big of a deal. The food we did eat was tasty and there are several options to choose from. Secondly the hotel rooms and amenities are rather out of date. Everything was clean and functional but you can tell it is been a sweet minute since anything has been updated. I am adding this only for other peoples benefits to us it did not matter at all and it gave the place a sort of retro charm. Also this was perfect for KIDS FAMILIES. I would probably not come here with adult friends or for a romantic getaway just because it is so kid friendly full of families. Yes they do have a 21 and up only pool area which is nice. but if I the chance to go somewhere without my child I would likely go to a more upscale more adult focused resort.

The restaurants where a little overpriced for the value but the resort is within walking distance from many great local restaurants that it was not a dealbreaker.
