We booked 2 interconnecting Superior Seaview rooms all rooms would have some view of the ocean through a travel retailer in Australia price beat after getting a quote from HotelTravelcom. I then contacted the hotel directly to ensure we would get the rooms which they did confirm. I think they have 2 or 3 sets of interconnecting rooms. We were tossing up whether to go for the Family Suite but we are glad we booked the interconnecting rooms as you get the extra bathroom which is brilliant. The rooms are very modern clean and ours had views to the ocean over the 1st floor courtyard area. The rooms are not massive but as we had interconnecting rooms this did not seem an issue. Excellent free Wifi everywhere around the hotel. get a free Re Ka Ta club password when you are down there as the hotel Wifi does slow down a bit when you are around the pool area. Breakfasts at Re Ka Ta restaurant were fantastic a small buffet selection as well as an a la carte are included plus coffee made to order and the staff are brilliant and attentive and also sit you where you like which was nice. A panoramic view of Kata Beach to have breakfast to each morning does not get better than that. The Re Ka Ta beach club which is part of the hotel has a fantastic infinity edge pool overlooking the beach plus plenty of sun lounges and day beds to loll away the hours. The pool area staff are excellent as well. Every morning at breakfast I saw them down on the beach in front of the hotel cleaning up rubbish and raking the sand. Plenty of towels too the guys will even race over to put one over your sun lounge or day bed for you. My son had a birthday whilst we were there and a day or two before without any prompting we were asked where we would like to have his complimentary birthday cake very thoughtful and very much appreciated thank you. This was our 3rd trip to Kata Beach and would by far have been our best yet thanks to our experience at the Boathouse. The staff are excellent and so very friendly and welcoming. We highly recommend Boathouse by Montara if you are looking for a quality holiday. You will not find a better location on Kata Beach and you get the boutique hotel experience.

We stayed here for a few nights as part of our honeymoon. it is in a great location and we really enjoyed our stay. The staff were lovely and when we arrived to our room they had left us a honeymoon cake and a big bunch of red roses which was a lovely surprise. Overall we felt this hotel was very over priced. The rooms while comfortable and clean were quite small and basic for the price they charge. The food was amazing in the restaurant but again very very expensive. it is 4 star rating is fair enough but they are charging 5 star prices. If they lowered their prices in line with other 4 star hotels of similar quality I had been giving a rating of 9 out of 10.

My husband I enjoyed a lovely 1 week stay at the Boathouse. I was initially a bit disappointed as we came from the Racha a beautiful resort on Ko Racha 45 min south of Phuket. the Boathouse was a bit of a downgrade. The rooms however were clean. The staff was lovely and could not be more helpful. The Boathouse is at the end of the strip of Kata beach which is really busy. There are no chairs provided by the hotel directly on the beach due to a law forbidding this which was recently passed. There is a view from the pool of the beach though. The food at the Boathouse grill Rekata were great as well as the breakfast which is included. The hotel is in walking distance to many bars and restaurants.

We had researched hotels and locations for our holiday with our 2 children at length. We read the reviews on The Boathouse and looked at their website we thought it sounded perfect for us. Imagine our shock when we arrived to find that the hotel was far from what we had expected. The location is busy noisy road side with the appearance being old tired and run down. The hotel reception is dark and dismal the staff of similar appearance. No Thai smiles greeted us here. I had to check we had been taken to the right place. After checking in this is what we sawTired restaurant with gloomy table linen. Filthy pools with grime around the inside of them. Not fit to put my dog in let alone meThe surrounding the polsides were dirty. The sun beds were black with mould. The wooden sun beds devoid of stain or paint. Fit for the tip and the other style of sun beds were rusty. Sun bed cushions were split with the filling spilling out of them. The steps and tiles around the pools were broken and yellow in colour. Guttering was broken and just left on the floor. The bedding and towels grey in colour much past their best. Both our rooms had a horrible smell to them which had been tried to be covered up. The beach front description was a joke admitting I could see the sea but I was not beach front. The room was in the corner of a court yard. dirty polside. When we have previously booked beach front elsewhere in Thailand I have stepped out of my room onto the sand. The room booking was wrong even after I had emailed the hotel prior to our arrival to confirm we required a twin for our 21 and 25 year old son and daughter. They could not sort out the mistake suggesting they give our children extra pillows to put down the centre of the bed. ApalingWhen we complained we were met with frosty and unhelpful faces who suddenly could not understand or speak English. No wifi was available or telephones offered to assist us to sort out our unhappiness. We vacated the hotel to use our mobile phone to call our tour operator who did sort our problem very quickly. We were refunded 7 nights out of 8 booked. It was the local agent however who charged us for the night we did not stay there. We did not want to spend a single night then it was so disgusting. Hotel from hell best describes this experience. This is our first and hopefully last experience where the hotel has not met the standards and expectations.", "offset": [1484, 1641], "date": "2016-07-27", "cpt": "0", "category": "room"}, {"id": 6, "uid": "54011706-5eca-4f5a-881f-80144c856ac8", "sentence": "Great location for family holiday. After extensive research into booking a hotel in Phuket for our family holiday we decided to choose the Boathouse by Montara at Kata Beach for a 6 night relaxing break. We were travelling as a group of 6 adults and 2 young children 19 months and 3 months old and overall the hotel was ideal for our needs. Having the beachfront suite meant we had convenient access to the beach at all times plus we had beautiful sunset views every evening. The suites are a good size ideal for letting our toddler run around freely and make use of the ample living space. We made regular use of room service however we did find this to be quite expensive. In addition given the price we paid for this hotel I would expect room service to be available 24 hours but was disappointed that due to a delay in our flight and distance from the airport by the time we checked in on the first night the kitchen was already closed so we had to purchase food from a nearby restaurant which the hotel did help us with. The breakfast selection was simple yet comprehensive and was plentiful for even our vegetarian requirements. We enjoyed the custom fresh juices each morning. The spa was excellent and our family made extensive use of this by having massages on a daily basis the quality of which were excellent. The infinity pool whilst small is still beautiful and has a stunning view overlooking the sea. The smaller pool outside the main restaurant is great for young kids. Location is ideal for finding restaurants and shops within walking distance. Hotel were able to help us with booking taxis plus a trip to Fantasea. For other island tours eg James Bond island you are better off grabbing leaflets from nearby tour operators which are considerably cheaper than the ones offered by the Boathouse. Overall though given the cost of staying at this hotel I would expect the staff to be more friendly and have better English plus have more cover during the night shift when it seemed to be just 1 person on duty. Other reviewers have expressed concern over the availability of sunbeds by the pool and cleanliness of the beach but we did not experience any issues with these at all. I did get asked if I was a guest at the hotel before I say on a sunbed. so looks like the policing of this has improved. So overall quality of accommodation excellent we had 2 suites and 1 standard room food on site was good but expensive location ideal for families wanting quiet beach holiday but I do feel staff could improve by improving their English and taking more interest in helping their guests to have a great holiday.", "offset": [591, 674], "date": "2016-08-31", "cpt": "0", "category": "room"}, {"id": 7, "uid": "f7c761b8-7f85-44c3-9fa3-17ef5f7fc12f", "sentence": "Wonderful Location and Great Service. My husband and I stayed at the Boathouse for eight nights in November 2016 and we greatly enjoyed our stay overall. The hotel is perfectly located on Kata Beach the beach is absolutely stunning and it is perfect for swimming and water sports. There are a few restaurants located directly outside the hotel and it is about a 5 minute walk to the main road that has lots of great restaurants and spas. We booked a Family Seaview Suite and although we liked the room we were disappointed that the room did not match the description on the Boathouses website. Specifically the website states that the Family Seaview Suite features ground floor suites with direct beach access which is one of the key reasons I selected this room. Our room however was located on the third floor 304 and had no direct beach access. Additionally we really had to crane our necks to see the sea from the balcony the room instead looked out onto the restaurant and courtyard pool. Furthermore although the website states that the bathrooms are sunlit we had very little natural light in the room and the lighting in the bathroom was quite poor. The Boathouse should change its website to correct these inaccuracies. That being said the room was quite clean and spacious. Although the bedding could have been softer the bed was comfortable and big. The bathroom had two sinks and a large bathtub and shower. We were really impressed with housekeeping they did such a great job tidying our room each day and we had no issue when we forgot to close our safe one day. The hotel was extremely gracious with respect to the complimentary water it provides to guests we received two large bottles and two smaller bottles each day for drinking and brushing our teeth. We also received a variety of complimentary fruit in our room each day along with a newspaper. One issue when we turned on our tv the last few nights of our stay the tv showed the names of two other guests at the hotel. We called the front desk about this and they said there was an issue with the connection in our room and that they linked us to another room instead. For privacy purposes I do not think the other guests would have liked to know that their names and room number was shown to us each day. Plus I worried that our personal details were shown to other guests. This was never fixed despite our call. Guests at the Boathouse have access to Re Ka Ta Beach Club which is right next to the hotel. Despite spotty service from the staff on some days we found the Beach Club access to be one of the greatest perks of the hotel. Our access included two chairs towels an umbrella and continually refreshed water. Additionally the staff brought fruit skewers to guests every few hours. The pool is somewhat small but it is long enough to swim mini laps and cool off from the hot sun. You can also order food and drinks do not miss the Singapore Slings. On most days the staff at the Beach Club was quite helpful. On a few days however it was difficult to find anyone staffing the pool. Perhaps the Beach Club could hire one additional employee. Although we did not eat at the Boathouse restaurant we ordered room service and food at the Beach Club on several occasions. The food was delicious especially the chicken pad thai and cheesecake. The breakfast was simply ok. it did not match the stellar quality of the food prepared for lunch and dinner. The bar area was pretty vapid and cold each night. Although the hotel offers a happy hour from 5 7 pm the staffing was poor and the bar area was not exciting. Perhaps a refurbishment is in order sometime in the future. The front desk staff seemed genuinely happy to see us each day and were incredibly helpful throughout our stay. From helping us with taxis to dinner reservations the front desk staff set the tone for a comfortable stay for us. On the last day our airport transfer failed to pick us up. The hotel kindly came to our rescue and drove us to the airport right away. We will not forget these acts of kindness. Despite the few issues we had we had a wonderful stay at the Boathouse and would not hesitate to return.", "offset": [594, 763], "date": "2016-11-20", "cpt": "0", "category": "room"}, {"id": 8, "uid": "3569bdab-e0fa-411f-b83c-78e7bd172b14", "sentence": "Right on one of Phukets Best Beaches.

Every day was spent at the Rekata Beach Club relaxing on the comfy loungers overlooking the very small pool but more importantly the beautiful view of Kata Beach. The staff were excellent and looked after us very well and a big plus is that our daughter and her partner were able to join us each day by paying a small daily fee that was then deducted off our our lunch or drinks. Breakfast was delicious each day with eggs cooked on demand and our one dinner at the Boathouse Wine and Grill was excellent as it has been on previous visits. Our only disappointment was the room itself. We had booked the Hideaway Suite on the top floor as it was advertised as having the most amazing views from its rooms and private terrace. This was true the views were beautiful but unfortunately they could only be seen by standing up at the windows or terrace railing not from the loungers couches or the bed. In hindsight we should have saved a large sum of money and booked a smaller room on the second or third floor with floor to ceiling windows and a balcony.

We moved over to The Boathouse from another hotel and I \u2019m so glad we did. As you arrive you receive a warm welcome from the security outside to the front desk staff. They truly make you feel at home. They seated us in this beautiful bar area overlooking the ocean and provided us with a list of \u201c welcome drinks \u201d from cocktails fresh juices to tea or coffee. My husband and I both ordered mojitos which were refreshing. We were then treated to the most amazing canap\u00e9s from their phenomenal restaurant. Later we were greeted by the manager who asked us where we \u2019re from or if we \u2019re celebrating a special occasion and told us a bit about the hotel. She allowed us to check in almost two hours early without an issue as the rooms were already available. In the room we were welcomed with our names on our tv and a sweet hand written card welcoming us to the hotel. They had also left a fruit basket and more canap\u00e9s I could n\u2019t get over how fantastic the food was. You will find the room stocked with a variety of tea and coffee as well as a jar of complimentary biscuits and nuts. And if you \u2019re in the mood for a bottle of wine or cocktail the bar fridge is stocked. We decided to spend the day at the pool the view from the pool will have you in awe and were wonderfully surprised when we found two glasses of ice water waiting for us. We were later offered complimentary fresh juice and fruit. They also leave novels on the table for you to read while you \u2019re lying in the sun. The next morning at breakfast overlooking the ocean we were given a \u201c \u00e0 la carte menu \u201d with options such as grilled salmon eggs Florentine tower of pancakes and much more.

THE BADThe room we were moved to was close to the road and the boom boom of taxis sound systems kept me awake till 2 am THE UNACCEPTABLE. We arrived at the hotel and the reception reservation procedures were shambolic. Three people were trying to check us in while answering phones and attending to other guests enquirers. And that also happened at check out and we witness that happening with other guests. The staff seem obsessed in selling you upgrades to better rooms. Now the unacceptable part which in 30 years of travelling I have never heard of. Because of the time delay in reserving a room at reception we decided to book online while sitting at the lobby desk. We were given a lovely large room with a stunning roof terrace we unpacked and were changed and ready to go to the pool. The reception called and said they wanted to move a complaining guest to our room and we would get an upgrade. A Young reception girl knocks on door and asks us if we do not like the room. We replied we were happy with it. She looked confused so she rang reception to say we wanted to stay in the room. Next minute she puts the phone down and says the manager is coming up. This lady turns up and says she would move us to a better room but when we chalanged the reasons why wanted us out she came up with loads of excuses and lies. She then grabbed our bags and off we go to a room that is a downgrade not an upgrade without a balcony and close to the road Later I confronted her and asked her why I was moved and if it was hotel policy to move guests for no reasons and mislead and lie to them. The reply was obviously NOTHIS IS NOT THE HOTEL POLICY. When I asked her why then move us she said oh. It was my mistake. The weird thing is the room type we had originally been given was still available on line for the rest of the day so she moved us for moving us for no reason. We received a bottle of champagn canap\u00e9s but our whole day had been ruined because we could not stop thinking of the way she had conned us out of the room. On leaving the hotel the following morning the staff were very offish apart from the young trainee girl who was very sweet.
