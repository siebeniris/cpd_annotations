I think that when you are doing a multi centred holiday it is inevitable that you compare hotels. The New World in Saigon is definitely the hotel we have liked the least. It certainly is n\u2019t a 5 star hotel by European standards. The whole hotel needs to be modernised. The furniture in the lobby and bar are looking very shabby and out of date. The same can be said about the rooms. Our room was relatively large but everything is looking very tired. I would only give them about 510 for cleanliness. The bathroom was even worse. Tiles need re grouting and there is a grubby shower curtain around the bath. The shower attachment squirted water out everywhere. The inside of the bath is stained. It should all have been updated several years ago. On arrival we decided to eat in the hotel for our first night. The whole thing was a disaster. We were given a table on a mezzanine overlooking the lobby. There was a wedding being held that day. Children from the wedding were running around the lobby on their own screaming and shouting. Because of the acoustics of the front entrance the noise was unbelievable. There were several hotel staff there but no attempt was made to quieten the children. It was like trying to eat a meal in a children \u2019s playground. When we complained about it the staff really were unable to cope with us and the problem. Their attitude towards us was in fact rather insulting. They did send us a basket of fruit as compensation but it really did n\u2019t compensate for the spoilt meal and the incompetent staff. Having said that we generally found the rest of the hotel staff very pleasant and helpful. The worst problem about the hotel however is the constant roar of the traffic. The hotel has roads on three sides and from most parts of the building including the rooms there is a constant day and night drone of traffic noise. The windows are only single glazed. We were not happy in this hotel nor could we recommend it to anyone.", "offset": [249, 288], "date": "2016-03-03 00:00:00", "cpt": "0", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 3, "uid": "4bb71388-994d-4e3e-8d99-c3073ac7d4ab", "sentence": "Right in the guts of everything.
