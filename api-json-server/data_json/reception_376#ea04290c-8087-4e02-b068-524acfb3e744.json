The good Great location ideally situated between town centre and marina. Room was one of the ones recently renovated very nicely done. Nice bathroom with walk in power shower. Bed very comfortable.

Pool area nice with adequate sunbeds but only if enough people decide to go to the beach on the free shuttle bus. If every resident decided to stay at the pool I do not know what would hapenThe badNo view from our room and looking at the layout of the complex I doubt there is a view from any room. Lots of areas of the hotel have not been renovated and are quite tired generally not up to standard of Tivoli hotels we have stayed in previously. Public areas scruffy and dirty entrance walkway very dirty and littered. Has nt been swept or power washed for a long time. Pool area was nt cleaned during the day plastic glasses and bottles blew around in the wind and sunbeds always had remnants of someone elses suncream on them. Half a dot deducted for this. Full dot deducted for the staff unfortunately. Any establishment is only as good as the engaged friendly and helpful staff that run it. With the exception of reception staff we felt we were an inconvenience to all the other staff. Pool bar staff in particular seemed stressed and hassled by having to deal with people and long waits and frankly unfriendly service were the result. Staff in other Tivoli hotels always had a friendly hello for us as we walked by even down to bedroom staff. Not in Lagos. Not sure if it is down to lack of numbers lack of training or poor morale.

I read the other reviews and still decided to stay here. If you want a hotel vibe instead of an Airbnb then this is one of the few options to avoid driving or walking to far to be in the center of Lagos. But the hotel itself was not luxury. We were promised one double bed and my boyfriend and I ended up having to sleep in seperate single beds. When we asked for another room we were given this disgusting room with a vomit covered towel laying on the floor in the bathroom on the 1st floor which feels like you are in the dungeon or basement of the hotel. There was no internet service down there so we moved back to our other room. Seems suspicious there were no other rooms we could be put in since the hotel looked huge and not at capacity. The customer service described in other reviews was accurate. I \u2019m not sure if the staff is overworked or just unhappy to be there but they made us feel like an inconvenience over the room situation which seems unfair when we paid for a double bed and are just asking for them to honor that. Even the wait staff seemed to be annoyed by questions. A lot of the guests we ran into were lost trying to navigate the hotel so I \u2019m sure the staff gets asked a lot of questions but this is a hospitality business and I chose to pay to stay in a hotel vs an airbnb to be able to have someone help me when needed.
