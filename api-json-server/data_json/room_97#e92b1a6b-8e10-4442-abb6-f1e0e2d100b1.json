I watched the sunset from my balcony. Everyone on staff were very eager to ensure I was comfortable. I was even looking for a local ice cream shop and the front desk gave me a few ideas and did not push room serviceThe downfall is that with the VIP reservation I was given the free breakfast buffet. Super right. When I went to use the coupon the first day for breakfast the waiter was excellent and made sure my coffee was full and I have everything I needed. The second day I had another waiter that asked if I had a coupon for the breakfast. My husband said we did and all of the sudden the waiter played the disappearing act. We did not get our coffee for a long time and I had to ask another server for it and cream. He was not even around for a refill. I suppose that he thought he would not get a tip because we did not pay for the breakfast. When he gave us the receipt and indicated to put our room number down he was very clear on where we would put how much we wanted to tip him. For a waiter that did not help at all he was undeserving of a tip however my husband did insist on leaving him a couple of bucks. I had come back and stay again as I am frequently in the area but I will not be eating there. Most of the staff the bright and airy atrium and facilities the sunset from my balcony.

Across the road from hotel is a car rental storage area where transporters regularly on and off load cars.

My wife son and I stayed overnight at the Radison Hotel Newport Beach. First of all the location is barely Newport Beach as it is very close to the John Wayne Airport and NOT near what most people would consider Newport Beach. You would definitely need a car if you wanted to go to anyplace in Newport Beach or Orange County. The hotel itself looks quite dated and there was even a picture in the lobby of planned improvements. The front desk people were quite friendly and efficient. While we used a free night certificate we were acknowledged as Club Carlson elite members. However we received no benefits just as a side note at both IHG and Hilton properties we routinely are offered free breakfastThe room itself was okay. It did have a microwave refrigerator and hdtv. Curiously the HDTV offered only analog stations so it was like watching a tv from the 1990s. The beds were fine. The room needed painting the bathroom door was chipping at the bottom the tub looked like it had been patched and the bathtub and bathroom faucet plugs looked like 25 year old originals. We did appreciate the free parking and the free wifi was adequate. Overall if I needed a flight from SNA I would accept this hotel as functional.
