The note said to have a happy birthday and let them know if we needed anything it was addressed to my daughter and also mentioned her DOLL by name. This was a wonderful birthday surprise. I called home to see if my husband had set it up but it was really all from the front desk staff. Hours later when our room service was delivered this employee also wished my daughter a happy birthday for the next day AND as we were checking at the next day employees asked about her big day.

We got a great deal on this hotel through Honors. In addition we were upgraded to a corner room upon arrival which gave us a walk in closet bathroom with a shower and full tub and a great view of the lake and city. The receptionist that helped us was very nice. A couple of tips 1. There is a Whole Foods diagonal to the hotel. We ate breakfast here and stopped by on a couple of occasions to get water and drinks. This was very helpful. 2. There is a bike rental within one block toward Michigan ave that you can rent a bike for 10 for a 24 hour period. This was very helpful instead of using Lyft3. We flew into Midway 3 per person and got off at Lake State and took a Lyft to the hotel total6 ride. This was convenient and easy4. Sign up for Lyft if you have not used it before. They will give you 20 in free ride credits and there are tons of drivers in the city and it is WAY cheaper than taking a cab.
