Arrived at the hotel at around noon and was told that I would have to wait until 2PM to get my room but that it would be worth the wait. Being the skeptical traveler that I am I was pleasantly surprised when I finally went up to the room. The room was spacious very spacious with the bathroom separate from the toilet and having a shower and a large sitting tub. As far as the condition of the room goes there were a few faults. Nothing that one can not find in other hotels at the same level but the maintenance chief needs to wake up and start doing his job. The room I think it was room 814 has a balcony with a sea view booked in advance and paid extra for only partially obstructed by another building. I have no idea how the other standard rooms are but it seems that some face the large parking lot and some may face an adjoining building that is quite close to the hotel. Breakfast was good. The only complaint is about the orange juice which has an odd taste and tastes nothing like fresh juice but otherwise there was a wide variety and of good quality. WiFi was available in the room free of charge but I think that is only true for the Deluxe rooms. To summarize the Le Meridien is very good but if you plan on staying at this hotel I would strongly recommend booking a Deluxe or Sea View room.", "offset": [1081, 1178], "date": "2015-07-10", "cpt": "0", "category": "general"}, {"id": 4, "uid": "782bb585-7f16-4b98-8132-ebf935eee1b2", "sentence": "Nice hotel.

The hotel itself was fine. Our room was a good size clean and had a good bed which is crucial in my eyes. The balcony looked onto a wall so we obviously did not bother going on it so if you want to spend any time in your room I suggest you pay a bit more for a view. The location was not great there are much prettier places in Malta. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The indoor spa was fairly nice but the outdoor pool was a bit of a let down. One warning re Malta generally taxis are incredibly expensive. The hotel has a list of the prices that fares should be so check before you get charged 1520 euros for a 5 min drive. The bus from the airport usually stops next to the hotel according to the website but the roads were apparently closed when we were there and the unhelpful bus driver did not let us know. We ended up half way back to the airport before anyone realised and were left stranded waiting 40 mins for a cab.

Just returned from staying at Le Meridien for a week with my boyfriend. The hotel is in Baluta Bay which is only a short walk to St Julians and is in a busy popular area. We stayed on the 3rd floor and paid for room only we did not upgrade for a better view and therefore could only see palm trees and not much light. But the room was very large and the bathroom and bed was very spacious for just the two of us. The room was cleaned regularly and it was great to have AC available. Towels were provided by the pool area great rooftop area there were ample beds for people and there was a bar by the pool for refreshments. The gym was good and the concierge was very helpful during our stay. Free wifi in the lobby was also included. Spa facilities were also good sauna steam room indoor pool and towels for the pool were also given. Good transport links to Valetta and surrounding areas and also taxis were available if not slightly more expensive than a bus trip. There were some great restaurants near by but you may need to pre book for some depending on when you go. The only complaint I have is that it did not feel like 5 stars there was no kettle in the room and 2 of the lights did not work. I understand things can break. be missing but after having to ask on 3 separate occasions it got a bit tedious. I also felt that not all of the receptionists were fully committed to helping with queries. We were often stood at the downstairs bar waiting to be served and ended walking out after having not been asked our order the bar was not very busy at this time so I do not understand the reason for this. I was also informed by reception that we should be given complimentary bottled water in our room daily but this only happened on the last 2 days of our stay. I had love to go back to Malta and would stay at the hotel again but believe a few things could be changed for it to reflect a 5 star hotel.", "offset": [1251, 1331], "date": "2015-09-09", "cpt": "0", "category": "general"}, {"id": 7, "uid": "5733e9d7-cf3c-4e2c-a325-60e40a7d3c67", "sentence": "Best 60th Birthday.

They said I did not have to because of the way my reservation was booked so all OK. Then the next morning I went to have breakfast and when I finished they came with a bill and asked me to pay on the spot. I did not have my wallet with me of course so I asked if I could settle at check out. They said no because I had not given a credit card when I checked in so I had to pay then and there. That was bad communication and manners they should have asked my at check in to give them my card and not ask me to pay my breakfast on the spot.

My girl friend and I recently stayed at the Le Meridien in Malta for 4 days.

The food and drink options in the lounge were very nice. I am an SPG gold member and we were upgraded to an amazing 2 room sea view suite on the 11th floor with exec floor access at check in. The suite was very well appointed with super comfy bed a master bath with soaking tub and separate glass shower with rain shower head. The living room was large and the second full bath was very convenient as I had to get up at 630am to shower and head to the conference and I could do so with out disturbing my girl friend. Each room also had an really nice oversized balcony were one could just sit relax and soak in the amazing view. Our first night there we arrived a little late so we decided to eat at the hotel restaurant which in some cases can be average to disappointing but it ended up being one of the best meals we had there even after going out to close by recommended venues which were also excellent.
