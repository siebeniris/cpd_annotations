While beautiful and clearly well looked after the main issue we had with this resort was how isolated it was. A great destination if you want privacy good food and a great spot to just simply relax and unwind. We felt very safe at this resort while we thoroughly enjoyed not having people on the beach trying to sell us assorted junk. Our room was clean spacious and had a luxurious feel to it. The bed was comfortable and the shower had plenty of pressure. Our balcony view was horrible and consisted of us looking directly into a large bush. On day one of our stay house keeping showed up at 50 pm which was a little late when we were just relaxing and getting ready for the evening resulting in our asking them to come back the following day. While we never ate a full restaurant meal at the resort we did find affordable options at the bar and polside grille. The breakfast buffet was reportedly 20 each which was far more than we were willing to spend on breakfast. Anyone we spoke to who ate at resort did enjoy the food while finding it a little more expensive then you had perhaps typically pay. Room service for a club sandwich with fries and burger with fries was 30 tip included. As the food was plentiful and tasty we were OK with such a bill. Attending a 90 minute presentation on the Club Options program we were impressed by Alfredo and John who laid out the program were patient showing us rooms and answering our questions while not obnoxiously pressuring us. When all was said and done the program simply was not for us. One thing we did not like about the resort overall was they had a red level status for certain patrons. A red level VIP lounge private pool and various other red level amenities that the general registered population was not welcome to access served to make us feel like a lower class guest. Not sure what it took to acquire the red level status but our blue wristbands served to clearly identify as us visitors who did not meet the criteria. Overall I would give this resort a 910 as a beautiful well kept destination with great pools well manicured landscaping plenty of places to sit and relax while having an overall clean appearance. Avis Car Rental has a booth on site while we found the young woman helpful and friendly in assisting us with a rental. A helpful hint would be booking such a rental in advance as they do have a limited number of cars. Also make sure your GPS works in Puerto Rico as ours which we had brought with us from Canada did not resulting in our getting lost for 2 hours one night. The staff we dealt with at the front desk and concierge were friendly and helpful while we also loved that we never got the sense employees had their hands out waiting for tips. My wife and I both agree that we would not stay here again as we simply enjoy being closer to the communities we are visiting while we like having affordable dining options within walking distance.", "offset": [2295, 2413], "date": "2015-01-25", "cpt": "0", "category": "parking"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "de4a0a68-70d7-4187-858c-b73da3f4c55b", "sentence": "resort grounds beach pool and the room itself were all great. if you can come during the week as the resort can be nearly empty at times. outside of that everything is overpriced. drinks bar food parking yes parking and especially restaurants. great places to eat in loquilo make eating most of your meals at the resort wasteful. rent a car for your stay herecheck in took almost half an hour. and we were not waiting in line. just two adults. easy access to el yunqueparking fees of 15 a day are literally price gouging. tons of parking in the middle of nowhere.", "offset": [180, 243], "date": "2015-02-01", "cpt": "0", "category": "parking"}, {"id": 2, "uid": "b9259c53-f561-4141-a187-43a5d245f35b", "sentence": "Beautiful resort for an older crowd. I just got back from staying at the Gran Melia. We rented a jeep from the airport and drove straight there. This resort is off the beaten path a bit. I highly recommend renting a vehicle at the airport and not at the resort. the resort rentals are very limited. The grounds are beautiful very well maintained plenty of help when you need it. Get the RED Level small money for many more privileges on the resort. The pool and food by the pool were good. We only ate at the restaurant once on the resort. spent more time off the resort exploring Puerto Rico plenty to see. The rooms are well kept and the cleaning service was great. my only real complaint was that there was very little to do at night. They only have 1 bar open at night and very poor attempts at music entertainment. They have a DJ for a couple nights which is ok but we saw some pretty bad live acts glorified Karaoke singers. I would highly recommend doing a day trip to Culebra amazing island buy ferry tickets in advance they sell out quickly with only 3 ferries going out a day.

We arrived at the resort in our rental car. We were immediately turned around and sent to the parking lot. Could not leave the car in the drive to check in. They sent a golf car over to pick us and our luggage up and bring us to check in. The first person at the registration desk was pleasant but that was about it. No smiles welcome to Puerto Rico did you have a nice trip nothing. She had no clue where are rooms were. It did not bother me much since I am pretty confident I can find my way around a resort. Again the guy in a golf car took us and our luggage on a brief ride around the resort and to our rooms. Beautiful room. Extremely clean comfortable. Working air. Tidey and seemed well kept. We dropped off our things and immediately left the resort to explore Puerto Rico. We did this exact routine for 5 days. Left the place for a local food place traveled all over Puerto Rico and returned to our rooms usually after 9 pm 1 day. The day before we left we spent in the pool on the beach and in the restaurant on site. Firstly this was our worst meal in Puerto Rico. Snobby waiter snobby host ok at best food and WAY OVER priced. Not that it was send it back to the kitchen bad it was edible but not very good. The pool was wonderful. Clean crystal clear and big. It was a pool 20 feet from the ocean. Being an avid swimmer that is where I went. Corse sand brought you into a mine field of rocks. Not sharp ones big ones. Stumble over hard to walk on big rocks. Once you got past those there was the sea grass. Everywhere. Not slimy or anything just annoying. About 100 feet out and the water was nearly 3 feet deep. We had double red flags every day we were there so we were not supposed to be in the water but since I am a very advance swimmer I went in anyway. There are some drops to about 5 feet deep but they are small and the water quickly rises to 2 feet deep. The beach was average at best. Nothing special except it is the Caribean and the Ocean is beautiful. Did not eat at the pool bar. Did not drink in the bar. Stayed out the resort as much as possible. Best way to visit the Gran Melia. Food is so much better a mile or 2 down HWY 3. Walking out of the resort it is fun to watch the Egrets and the Iguanas. But they are everywhere. We went to the on site marriage people who tried to help us arrange the renewal of our vows. We had been gone for so much of our time we put it off until it was not possible. He apologized to a great extent and we reassured him we understood it was our fault. They sent 6 chocolate covered strawberries to our room that night to say Happy Anniversary to us from the staff. My wife and I were stunned and grateful. It was a wonderful gesture. All in all our stay here was good. We were never on the resort for more than sleep but the rooms were beautiful comfortable always refreshed and cleaned and had not a single issue with anything. I highly recommend it with the only drawback being the restaurants on site will set you back a bunch.", "offset": [30, 73], "date": "2015-02-26", "cpt": "0", "category": "parking"}, {"id": 6, "uid": "322dcdee-32aa-4ead-b693-2787b24839b1", "sentence": "Great Location Take a Rental Car.

The hotel is in need of intensive TLC. When you hear Melia you think of employees working beyond expectation not at this Melia resort. Unfortunately the service was not extraordinary they do not have service out on the beach pool. If you are by the beach pool and would like a drink food you have to get up and WAIT by the bar. They seem to be short staff for the huge location they are currently running. The main pool is in need of major repair the pool wall is chipping and you can tell how dirty it is they need to clear it out and pressure clean and repair the entire pool. Also a lot of the hotel common areas are moldy looking in which needs to be cleaned out. The room was very clean and they had maids clean the rooms on a daily basis. The sofa beds are in need of a change of mattress they are sunken in the middle. No activities whatsoever my kids were extremely bored. Restaurant prices are out of hand they also have a closed down restaurant which seems to have been a buffet style but its no longer in service. Not sure what is going on here but it seems as though this place wo nt last very long. Lobby needs more staff to assist guests on a timely manner the staff was very helpful but need more assistance. Another thing is that parking is not included on your nightly rate nothing to do on the resort or close by so a car is needed to get out. The resort has a huge piece of land and still think that its ok to charge a daily parking fee with the amount of empty land. The staff was helpful when asked for assistance.

This is a golf resort. You will need a rental car to stay here unles you want to rely on a taxi or a private driver. Here we go. this is an impressive place with a greek palace theme and lots of security. In fact there where two guard gated security entrances. This is good. From the first entrance. its about 2 miles to the hotel. Also this place is good for hanging out by the pool and enjoying some night life at the large bar and 3 restaurants. Also the place has a gym and massage therapy services if you are into that. Some nightlife meaning music at the bar and just hanging out. This place can get full but when we went it was not that crowded. But watch out for weekend staying if you rent a car and come in late you will not find parking. Or if you do you could be waking far. Maybe. Restaurant eats when we went only one restaurant was open the night we stayed to eat there. The restaurant is called Pasion by Chef Myrta. Very good place to eat with excellent service. more info below. Okay. once again. this is a golf resort. so if you do not play golf. you might not care for this place. you are far away from the San Juan area. about 12 miles. Or at the very least 30 minute drive. You have to go far to find a place to eat if you do not want to eat at the resort restaurants. Pool area is impressive. however. there is loud music at the pool bar which at times can get annoying. They can play salsa merenge which is good. But on occasion you will hear regeton music. I think that s what is called and if you are not a fan of it. you will go crazy. Good service however at the pool bar area with a seating area to view the ocean. BTW. The music also muffles out the ocean sound of the beach near by. Which I think is a negative. The beach not much of it. Very rocky and not a beach you would go to. You can go to it. but its not a smooth sand area. However if you want a beach near by is Luquilo beach. about 10 minutes east of the hotel. You can go to Luquilo beach which we like. which has an entrance fee of 4 with tax. the beach has lots of sand area. palm trees for shade and very calm waters and a nice place to hang out all day. BTW. I am skipping back here. the restaurant I mentioned above is excellent with excellent service. A hostess name Stephanie and a waiter name Francisco. where absolutely professional classy and funny. They have other people there but these are the ones that we received service from. If you run into them you will be impressed. I would hire them in a nano second if I had a restaurant. Over all the folks at this entire place are nice and will cater to your needs. Also I forgot. the employees do run around in smaller golf carts at the complex to take you if you want from the lobby to your rooms carry your luggage or to your car if you do not want to walk. You will most likely use them because sometimes is far from the parking lot. You will see what I mean. They do also tend to drive somewhat fast around the area which is kind of weird. Is like a race track sometimes. I thought it was funny but just be careful.
