I get the luxury of staying with the kids while my wife goes to class. The hotel is super clean and the rooms are good sized. If you get on the upper floors you get the lounge access for free drinks during happy hour and also liquor is offered at a nominal fee. In the morning breakfast is complete and the atmosphere is great. The pool is very large with a nice hot tub. It is an italian themed pool and it is surrounded by windows bringing in a ton of light. Its the best hotel pool I have seen outside of vegas. Usually during the day we have the pool to ourselves so if you are reading this please do not come in late March I like the streak we are on. We have gone now for over 10 years and not once had anything but a great experience. One year we had a blizzard and could not get out and they gave us a free night and fed the family. Lastly you can walk to Easton shopping as its less than 40yards away. My only issue at all is parking. Its really hard to park close to the hotel as many Easton shoppers takes spots.

I was there on a weeknight for business and was surprised at how lukewarm the service was for what must be an important audience the business traveler who usually pays full rate and does not need a lot of amenities wi fi a gym some room service. The room service was good and the gym is fine. But my greeting upon arrival was to use the word again lukewarm. I am a Gold Hilton Honors member and there was no welcome extended which I know to be a standard nor was I able to access the concierge floor. When at 8 pm I was a little hungry after traveling all day my only option was full room service there is no pantry or snack bar to get a bag of chips some tylenol or any other sundries. This is really surprising but it makes me think the hotel really caters to leisure travelers shoppers and the business traveler is not a focus. The next morning as I struggled to get out of the doors with multiple bags the two doorman stood and watched me come through the doors.

We travel to Columbus every year and always stay at this hotel for an extended period of time. We \u2019ve always enjoyed it \u2019s convenient location to great shops and restaurants. While that has n\u2019t changed a lot of other things have. This year the hotel has finally reopened after a major renovation. We were very excited to see the \u201c improvements \u201d but the hotel atmosphere went from a warm inviting and quaint spot to a cold corporate and sterile shell. The new front desk is impractical. The back office is n\u2019t connected to it so if you have to pick up a package or laundry or anything it is a long wait for them to retrieve your items. The old sports bar that was here is now gone and has turned into meeting rooms. The room service menu has been dumbed down and is n\u2019t as extensive as it used to be. Another gripe is if you order a drink at the lobby bar you have to pay 2 if you would like a scoop of the bar nuts they have in a giant jar there. Mind you the sports bar used to give out hot fresh popcorn complimentaryThe rooms that were newly redone are also showing extensive wear and tear. Frayed and stained carpets etc. Also much of the staff we have come to know and enjoy over the years have all basically quit minus one or two gentleman at the valet who are always amazing. I think the next time we return we will try the new Embassy Suites down the street or stay in the Short North or downtown area. It \u2019s too bad because this hotel and its staff used to be very enjoyable. They maybe should have surveyed some of their past guests or gotten their input on how best to modify and redo the hotel.
