When we went to our room in the VILLAS there was mold in the bathroom. Needless to say we immediately went to the front desk and the lady found us room in the TOWER. She was very helpful and understanding. I must say this is a very old hotel and needs MAJOR renovation. The food is outrageously overpriced. The nicest thing about this hotel is the pool and beach area.

The staff was excellent the location was great but the rooms were disgusting. As you walk out the elevator you turn into dark halls and worst of all was entering the room. The sliding door handle to the balcony was dangling from the door. All the walls had scrapes and dents and to top it off I had to shower with sandals on because the bathroom had mold. it is a shame because the pool area was pretty decent but they should take some time during the day to give the pool some maintenance there were cups and food spilled in the pool that should have been attended too.", "offset": [484, 698], "date": "2015-05-15", "cpt": "0", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 2, "uid": "e8896352-8aa3-433c-ba5e-7667463d2cbe", "sentence": "Great Vacation. This hotel is great I would of rated it a 5 but the furniture in the rooms just need to be updated Hair dryer to be checked and replaced with new ones and the bathroom is beautiful with the exception that it should have air vents that blow to keep the bathroom mirrors from fogging even with the door open the glass still fogged up. The Staff were amazing and great customer service. My husband and I stayed in the ocean view room that was awesome could not complain at all. As with any other hotel everything was extremely pricey but that is to be expected at the hotels so make sure that you venture out and go to other places to eat and drink go to Walgrens In Old San Juan buy your liquor there or any Walgrens and bring it back to the hotel room. Yes you pay a cab ride but you will have something to drink for the rest of your stay so its worth the 15 bucks. or take a nice 30 minute walk as my husband did and cab ride home. I would definitely stay again. just hope they update the furniture and bathroom vents. Old San Juan is a 30 minute walk way and worth it or take a cab for about 15 bucks.

Several years ago another famous hotel brand learned that the 1 feature customers want from a hotel is a comfortable bed thus the Heavenly bed was born. Even though we paid an extra 12 night to be upgraded to a recently renovated room this Hilton hotel fails to recognize this priority. Bed was new but hard as a slab of granite. 5 nights of uncomfortable bed nearly ruined our visit. Good customer service at the front desk and the pool bar but it stopped there. Bartenders and servers at our groups reception were a bunch of grumpy old men. Some of the same negative attitude showed up at the lobby bar.

We enjoyed the quiet beach environment and had a great family fun time of the expansive multi tier pool with multiple polside and beach areas for lounging. Centerpiece among the pools is a moderate sized infinity pool overlooking the Atlantic Ocean. The atrium reception desk with fruit infused water along with the connected Caribar restaurant bar for drinks and light bites area accentuate attention to detail at the Caribe Hilton. It reopened after extensive remodeling in May 2019. I recommend Hilton gold status to cover cost of available daily breakfast at onsite restaurant Salitre del Caribe. Daily Pina Colada tasting offered from 1230 to 10 near the pool is also a small notable treat. Given the 40 daily resort fee I took a look at the gym but was not tempted enough to engage. I was impressed with a brief tour of the spa complete with ocean based spa decor and an aromatherapy scent that I wish I could take home. My eye starts to twitch and my hand shakes a bit when I think about 40 resort fees but held it together for my family. I recommend hilton points usage mandated sufficient to pay for the entire stay as a way to have the resort fees excluded. The spa is well designed and decorated.

Also the lady at the front desk managed to check us in around noon which was very nice of her. Having travelled around the world I would say the hotel pool is rather small for a hotel of this size. However the pool is literally steps from the beach and beach is better than pool so this was not the biggest flaw. For some reason the hotel does not like Ubers to come for pick up which we did not know so we had a small issue on the last day.
