Never acknowledging guests when they walk in they bury their heads at the desk they are super slow even reluctant to ask what they could help you with. When they respond to the guest it is devoid of helpful content. OK we can obtain most answers on the Internet thank goodness. So that is really the only downside and easily repaired. It is not really such a big deal that the hotel is alongside a large box store and shopping mall because they have managed to surround themselves with nice landscaping. It may come as an initial shock for guests arriving late that one must park your vehicle in the lot 2 stores over from the hotel. Heres why we give a mostly good score The rooms are comfortable clean and airy. We were very pleased with the ground level room facing the canal. The little porch and lounge chairs made for a perfect morning coffee ritual. Beds comfy but soft mattresses just on the verge of needing replacement. Surly housekeeping if you linger in the room so use your do not disturb knob signs and alert the front desk when you venture out so you return to a refreshed room. The pools are just for dunking no laps here fine for us and polside light dining was a good option though they close early evening and no room service.

Nothing It was a disappointment right from the start1. We checked into our room around 200 and the first thing that I did was to do an evaluation of the room. Sparcley decorated though it was the bathroom that put me off. The silicone line at the base of the stool and tile floor was so nasty yellow it looked as if it had not been cleaned in months. There are at least 4 cracked tiles along with some with the grout missing. I imediatly went to the front desk and complained that I needed this toilet cleaned. As I waited for maintenane or house cleaning my wifes key did not work so I called up the front desk and requested new keys. About 10 minutes later I was presented with new keys. I waited until 230 before going to bed still no maintenance or house cleaning. I went to the front desk the next day and asked why no one had stopped by to take care of my cleaning request. I was first told that no one was in the unit when they came. well I was there all night and I know this because I was there to get the new keys and even if I was not there they were authorized to enter and clean. Right after that comment lie I was told that my wife said that it was not necessary well there is another lie I am the one dealing with this issue not my wife. I requested that I wanted this cleaning issue taken care of before I came back tonight. It is now 210 I stopped by the front office to confirm that they had cleaned the nastly urine stained silocone and I was assured that it all cleaned. As I entered our room There sits a bottle of some type of pink solution or cleaner on the floor. The stained silicone has not been even touched and I know this by the hair that is still on the floor around the base of the stool and there is another lie. Nice2.

Valet guys hover around like vultures messed with my stereo moved the seat so far forward and up that I could not get in and would not listen when I said I would handle my bags which had fragile items in them. If you are forcing valet upon guests at least be considerate. 2. If you are staying in a first floor unit you may want ear plugs. People walking normally in the room above will echo through your room. Just hope that they do not come back at 3 am and walk around for 20 30 minutes getting ready for bed. 3. The walls are so thin that you can hear and feel the TV in the room next door. 4. The light on the patio outside the room is fairly bright and if you like sleeping in the dark you probably want to unscrew the bulb for the night. I called the front desk and they had no idea how to turn it off otherwise. 5. When we checked in the door to the patio was unlocked. it is a good thing we checked that before leaving for dinner or someone could have walked in and grabbed our stuff. 6.

They only offer valet and it \u2019s hard to communicate with some of the attendants others were very nice.

The location is far from town I think a shuttle is offered but we were never told of the schedule of location. Our two bedroom is split over 3 floors which is super strange. Not like the pictures showed at all. Be ready to climb stairs anytime you need anything from your room. The beds are very comfortable and they offer great products. The towels are super soft and they give your nice robes to use while you are there. Those are the shinny factor in an otherwise lack luster stay.
