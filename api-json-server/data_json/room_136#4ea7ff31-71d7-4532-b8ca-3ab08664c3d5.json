This hotel was recommended as the hotel to stay at for a conference held at George Mason University. The website indicated that they had shuttle buses that ran to the Vienna Metro stop and to GMU. I arrived at the metro stop at about 745 pm called and was told the shuttle was no longer running it stops at 8 pm. I pointed out that it was not 8 pm yet and was told the last run was at 715 and that I needed to call a taxi to get to the hotel 25 tip. When I got to the Hotel I asked about the shuttle to GMU and the people at the front desk said there was no shuttle to GMU I had need to call a taxi in the morning another 20 then find my own way back. For a hotel that advertises it is convenient to both Reagan Dulles with shuttles to the Metro and GMU I had disagree. My plans were to stay for the weekend and spend time in DC using the metro and the shuttle to get there from the hotel. Good idea if you believe the hotel information Bad idea in reality. If you are using your own car or a rental the hotel is close to highways and the room was fine although not cleaned well I stayed three nights and it was not vacuumed at least two of the days.", "offset": [1043, 1235], "date": "2015-06-29", "cpt": "0", "category": "room"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "abbb7c92-db4a-4771-a3a1-cb7b4c13b991", "sentence": "Fantastic Suites. I stayed here on several weekends in July and August 2015. On one of these stays I was upgraded to one of the Panorama Suites. About twice the size of the regular room and has floor to ceiling windows that curve all 180 degrees around the room. Very cool though you have all of those curtains to deal with at night. The regular rooms are fine as well. Each has a large LCD TV that swivels between the sleeping and living room areas. The living room has a couch which I assume makes into a bed though I did not try it. There is also a refrigerator and one of the in room coffee devices not a true coffee pot. One of the best things about this location is there is a Whole Foods a block away and a shopping center close by with plenty of food options. Plenty of free parking as well.

This is what you had expect from a Hyat clean modern and smart rooms. The room layout is a bit awkward with a divider in the middle separating a living area from the bed area. The rooms are not vast and I think I prefer a traditional room layout to maximise spaciousness. But the beds are as comfortable as usual there is a large TV and bedrooms are as nicely finished and clean as you had expect. In contrast the bathroom is a little small and extremely dark since the only light in the room is obscured by the shower curtain when you get in the shower. The lobby is bright and airy and the food that is available is fine. there is a nice event on each week with all inclusive food and beer which is nice for business travellers as it is an opportunity to chat to local people rather than just business meetings. there is a pretty patio for sitting outside and it is possible to walk to shops and restaurants nearby as well. it is a pretty solid choice and exactly what you had expect from a Hyat.

The hotel itself was very nice and very close to shopping and restaurants. We came down here for only a night when visiting a friend in the area. We also booked it on hotwire so we did not know the name until after we booked but once we did we were able to follow other readers recommendations like being up on a higher floor to prevent noise. They were also able to have a pack and play for our 2 year old in the room within a few minutes of us going up to the room. The room was a large size with a nice sitting areawhich is where the pack and play went and they also have a radio in the room which we moved from the bedroom area to the the sitting area so our little one could have something to help her sleep. The hotel was pretty busy and there were several events going on while we were there. We were able to enjoy the pool which does have pool toys which was a nice touch because most hotels I have been in never have had that. They also had a lifeguard on duty which is an added bonus for families. The bed was pretty standard not the most comfortable bed I have slept in but also not the worst. And for it being a Hyat I would have expected a little bit more. You could tell the rooms had some dating to them and may need some upgrading but that did not detract from the value. Unles you have a package that includes it breakfast is 15 dollars per person but there is mcdonalds and dunkin donuts right down the street that may be a better value. All in all I would stay there again but only after booking on a site like hotwire because I do not think it would be worth the full price value.", "offset": [378, 501], "date": "2015-10-01", "cpt": "0", "category": "room"}, {"id": 6, "uid": "5cdafc7c-5bdb-4e1a-a8cc-66d40be2c60a", "sentence": "Great value but below Hyat standards.

I stayed for two nights for a friends wedding. Her block of rooms were aprox. half off of the list price. I sure hope the list price was for the renovated rooms. Half off made this room very affordable even without considering it was 1 near DC and 2 the July 4th weekend. The hotel info says the renovation will be completed by fall 2016. The room I was in was a good size. It had a king bed a sitting area with a sofa mini fridge coffee machine and desk. The TV sat on a dresser that served as a half wall between the two spaces. There were huge windows in both the sitting and bed room areas. The bathroom was dark especially the shower. It was slippery the non slip texture stickers having worn off or been removed. The small underpowered light in the loo bath space is over the toilet and then an opaque shower curtain made the shower VERY dark. Dark slippery not a good combo. The sink is outside the dored space and offered a decent amount of counter but not a lot. There was a lighted magnifying mirror and iron in the room but I never found a hairdryer. which is odd. The bed was comfortable enough and I felt there was a sufficient variety of pillow styles. The AC was quiet but effective quiet is a great thing since many hotel AC units are just too loud. The sofa and other furniture pretty much needs the renovation it is all tired and worn out. I hope they are also replacing the wallpaper and the carpets. The location is great if you want to be in Fairfax lots of shopping and food nearby.

Some of the hallways were strong as well. So if you are traveling and are sensitive or someone you are traveling with is sensitive do not stay here until they can switch to some better more allergy friendly products. One front desk clerk tried to help me but he could not get the housekeeping staff to use the ozone machine on my room to dissipate the smell as another guest was able to get. She had said that helped her but it did not remove it completely. She just happened to be checking out as I was complaining about my room after the first night and told me she had the same issues so its not an isolated event.

NO GO. We pulled into this hotel what we thought was a very nice entrance at what should have been the front of the building discovered it was not. The main entrance is a small door around the back of the building. We came into a very attractive lobby area to a small front desk where we were treated very nicely by the staff. They were attentive tried to meet all of our requests. This was typical off our experience with all of the hotel staff with whom we came in contact. Unfortunately the rest of the hotel does not live up to the standard set by its management its staff. As said in the title to this review it is all show no go. Our room looked great. It had a desk a nice sitting area a separate bath sleeping area a large television. As I found out from the Operations Manager almost every room in the hotel is like that. Sounds great does not it. The problem is there are only a couple of tiny drawers a small hanging space in the bath area so if you are staying more than just one night you can not hang clothing or unpack a suitcase so all the nice seating area is taken up with luggage. The restaurant is part of the lobby. Very well designed. It looks great. Again it seem they have the same problem all show no go. It took us two a half hours to get luke warm burgers fries desert that did not come out the way it was ordered. This was a totally disapointing stay at what should have been a premier hotel.
