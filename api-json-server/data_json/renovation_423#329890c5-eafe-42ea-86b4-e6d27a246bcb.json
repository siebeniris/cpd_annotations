As a seasoned travelling family we have stayed at MANY hotels over the years and have yet to experience such a poor stay. Yes it is well located hence the price otherwise you are not getting what you pay for. The newly renovated lobby nice but deceiving. Our room had an unwelcoming stench which resembled damp mouldy air. A bra left behind from the previous guest found on the floor by the pull out sofa bed had me wondering what type of cleaning standards are acceptable here and who checks the rooms to ensure standards are met. We asked for a fourth bath towel as we are a family of four we waited nearly an hour and had to share towels as it never came and we had dinner reservations and had to leave. The sofa bed was not useable as it was thin with springs sticking out of it. The next morning we headed down to the Starbucks bistro and ordered breakfast waited 45 mins for a few eggs and French toast. Another guest noted how unimpressed they were considering housekeeping forgot to clean their room. Needless to say we were happy to check out and are disappointed that being part of the Mariot chain we did not get what we paid for unles what you really pay for is location as that is all that was beneficial. I have read you are undergoing renovations this year much needed perhaps after the fact it will be worth it at this point I just can not recommend.", "offset": [1238, 1385], "date": "2016-01-09", "cpt": "0", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "18e20057-6eb5-42f3-b883-d688884e3cda", "sentence": "Honeymoon.

I had an issue with my TV in the first room they gave me after attempting to fix it twice they moved me to another room. It was a little smaller than the original but not a deal breaker. Beds have definitely been upgraded since the last visit. They are way more comfortable and on brand with what you can expect from the brand itself. I was close to the laundry room or the housekeeping area so I had the luxury of hearing the machines start stop and buzzers. Great location.
