I had a business convention this weekend so I booked myself and my helper into the Westin. it is location in reference to the convention center is excelent it is attached and has a skywalk. The hotel is nicely appointed with an elegant design tasteful decor and many amenities including a pool exercise room lounges a steakhouse a Starbucks and a FedEx. There are dozens of restaurants within a four block radius and cheap parking in the lot behind the convention center loading dock as an option. The Oceanaire was an incredible upscale dining experience you should not miss. Check in should have been simple. Check in and check out were my problems with this stay. I was passed down the line to three different employees until they got me to one with the ability to take my cash payment which is tiresome and takes forever. Most of the time I prefer to pay cash and leave my credit card for incidentals. This particular hotel does not offer that option. You can not split the stay between payment options this is something I do all the time at other hotels including Hilton Branded Hotels. An ATM was pointed out to me if I wanted to use cash and then get my deposit back at check out. My card is not an ATM card I do not have that option. I ended up having to split my stay of three nights and then recheck in after two nights. This made my trip much more complicated and took them about half an hour to complete. I do not understand having to go to this much trouble. Security is high. You must have a keycard to work the elevator and it becomes a trial making sure you get it swiped and punch your floor in before it goes up for everyone else and you lose your turn in the elevator you called. The room was lovely though there is a long dark hallway in the room. We were assigned 1201 which was very clean with crisp fresh bedding excellent air conditioning an updated bathroom and a very small mini fridge but no microwave. The mini bar was empty. I did find that unusual. Why have one that is empty. The rain shower head was good and the beds were comfortable. We had breakfast at Shulas in the property which was excellent. The buffet was less expensive but our server recommended the cook to order which was great. Our server was fabulous and knowledgable about the area. We made a purchase at the FedEx store and the Starbucks. FedEx was very polite but our coffee from Starbucks was barely warm. Once again at our final check in Saturday we had another issue and it took about twenty minutes to get us booked for our final night. They had to locate a cash drawer and the manager helping me seemed exhausted as she had apparently been working since 11 pm and she had no change for my payment. She promised to make a note for check out that I was owed a refund in addition to my security deposit. On checking out no note was found in the system. They had to finally call her at home and verify my story. That took another 20 minutes. Why am I bringing this up. I spent over 140 a night plus taxes to stay at this Westin. I picked a luxury hotel with the intention of having an easy stay so I could relax even though I had to work 12 hour days. It was a good stay. I recommend it for others. But I did not feel welcomed and the manager I dealt with Saturday morning made it quite clear that she did not feel like dealing with the situation that someone else caused. She was miserable and let it affect our transaction. I was polite respectful and trying to do what I could to get to work. I apologized for taking up her time asked how she was etc. Upon check out it took so long I did not even have time to stop and get breakfast. I will be back at the Convention Center next year for another show. I think I will choose the Hyat or the Hampton Inn around the corner.", "offset": [1817, 1978], "date": "2016-05-01", "cpt": "0", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 6, "uid": "002e3ab1-b49c-40ec-8748-d0f21287133d", "sentence": "Clean and well maintained and in a convenient location.

First of all the lobby and second floor smells AMAZING. Seriously it makes you feel like you are in a spa. I want to buy whatever scent that is and put it all over my house. Second the check in desk was over staffed to prepare for the huge influx of people they were expecting to come in that day for the competition. I appreciated the noticeable increase in staff as we have been to several out of town competitions where we have had to wait upwards to an hour in line to check in. Not only was the check in desk well staffed they were very friendly as well. The hotel provided all guests with free internet for the weekend just for the competition which I thought was an awesome unexpected touch. We were provided a handicap room which was fine especially given the fact that we booked the room on another site for a heavily discounted rate so I was happy to just have a decent room. The shower head was loose and kept sliding down which sprayed water all over the floor. I say all that though to compliment the maintenance staff. When I called the very busy front desk they had someone up to the room for repairs in less than 10 minutes. We stepped out for dinner and came back to a perfectly working bathroom shower. The proximity to the convention center can not be beat the beds are the traditional Westin beds which sleep like a dream the pool fitness center and hot tub were great and the room service breakfast fast and delicious. My only complaint would be the elevator wait times. We had to wait a while for elevators that were not filled to capacity. We took the stairs one time up from the pool because we do not mind walking and were tired of waiting for the elevator but the stairs are locked to the floors apparently are for emergencies or outdoor access only so we ended up having to go back down to the ground level to get out of the stairwell walk outside in wet bathing suits hair in the freezing cold around to the front door. That was less than ideal but we did not make that mistake again and just waited for the elevator.", "offset": [1077, 1184], "date": "2020-02-04", "cpt": "1", "category": "renovation"}]}
