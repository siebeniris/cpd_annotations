Till You Stay There. Started with a long drive and a seemingly hurried check in. Got to my room with all my luggage and the key did not work so I had to go back down and have the key reset. Was impressed by the facilities lobby pool and work out room. Walked into my room and saw a huge sliding door and got excited until there was no way to open it it had rusted shut. And yes I had removed the security bar. Then I had left my bathmat down on the floor from my shower after my work out the night before and when i went to readjust it there were two large bugs under the mat. Left my toiletries case in the bathroom because I did not want to put it back in my suitcase. Then i went down to breakfast and was asked if I wanted the buffet or to order off a menu and I said the buffet was fine. Had an egg and a piece of toast with coffee and was presented with a bill for 1695. There was no signs indicating that they would charge that for a simple breakfast. I made it a point to check out and tell the clerk about my issues and was promised that they would add an extra 70 points to my Hilton Honors account and it is now a month later that did not happen either.

Recently had a return to this location. Knew that the refurbishments had been completed so was interested to see the changes from a year ago. Lobby area was the most noticeable transformation. Very bright and designed as a mixed use space with the restaurant flowing into lounge area immediately upon entrance via the sliding glass doors. A new bar is adjacent and was well attended. I thought the location of the bar was odd as it was very close at right angle to the Reception desk. Must be my age but was not a huge fan of this new layout. Just TOO open. sitting having a drink in the main travel path of the hotel is not appealing to me. Saw no noticeable changes to guest room entirely serviceable if uninspiringGreat to have the large 42 inch LG television thoughA bonus of this location is it is indoor and outdoor pool area. Very well maintained and pleasant. A new covered bar area adjacent to the outdoor pool promises to be a popular spot in the warm weather. There was a sparse offering of new polside furniture that while attractive was the MOST uncomfortable I have ever encounteredThe spread between seat back and leg knee bend is so far that it would only work for somebody VERY tall. somebody did not actually try these before purchase. lolTwo issues this tripUsed the on line check in via the Honors ap which I love. The process was not as fast as usual upon arrival and got a call afterwards saying my credit card had been declined. After a call to provider who assured me all was fine. they suggested that the expiration had been entered incorrectly. After having to return to reception this in fact WAS the case. Why. All my information should be on file with HonorsHandled politely. but who needs that hassle after a day of travelThere is a serious issue with sewer gas in the elevator shaft that makes use of the elevator practically unbearable.
