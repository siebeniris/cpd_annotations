The hotel was in an excellent location. Practically next door to empire state building. One block from 5th avenue. However the room was very small New York sized perhaps and there was no soundproofing from people in the hallways because the of the room doors and people were returning in the middle of the night most nights. The room temp was ok but the windows were so old that it was freezing near the window. And the room was small so the bed was near the window. Bed was great tho really comfortable.

I stayed here twice once in Sept 2014 when it was still finishing its renovations and once again in February 2015. I find it to be great value for money especially in a city like New York but also a curious little place that had not worked out all the kinks between stays that I would have expected. But I was surprised to see how reasonable the price is given how convenient it is to the subway and to several restaurants and late night eateries delis should you need those. One thing I LOVE about this hotel the available outlets. Way too many places hide the plugs behind the beds and you can not access them which means you have to charge your phone on the floor across the room. Or you have to unplug everything lamp phone clock to plug in your stuff. The Martha Washington smartly has outlets built into the nightstand. This is a HUGE convenience for anyone who uses their phone as an alarm as I do. The rooms can be small upgrade to the deluxe if you can at least and sometimes oddly laid out due to the constraints of the building. I randomly got wheelchair accessible rooms both times which meant I had a better closet situation a full armoire basically than my friend whose rectangular room had a lot of empty space but was very narrow and only had what looked like a small coat closet to use as a wardrobe. I think the building used to be one of those Residences for Ladies Only and some of the rooms show it. I had say at least once every two days only one of the elevators was working and whatever thing they put up on the lobby walls in September was already cracked and peeling by February. The staff was great. When my friend and I checked in Housekeeping was running way behind we arrived the same night they were having a Grand Opening event in the ballroom so our two rooms were not ready even though it was 8 pm Rather than have us wait even though we were prepared to the desk clerk who I think was named Sam upgraded us to deluxe king rooms and got us on our way. He was super gracious and helpful and way more worried about getting us ensconced in a room than we even were. The restaurant Marta is also always buzzing and had great food and cocktails. Reportedly they are putting in two more Dany Meyer places as well. The lobby area is already jumping just from the one so I am curious what more will do to the room prices andor the general noise level. Although the lobby was loud the room did stay quiet which was nice. The Internet is free which is GREAT. There are no vending areas in September there were but they have since been removed presumably because the restaurant opened. But that also means you can not get a late night water or soda if you are up working because eventually things close. Not knowing any of this we called down to ask about a vending area during an all nighter and the desk clerk was very apologetic but said she could rustle up a soda for me and sure enough BROUGHT IT UP HERSELF from their stash just to be helpful. The fullest of full marks for that. This may sound dumb but There was no hotel bathrobe either time. My friend remembers randomly getting one halfway through her stay in September but I never did if it was an oversight that is weird and if it was not. well it is weird either way. I understand that this is not a plush and posh kind of place but even a BAD hotel bathrobe is still the kind of worthwhile amenity that makes the guest feel comfortable. Especially because the towels are not bath sheets so wrapping one around you fresh out of the shower is not going to do much to warm you up or dry you off. Asking for a hotel bathrobe sounds like a total First World Problem and it actually is but also it is New York City your hotel ought to have SOMETHING even if it is thin as tissue. As for the location there is an AMAZING sandwich shop called Spreads at 30th and Park open only M F tragically. but WELL worth going to if you are there at the right time. Bread Butter at 29th and Park can serve your late night needs. And you are right near a bunch of cute eateries like Resto Blue Smoke Wine 30 etc. Subway is at 28th and Park really close.

This is a renovated and nice hotel close to Madison Park and Flatiron so an ideal location two blocks from subway for restaurants bars grand central and Empire State Building. While the rooms are typical NYC size small and you can hardly move around the room was renovated and had central air instead of those wall or window airco units. In addition the hotels hosts a popular Dany Mayer restaurant in the ground floor food overrated but nice people watching. The big downside is that the hotel does everything to make an additional buck I arrived in the hotel around 130am and while I appreciate check in time is later if front desk can see that somebody just travelled 28 hours I came from singapore. the person is staying for almost a full week AND the room is effectively ready it is flat out rude to charge 50 for an early check in. Even if it means you have to briefly prioritize another room you simply do not charge extra for that. In addition when checking out I was charged another 28 a day as a service charge which upon asking for more details on this turns out to be for the complimentary morning coffee and tea and the Internet. Although nowadays no hotel should charge for internet even if a hotel does it is still my choice to accept that charge or not but at the Redbury New York this is just added to your room with no questions asked. Finally apart from doormen bell captains personnel is unfriendly and not up to par for the price one pays.

I visit NYC more often than I would like only because my daughter lives there. I am becoming a bit of frequent flyer with different hotels in various locations. This review is for The Redbury New York. First it is easy to get lost in this big city and with so many tourists that frequent the city all year round I am not sure my review will help anyone at all but I do want to share my experience in this hotel from the summer of 2017The Redburys location is great. Located on E 29 st between Park and Madison. Tons of little eateries and long narrow restaurant bars NYC is known for. Walking is my chosen form of transport but I do recommend buying a 7 day Subway pass if you want to explore further north and south from here. The hotel is pretty central I would say for tourist standards. you are not quite in the noisy obnoxious area of Times Square but a 15 20 minute walk will get you there. it is actually pretty quiet at night and for me that s a plus. The hotel is unassuming because of the narrow entrance. 2 big glass doors welcome you in but not before you pass the restaurant Marta. Fancy restaurant that s a little bit much for me. It was always super busy which I suppose is a good thing. Value wise I can recommend others for a fraction of Martas prices. that is another story. 3 elevators that were pretty quick take you through 12 floors of this historical hotel. The red carpet and accents made me feel like I would encounter some paranormal activity but sadly no. ha. I chose a room with 2 double beds that was smaller than some of the ones I have stayed in but clean and comfortable hit the high marks. And really it is nice to have a big room but you are only really there to crash after a long day of exploring the city. Some rooms have a view of The Empire State building. Washrooms were modern and new as of summer of 2017. Pillows were big and fluffy. Air conditioning was great up until the one in our room conked out. July in NYC is not the best time to go if you do not like the heat. And you better make sure that you are staying in a place that has A C that are working well. Because we were on the top floor the A C up there was working extra hard. And for a few days it worked awesome but the 4th day of full blast all night it conked out. We called for service and they came up 5 times to try and fix it. Finally it was way too late to try and get it working. The maintenance guys tried their best to remedy the problem but to no avail. So we kept the doors open hoping the cool air from the hallways would make it into our room but that did little to nothing but a crap nights sleep. The next day I talked to a lady at the front desk who did not have much sympathy to how our stay was going. She repeatedly told me we would have to wait till 3 of the clock and wait and see if a room comes available. Luckily for our sake her partner that day Julio Nerma saved us from further frustrations. He knew our situation and was kind enough to hold a room of equal value. He also gave us a voucher for the continental breakfast they have in their small dining area. it is got quality products just not enough for 20. there is plenty of great value breakfast places nearby. I got to Andrews Coffee spot on 35th and 7th. A bit of a walk but well worth the it as far as breakfast goes. When we lugged our luggage back up to the 4th floor and entered our new room we were happily surprised that they had upgraded us to a deluxe suite. If you have a choice ask for room 408. Night and day difference in space and a few more lux add ons that we were pleasantly surprised with. Thank you Julio. Overall our experience was good. Definitely recommend staying here. You might find less expensive hotels but for the quality of service and cleanliness.
