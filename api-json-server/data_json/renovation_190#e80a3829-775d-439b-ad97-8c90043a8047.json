I recently stayed at the Crowne Plaza Downtown for a conference it has been about 4 years since I have stayed at this particular hotel. The changes that they have made in that time are wonderful. The staff offered top notch customer service from check in to assistance with our needs during our stay every single one of the staff members were friendly smiling courteous and above beyond helpful. Very clean hotel from the lobby to the fitness center and to our room I could not have asked for a better experience. I personally want to commend 3 staff members in particular. Tyla from Housekeeping John from Engineering and Nivea from the Front Desk. Tyla came to our aid at 10 pm on the first night due to a wet spot on our floor. She brought us towels contacted engineering to make sure there was not a leak. She was so friendly so bright cheerful at that time of night joy was emanating from her. She told us she had be back on shift the next day at 3 pm and would check on us. She kept her word. She brought John from Engineering that evening to double check on us. We appreciated both of them coming back to follow up and sharing their outgoing personalities. They were amazing. Nivea at the front desk was super friendly outgoing as well she was helpful took very good care of us including storing our bags after check out not once but twice. She went out of her way to make us feel welcome. well cared for. she is a gem to have welcoming your guests. I can not say enough about these 3 people along with the other staff I had the privilege of interacting with. This is going to be my choice hotel for my annual visits to KC I highly recommend it. Even with renovations going on which I did not even notice but which they made sure you were aware of offered amenities for I would suggest staying here it is only getting better. Well done Crowne Plaza KC Downtown. Thank you for treating me like a superstar.", "offset": [1679, 1858], "date": "2015-07-23", "cpt": "0", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 2, "uid": "6af68044-d034-476a-a6d4-82cb5ef3d4b6", "sentence": "Comfortable stay professional staff. This is an older hotel in the process of exterior renovations. Hotel staff was very clear about construction noise during the day which was not an issue for us. Smallish slightly dated room but comfortable. I was pleased that we were able to check in early without hassles. The only major issue was lack of onsite parking due to the ongoing construction. The hotel is within a very short walking distance of the KC Convention Center and has a fitness center and a small outdoor pool on the 7th floor. There is a Starbucks adjacent to the lobby as well as a bar which I did not visit. The staff was very professional and courteous were prompt in responding to needing extras for the room pillows and towels and quickly resolved a scheduling issue with our reservation.

As I entered the lobby of this hotel on a Sunday afternoon in July 2016 the first thing that struck me was that the carpeting was badly stained. That coupled with the fact that it is an older hotel and the lighting is dim left me feeling uncomfortable. Our group had signed a contract sight unseen for a 35 day meeting there so I could not have re located if i wanted too. In the end we got great service from the staff a good nights sleep in comfortable beds and a good location. but I could not get past the first impression. I was in a suite and feared that given how soiled the carpet appeared I did not dare chance sitting on the upholstered furniture in my room. I was told by hotel staff that they were planning a renovation in 2years and in the interim planned to do some deep carpet cleaning. If the carpeting were not so obviously soiled I would have given this property a pretty good rating despite it being a little dated.", "offset": [717, 849], "date": "2016-09-16", "cpt": "0", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 6, "uid": "139a7eef-e8db-443a-824b-033a721a3a4b", "sentence": "Great Service Great Views Great Location.

Odd number rooms have a much better distance sunset view. Even numbers look into the downtown buildings and the Power Light district. Take your pickFinaly the location has been great.

We arrived this past Sat afternoon for a rehearsal dinner and wedding weekend. We received our keys to our first room 2303 got up there opened the door and there was a standing ironing board. unmade bed and bathroom had not been cleaned. We went back down and were given keys to 2313. Got back upstairs and the keys were not working. Front desk came up with only 2 keys they worked and we arrived. This left us little time to get ready for the rehearsal dinner. On the way out we got our 3rd key. On the way home we decided to see the executive lounge and our keys did not work too late to fix so we went back to the front desk in the am to get the keys to work so we could use the executive lounge as we had concierge level rooms. We had breakfast and off we went for the day. At 330pm when we arrived back to our room housekeeping had never cleaned and made up the room so after notifying the front desk I asked for fresh towels and told them to make sure someone from housekeeping came up to clean the room at 5 pm when we left for the wedding waited 20 min and called again this time someone came with towels. I reiterated to the gentleman from housekeeping to clean the room when we have left around 5 pm. We came home from the wedding at 10 pm to an unmade uncleaned room. I called down to the front desk explained again what had happened and told them to have someone come up immediately to clean the room and make the beds waited 15 min and called again. this time she assured us someone was coming. We went down to the lobby and sat there til 1040pm when the rooms were ready for us. We had a 930am flight to catch today and had to be up at 615am. I have stayed in many hotels but this could have been a tv show it was so absurd. In my opinion the hallways and rooms smelled musty with alot of carpet stains and the rooms were in desperate need of refurbishment. I can not complain about the shower the water was hot with great pressure. The tub seemed to drain OK. We have never been to Kansas City but assure you we will try the Mariot the next time. We are IHG rewards members and were clearly disappointed in management. Staffing at the front desk and housekeeping.

We paid for an upgraded room 300 and it was small and in need of everything. Beds were uncomfortable. No fan in bathroom and very small. But no plugs for hairdryers etc. by mirror in hallway either. Discolored old grout in tub old carpet tub drain did not work. Room was overpriced in our opinion. The woman who performed our check out was unable to make eye contact and mumbled into her chest. Seemed uninterested in her job. Between check in person and check out person these were probably the worst 2 hotel desk people. Pros there is a nice lobby and easy parking.

Parking is too expensive at 29 per night so park across the way using the public parking structure for 8 per night. do not buy anything in the little snack bar near check in. They charge movie theater prices at 3 for a 25 oz bag potato chips 4 for cookies 225 for a small candy bar 3 for a bottle of water etc. The hotel restaurant called the City Bar is overpriced and offers small portions. I tastes like they reheat frozen meals. I could actually taste the freezer burn when I ate the ribs. The calamari was like eating rubber bands dipped in wasabi sauce.
