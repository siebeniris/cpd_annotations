These guys try hard with their service. You are often greeted with a warm somewhat large chocolate cookie on arrival and just as warm a smile. The location is terrific and if you get a room at the front million dollar views of Flinders Street Station the river Southbank and beyond. Our room was 901. Highly recommended. However that room was not large. Never mind. you will be out and about all day. it is not a beach resort hotel. When you come back to your room it will be recently renovated and homely. When we stayed the breakfast room was a little hovel on the first floor. The food was basic and to be honest I had pay the money and turn right a few meters down Flinders Street into Degraves Lane. There you will get a wonderful breakfast in an atmospheric little cafe with terrific coffee. Call it a part of your unique Melbourne experience as you fork out the cash.

This is a new renovation for doubletree Hilton. We booked through a Travelzo deal and had a king room with flinders at view. Rooms are big nicely renovated and good sized bathrooms which have been done up too. I had a couple of problems though the rooms facing flinders need double glazing it is really noisy outside. The biggest issue we had was that the hotel allowed renovation work to begin at 7 am. We were there to relax and have a one off sleep in but the hammering and banging started at 702 so no chance for this. I think anything after 9 would be suitable for a hotel to minimise impact on the guests. It was a poor reflection on the management to allow this. Whilst I understand it is under renovation still you are allowing people to spend money and have a mediocre experience. The other comment I have is that having plastic pipe on the shower is a cheap reflection on a good brand that doubletree should be and it means that the shower does not operate as well with the plastic pipe pushing the shower head to the side and knocking all the items off the shelf.", "offset": [709, 828], "date": "2015-01-17", "cpt": "0", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 3, "uid": "7277bf52-78b4-4a9c-8c45-309fa30d3594", "sentence": "Great location clean and modern rooms.

Spent the weekend in Melbourne from Sydney and stayed at the Doubletree Hilton as there was a great deal on Expedia. It had recently rebranded as the Doubletree since December I have been told and as a hilton honours member i thought i would try it out. The hotel is centrally located in Melbourne across from Flinder Street Station. Its very close to restaurants bars shops and a 10 15 min walk to the Crown Casino very accessible. The room we had was apparently one of the last to be renovated so the walls are paper thin you can hear the other occupants on the other side of the room Lvl 13. however I did raise this as an issue i was not hoping for much to be honest as I imagined the hotel would be at full capacity given it was the Australian Open Tennis Finals. But they really did their best to accommodate and moved us into a room where the acoustics were alot better. From speaking to the management and staff there it seems it was their busiest weekend since they opened in Dec 2014 and the staff really did their best to stay calm under pressure and accommodate peoples needs. On Saturday there was a scheduled IT upgrade and this cause chaos at reception however the staff all pulled together to ensure the processed people the computer system was down so they had to manually check people in and out. Unfortunately its one of those things that is an anomaly and all you can do is be appreciative we have all been there. They did also offer a complimentary drink to people inconvenienced by the dilemma but i take my hat off to all the staff on duty from reception to kitchen and house keeping who really worked together to ensure people were serviced in a satisfactory manner. They were all calm under pressure and responded very professionally. A shoutout to Sam samit and team for being so professional during the IT blackout they really did their best. There was a few power outages during the day unsure why but the staff were quick to come to the room and fix the main. The rooms were perfect I do not spend too much time in the room as its a place to sleep so i was mainly out and about and shopping and the location is great. The checkin was quick and check out quick aswel. Overall I had a very good experience here and the service and professionalism shined any of events that occurred the hotel really tried and went above and beyond to satisfy customer needs. The personalities and friendliness definitely stood out and made you feel part of the Hilton team. I will definitely come back if the rate is right. for leisure and mostly for business.

As the remodeling continues the lobby was disorganized and improperly staffed during the critical 10 to 1230 check in and check out period. Evidently the lack of assistance is driven by labor rules that require employee breaks. Why the needed employees can not take their break before or after that period of time is a question upper level management needs to address. The potential of cross training food service staff with check in duties could help reduce the eight to nine guest members in the check in and check out line. Be aware that a great percentage of the rooms face buildings on either side. The rooms in the front of the building x01 or x02 have wonderful views but are extremely noisy. The rear facility rooms have views of roof tops above a certain level. The lobby might become inviting after the remodel is completed but additional attention is needed to keep the common areas clean. The rugs in the three elevators remained dirty for the vast majority of time as well as the lobby floor. The dining area is rather small and selections could be improved. The rooms are newly furnished and clean. This is a conveniently located hotel and there are a significant number of wonderful restaurants in the area. Even though the front desk was inadequately staffed the personnel were professional and attempted to compensate for upper level management decision weaknesses. The disjointed housekeeping issues might be the result of outsourcing but additional clarification will be needed to confirm that fact. If you a Hilton client and would like to stay at a Hilton property the Hilton South Wharf might be slightly higher in price but well worth the price. It would be interesting to see if the current Double Tree management group lost the contract with the owner of the Hilton property that is now flying a different property brand. I will book at the Double Tree again only if the price difference is 150 to 200 per night difference.", "offset": [842, 971], "date": "2015-02-15", "cpt": "0", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 9, "uid": "5bfb0edb-803b-43dd-ac1f-76002e138813", "sentence": "Great staff saved the day. When we arrived at this hotel about 930 on a day in early February our first impressions were not favourable. We had not been told by our travel agent that the hotel had changed from a Citigate to a Doubletree by Hilton and was undergoing renovation. As our taxi arrived all we got was a view of white hoardings and the noise of drills. Our room was not ready and we were very tired having travelled overnight from Singapore. The receptionist suggested we upgrade at a reduced rate although the room would not be available for all the nights of our stay. We agreed and were given lovely room overlooking Flinders street station high enough to leave the noise of the street well behind. We were able as it turned out to keep the room for the 5 nights and were pleased with that as downgrading would not have been nice. I would not want to be in one of the smaller rooms with no view. The hotel is in a very central position in easy walking distance of most of Melbournes main attractions the river the Botanical gardens the laneways etc. Ideal for a short stay as we could often pop back to the hotel if we were tired. We only ate once in the hotel restaurant which is not very big and is situated in the lobby so is not very attractive. My husbands meal was awful and they were very apologetic and halved our bill. They also gave us a bottle of wine for our room. Te bar and breakfast areas are in the lobby too and are not pleasant places to stop not helped by the fact that the hotel was still being renovated so the lobby was like a building site. Even without this problem though they are not attractive areas. However the hotels position makes it ideal for a short stay and the staff are great putting themselves out to helpwe had a problem contacting our shuttle transfer and the concierge could not have been more helpful and attempting to make up for any shortfalls.

This is a lovely hotel it has been recently renovated and is very modern urban and fits in well with Melbourne. The beds were of course extremely comfortable and there the guest room was very quiet. our view was not excellent looking onto another building but we did not purchase the room type with a view which I imagine would be wonderful as those rooms look out over Flinders St Station. I am a Silver Honours member and was greeted as such. Check in was quick and relatively painles the Doubletree cookie was delicious as always however it was not warm minor issue however there was no extra bed set up and we had to call down to have it brought in. the extra bed was horribly uncomfortable and you could feel every spring maybe this is an imrpovement they could make in future. But this is not a huge issue as it is very rare I would need an extra bed. the location is the best thing about this hotel it is right across from the Flinders Street Station and is in easy walking distance to the Southbank Promenade Crown complex and anything else you might want. There is a tram about 200 m from the hotel which can take you around the city and up to the Queen Victoria markets for free as the city has recently brought in free tram zones which is wonderful. I did not feel that the service was exceptional but it was in no way bad. There is one staff member who is exceptional he is very friendly and welcoming and the kind of person you expect to encounter at DoubleTree. We did not get a chance to visit the bar or restaraunt but it looked like an excellent spot for a drink or two of an evening. Hopefully I will get to it next time.

Most of the rooms are small by usual Hilton standards. We had a Flinders Street Station view room which gave us a great view of the station unfortunately most of the station was covered in scaffolding due to the stations renewal. This is by no means the hotels fault but was disappointing nonetheless. We were also surprised we had not been offered a floor on a higher floor as my profile states. The noise issue is something I wish that had been dealt with when the hotel was refurbished. The windows do not block any street noise so all night we heard loud mufflers and motorbikes as well as sirens. This was disturbing to our sleep.
