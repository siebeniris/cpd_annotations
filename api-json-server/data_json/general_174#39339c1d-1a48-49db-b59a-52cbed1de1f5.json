Since the closing of our favorite place several years ago we had tried a couple of resourts and neither really fit our wants. Sans Souci did. Recommended by our travel agent we decided to try the resort despite the almost two hour ride from the airport. We used Dudleys Big Ship Tours and the driver was very nice and dependable. We also highly recommend Club Mobay for entry to and exit from Jamaica. That service eliminates much of the frustration of arriving and departing. Once at Sans Souci we were greeted with a smile and fast check in but no welcome drink. We were soon in our room in B Block. The views are fantastic. The room itself was nice yet the bathrooms could use some update. The faucets in the shower really did not honor a place for hot water although once found the hot water was plentiful. Our room was not serviced for two days but we did not fret over it. We just took our wet towels out to the housekeeping cart and left them and took a couple more. The food was always good especially breakfast. We used room service every morning for coffee on our porch. It was always delivered on time with a smile. Our favorite lunch place was Bela Vista the beach restaurant. Be sure to take advantage of the two reservation only dining opportunities and make your reservations upon your arrival. We waited until the day after our arrival and did not exactly get the times we wanted. The AN facilities and are just that. Security is provided and the section is very secluded and protected. It was very quiet not much interaction among guests while we were there. The pool is very large and the jacuzi was very warm.

We knew we would enjoy. Our travel agent gave us several properties to consider for a spring 15 vacation. We decided on Couples Sans Souci. We were blown away by the whole experience from the shuttle ride to the property to the way we were treated at check out. Everything was deserving of 5 stars. This is a couples adult resort. it is NOT a spring break place with lots a high energy activities going on 24 hours a day. If that is what you are looking for try another place. I am not going to bore you with all the features you can see on their website so I will just comment on the most outstanding events that we took advantage of. The STARLIGHT GALA that is held every Friday night got a B. It would get an A but they made too much noise tearing it down. It was worth it though. The BEACH NIGHT buffet on Tuesday was a solid AAt breakfast every morning at the Palazina we enjoyed excellent coffee fruit waffles omelets sausage bacon and bakery items. I could have stayed there all day. But the BEACH beckoned. We never really had a problem getting chairs although I wish these places could keep guests from just putting down a towel at 9AM in empty chairs and then showing up at 3PM to start using them. And NO we never did that. We were not as lucky getting chairs around the pools so most all our time outside was at the beach. And as they say around there No problem monWe shopped the gift shop got a couples massage did a LOT of walking most of it UP hill and my wife actually saw several small lizards without freaking outA few tips I would give any new travelers to Couples Sans Souci. Bring pool shoes and some variety of insect repellent WITH DET. The propertys lifeguards regularly clean up the beach because there is a LOT of seaweed in the swimming area and the biting bugs do come out at night. Finally USE CLUB MOBAY. Look it up if you have to. This one tip saved us at least an hour at customs when entering the countryAs I said in the title we did meet so many couples who had been there 2 5 even 10 times. that is the greatest testimony that anyone can give about a resort and if we are able to we will be backTheir website has package tours available including air. We were able to save several hundred dollars finding our own flights in and out. We did hear that they will be closed during the month of July 2015 for upgrades and renovations.

This this was our second visit to Couples San Souci and our 8th visit overall to a Couples Resort. Our previous visits have been to Couples Swept Away 4 times and Couples Negril 2 times. Take a peek back at those reviews if you are interested. I wo n\u2019t count a \u201c Trading Places \u201d visit to Couples Tower Island. We bailed after 2 hours and took a cab back to San Souci. Yup San Souci became our favorite Couples despite a few concerns we had prior to our departure. Those concerns included the number of stairs hurricane Dany the heat and humidity the current renovation etc. But not to worry about a thing every little thing was all right actually perfect for us. Before I continue with my review I highly recommend our \u201c GO TO \u201d travel agent Mitch Toren mitchtripguycom for some options. Mitch is the guy to contact for any of your vacation plans in the Caribbean. If there is a deal or low rate he will find it for you at top of the line resorts. Because of the renovation blocks A and B nearest to the beach were unavailable as well as the Palazina restaurant. Last year we were in D block D2 to be exact and were surprised when we ended up this time on the top floor of G block in G14. This was a big concern because it is difficult for us to go up and down the many stairways from the room to the restaurants to the beach and back again. But we took our time found a number of pathways that included inclines rather than stairs and since we only made the round trip to the beach once a day it worked out quite well. We noted that the rooms in G had been freshly painted the bath room immaculate. It appears that there was major work done across the entire resort. The view from G is incredible. It is a suite with large balcony. Lovely place for morning coffee or evening Champaign. Highly recommended. We are booked to return to San Souci in April 2016 and originally requested A or B but are definitely changing our request to GBecause of the renovation they had do shift restaurants around but that was no problem. We dined at the Palazina at least twice. Casanova twice room service once plus attending the Repeaters dinner and the Beach Party. Food excellent as usual. Service superb. If you are able explore the resort. Lots of hidden surprises and charms. If this is going to be your first visit take the tour they schedule at least two times a day. I do a bit of scuba diving and took advantage of the included diving twice this year. There is a wreck of a 150 ft minesweeper Kathrine deep canyons in the reefs plenty of coral fish and almost everything you would expect plus a highlight of a pod of three Dolphins that decided to check us out. I do believe a video of the Dolphins is already on YouTube search San Souci Dolphins. If you \u2019re not yet a scuba diver take advantage of the included Discovery Dive. The excellent dive crew will train you and take you out to one of the many reefs for a short \u201c Discovery \u201d dive. If you have looked at the couplescom web site or read other reviews of Couples San Souci you will have already learned there are two beaches. The main beach textile beach seems to start filling up between 9 and 10AM but never seems to be crowded. If fact the entire resort was n\u2019t crowded the year because of the 72 rooms in A and B were being renovated. We do n\u2019t go to the main beach it appears nice but we spend all of our time at the other beach called \u201c Sunset Beach \u201d SB in the \u201c Au Natural \u201d area. SB is a small but deep beach that also has a sizable pool Jacuzi bar and grill. Have Veronique or Tanisha make you a Bushwacker. The water this year was much better than last December. Very clear and not turbid from wave action except for the last day where we got some waves caused by Dany. The White River empties in to the Ocean at SB and you get some interesting effects from the mixing of fresh and salt water. I like to snorkel at SB and you can clearly see the less dense fresh water on top of the denser salt water and the refraction when they mix. Many choose to take the lounge chair cushion to use to float on the water. Lots of fun. CAUTION there are lots of rock and quite a few sea urchins so it is best to bring water shoes. Entertainment is excellent. Silver Birds Steel Drum Band is not to be missed. Edgar makes the best omelets of all of Couples Resort. So despite the stairway issue Couples San Souci became the favorite of all four Couples Resorts. That is not to say we do n\u2019t like and do n\u2019t recommend the other Couples except for Tower Island we were not too tipped over about them. Each Couples Resort has a different vibe and each Couples Resort offers something unique. But as you get older you get pickier and we are picking San Souci as our favorite. Read the reviews of the other Couples Resorts that I have written over the past four years and the reviews others have written. Your mileage may vary to each his own no problem. Bottom line. We are already booked to return to Couples San Souci in April 2016 and are thinking about booking August September 2016 as well. We also will be in Couples Swept Away in December 2015 and Couples Negril in January 2016.

This was our first visit to Jamaica and we can hardly wait to return to Couples San Souci. From the time you walk in to the Couples arrival lounge at Montego Bay Airport until you leave at the end of your visit you are treated to full on hospitality. The ride to the Resort takes just over an hour. Check in is efficient and friendly. Our accommodations were in the recently renovated A building. Our apartment was perfectly clean well stocked professionally attended and very comfortable. The pool was nearby as was the swim up bar. Both were outstanding in every way and never crowded. The food and the service stand out as the most impressive aspects of our stay at Couples San Souci. Every meal whether from the beach side restaurant the buffet where we had breakfast and lunch daily or Casanovas for the evening was exquisite fresh beautifully presented. I would return to San Souci just to experience the food alone. But there is more. Every person we came in contact with displayed the utmost in courtesy and a commitment to serve their customer. From the reception desk to watersports check in on the beach to the guys who ran the ski boat and the staff who saw that we had a formally set table for breakfast and the server who poured the wine at dinner. Even the housekeeping folks engaged us in smiling conversation. we have travelled throughout the Caribbean since the mid 1980s so I believe our expectations are pretty realistic.

Whenever I spend more than 4 days at a resort I try and give the good and bad of what I saw and experienced from a perspective of what I would have liked to know about it. Although I have been to Jamaica 7 times always to the Negril areas Couples San Souci is a first visit for us. The resort is a drive about 1 \u00be hours from Montego Bay. There is no need to get a private taxi \u2013 the resort does a great job at arranging a bus and it gives everyone a chance to chat on route and meet some of the folks that are headed there as well. I also appreciated the Couples Resorts lounge area at the airport which is the gathering point when you arrive. The grounds of San Souci are spectacular 35 acres well kept and lush with foliage and trees on the slopes overlooking the ocean. I thought the garden tour with the gardener was a nice touch to offer guests. The resort consists of an older section with lots of character with the original buildings perched higher up on the slopes and then newer sections that have been built more recently closer to the beaches. The newer sections AB are where the main beach is located \u2013 I did not get to go into any of the rooms but from what I was able to see they are very nicely done and the folks that I met were very happy with them. We were in the older section G on the far end with a room on the top floor and a magnificent view. The room was spacious as was the balcony but also close to the entertainment at the pool so nights were not quiet while the entertainment was on we liked that and could sit there and listen however for those looking for solitude from 9 11 pm it may not be a good fit. The down side was the low water pressure at high demand times and barely warm water which at times was barely enough to wash off with. We were OK with putting up with that at times for the view. We got a chance to see some rooms in the other sections D which were also older and not as large. I had read reviews and knew about the stairs and the reviews are correct \u2013 The older section has a lot of stairs \u2013 not the case for the newer area. There are stairs to get to the rooms regardless of what section you are in however the older area has plenty of them to navigate or a road that can be taken to get there. Guests have the option of taking a bicycle or a shuttle if they want to avoid walking as well. We liked the stairs \u2013 with all the food and drinks we needed to make sure we got some exercise in one way or another however if you have bad knees or a medical problem you may want to be sure you are in the A or B sections. There are two beaches \u2013 one au natural that is very private and has its own pool bar and good grill. There is plenty of room. I found this to be one of the best resort Au Natural beaches that I have seen on my travels. The folks I spoke with tell me it \u2019s the best of the Couples resorts as well which explained why so many guests were there as they obviously choose this resort for that feature. I also appreciated the rules that that it was not clothing optional eliminating anyone not wanting to be part of the au natural experience from being there. The clothing beach was very spacious and also well attended the water activities were plentiful including scuba snorkeling glass bottomed boat and sailing. I thought the morning snorkeling should be a little later at 10 am which gives a leisurely time to eat breakfast first but it was good for those who wanted to get out early. The afternoon one was at 30 pm. There is a great mineral pool and hot tubs scattered throughout the resort at all beaches. Their spa offers a variety of options and we took the reflexology but cancelled the massages. Their health and fitness areas offer the usual classes and it was nice to see they also had Yoga and meditation. The resort has 3 restaurants \u2013 it pays to make reservations for the week as soon as you know if you want to get a time slot that you want if dining outside. They have 3 sittings and are very accommodating. We loved the Casanova in the old section the most. The martini bar is excellent and a great way to start the night before dinner. Food at all three was very good to excellent particularly the steak lamb and seafood dishes. We had room service one night and found the selection to be somewhat limited and quality to be very good. Breakfast is in one area each morning and the beaches have their own grill and bar areas to eat and enjoy during the day. Entertainment at night was good and the house band was particularly good. On one night they had a beach party with a DJ. There are a variety of performers who front the band throughout the week and two nights where the entire resort gets together in one area for an outside dinner with food stations and entertainment. They have a late night piano bar. The Weather end of Jan beginning Feb is different than Negril. A lot more rain came through but that did not change the vacation feel too much as it tended to pass through in hours followed by the sun again. The staff at this resort exemplify the joy of coming to Jamaica \u2013 friendly and accommodating they will go out of their way to make your stay enjoyable. There are numerous trips offered outside the resort but we did not make use of them. It was nice to see many of them were complimentary. Every resort has areas where it can be improved and I freely admit that some of this is my preference. I thought the lack of top shelf drinks was an aspect they missed on \u2013. Their drinks good but having been to all inclusive resorts that offer top shelf at least for dinner or at the piano bar is an aspect that sets them apart. The resort could also use a place for couples to dance. The performers were there to put on a show and on occasion there was an opportunity get up and dance with them and the band but it was not a dancing oriented show and having a disco or dance place to spend the night dancing would be good. Unfortunately the reflexology was not really reflexology \u2013 more a foot rub while seated in a chair too high for the feet to reach anywhere in a common area where guests wander through taking pictures and at some point one group on a tour of the facilities. I think the food service is well paced for the 630 and 730 seating \u2019s at the restaurants given the next group would arrive but the Casanova 830 seating was always very slow \u2013 took almost 2 hours to have dinner each time which dragged. My biggest gripe \u2013. the management seems to think it appropriate to close the Au Natural Beach when they want to play favorites to a wedding ceremony. Not good \u2013 In our case 100 paying guests are asked to pack up and leave and when we looked eight or so chairs were set up for wedding vows to be renewed on the beach. Not that it matters how many guests are there for a wedding I get that the Au Natural beach is a great place to renew vows \u2026 as is the other beach and the excellent wedding facilities and gazebos that have been established for that purpose. It is just wrong to charge guests to stay which includes the use the beach and then throw them out so you can charge couples to use it for other reasons at the same time. The majority of beach goers were at that beach and usually are from what I was told If a bride does not like what you have to offer in your facilities it \u2019s not an alternative to tell your guests to leave the beach. I would return \u2013 we met great people and had a great time at this resort. It is a 35 Star resort that hits a 4 star because of their staff. Well worth a visit or two \u2026 or as some folks there told us \u2026 a lot more.", "offset": [4850, 4912], "date": "2016-02-08", "cpt": "0", "category": "general"}, {"id": 7, "uid": "867b12f6-78e6-454d-9d95-9da1b09725ba", "sentence": "Beautiful grounds and large comfortable suite.

Being on a corner the views from our balcony were wonderful one of the pools the sea and right across another bay with the sunset. We were in F6. The only drawback to this position was that the evening musical entertainment was right under our room and if one wanted to quietly read or watch TV there was a lot of noise going on until 11 pm. However we could watch the entertainment from the elevated position of our balcony. The other thing is that it was quite a walk from the main beach and where breakfast was held. This did not bother us. All the steps with exotic plants either side were gorgeous. Not for the infirm though. it is worth finding the lake as the turtles and pelicans were fascinating and one can borrow a bike to cycle round the lake or you can walk as it is about one third of a mile round.

I would add that the fashion conscious might consider the d\u00e9cor a bit dated and due for remodeling a question of personal priorities. Food was never less than good much of it was excellent most nights I dined on steak or lobster. The patisier had a deft touch and desserts were consistently excellent. A constructive criticism bread and coffee were both in the American style to this European an espresso machine somewhere on site and some crusty not sweet bread available would both have been very welcome. The house wines were adequate a connoisseur might prefer something more up market the Caribbean is probably not the destination for the dedicated wine buff. The resort is set on a beach at the head of a small bay with gardens and accommodation perched on terraces up the side of a cliff. As others have written this does mean lots of stairs I walk with a stick but managed OK. The plus side of this is views from most rooms and privacy mature trees and clever design mean that no one is overlooked. The resort only has 155 rooms and the atmosphere is more quietly relaxed than many all inclusives average age maybe closer to 50 than 30 and no groups of mid afternoon drunks.

This is a VERY late review of our wonderful visit last May 28June 6. After much research we decided on CSS to celebrate our 25th wedding Anniversary. Our decision was based largely on what we hoped would be the intimate feel of this small resort. We liked the idea of a secluded beach without access to vendors and lots of people. We were looking for beautiful quiet relaxing secluded and romantic. What we found upon arrival was all of that and so much moreStafI have to start with the wonderful staff because they were our first impression of our beautiful home away from home. that is how they greet you. With a beautiful genuine smile and a welcome home. We did not encounter a single unkind or unprofessional person our entire stay. We were upgraded on our arrival to a room with a beautiful outdoor seating area which came with a breathtaking ocean view but it was not what we had in mind. We had booked a beachfront one bedroom because we wanted to be close to the beach and grill. We were almost embarrassed to go back to check in and thank Them for the upgrade but ask to be taken to our original room category. They were more than happy to make that happen for us the next day. This kind of attitude continued with every encounter throughout our stay. Love EVERYONE there. RomsUnderstand that the feel of this resort is not opulence. If that is what you are looking for you will disappointed. Our first room was pretty dated feeling but the ocean and he charm of overlooking the martini bar and mineral pool will make you forget that. Our beachfront one bedroom was clean and charming. We loved everything about it. It also had a balcony. Not a huge one but big enough for a small table and 2 chairs. Big enough to stand against the rail and gaze over the morning calm or the staff members preparing for the gala. Wonderful. Since our visit these rooms have been completely re done. I can not wait to return someday to try them out. The restaurantsBela Vista was our favorite. Its just charming to sit at the base of big tree all lit up in twinkle lights with the lapping ocean steps away. Food was delicious always try the soup and service was with a smile. At lunch this restaurant serves burgers snapper sandwiches etc. Yummy. After hours you can stroll by and order some late night fries or pizza. Awesome. This restaurant is right next to the beach bar. Palazina This is where You will enjoy breakfast with lots ok fresh fruit eggs bacon cheeses coffee juice smoothies breads chocolate croissant. Do it. Be sure to visit Edgar for the best omelette. Order an Edgar special if you like a little spice. You will need a reservation for This restaurant if you want to dine during prime hours. We are late eaters so once or twice we were able to just drop in a little later and be seated. Delicious choices pasta bar yummy desserts. CasanovaMen will need slacks for his one. Charming 5star dining. Plan for 2 hours and many courses. We only had dinner here once. It was delicious but we preferred Bela Vista. A word to the wise do not be in a hurry. you are on vacation. Relax breathe enjoy Jamaican timeGroundsThere are a LOT of stairs. Do NOT I repeat do NOT book this resort if you will be bothered by this. We personally loved the stairs through the beautiful trees and plants down hidden pathways past secluded hammocks. Walk explore enjoy. If you want to experience the beauty of San Souci and stairs are a challenge they will send a vehicle for you but you must be patient. Pools. BeachThere are 3 pools and a beach on one side of the resort and a pool and beach on the Au Natural side of the resort. do not let that scare you away if it is not for you. it is not that type of resort. A large percentage of the folks that come to San Souci do enjoy the Au Natural beach which leaves lots of loungers open at the main beach and polsMineral PolFabulous for a late night dip. Beautiful and quiet there is a hidden hot tub nearby. There is a smoothie bar here during the day that also serves sweet potato chips and dip to die for. You must also visit the mineral grotto and spa nearbyMain pool with swim up bar. Always plenty of loungers and easy access to something cold and fruity. Fun to play some lively pool volleyball.

We also took the free excursion to Duns River Falls. This is a must do once but try to schedule on a day when there are no cruise ships in port. Crazy numbers of peopleMostly we let sand gravity take over. We never got in a hurry to go anywhere or to do anything. We relaxed and enjoyed each others company and did not worry about a thing.

The food for the most part was good for meat eaters although as a vegetarian it was not great some of the selections were not very appetizing. The Gala and Beach Party not held on the beach are pretty similar lots of buffet food an lots of greedy people. Last time the beach party finished on Sunset Beach but this time people who were still there were moved to the main beach bar When the entertainment stopped a DJ in the beach bar Bela Vista area got going. They played mainly Jamaican music and barely any resort guests paricipated a few hung out in the bar. What did happen was the dance floor filled with off duty staff who of course loved the music and had a good time dancing drinking and making a lot of noise which thankfully ended at 11 pm. I must say that it is the first time I have been on a resort that allowed the staff to drink dance and party in the resort entertainment area. It was fun to watch them although the dancing got provocatie at times. if this had been a bar in Ocho Rios we had stumbled across it would have been fine but if anything the guests chose not to stay and went back to their rooms. It somehow did not really seem very appropriate. The rooms are slowly being renovate our Penthouse Suite had not been updated yet. It was spacious and had great air conditioning. The service at San Souci is great a lot of the staff though are in training and are still learning what fine dining service should be. The biggest disappointment here is the main beach in front of the restaurant and blocks A and B. Since out last visit the top layer of soft sand has disappeared and it now is a rock solid compact beach that you do not even leave footprints in. It resmbles that of a sandy construction site. The Sunset Beach was better at least it had soft sand on. There is also a lot of sea weed that is growning in the water and also washes up on shore the staff were not always very fast at clearing it up and it stank if it sat there very long. Not a pleasant experience. I do not think the people who go to the Au Natural Sunset Beach even know what this beach is like. I would not go back here with it like this there are so many other beautiful beaches in the Caribbean to choose from and this is a deciding factor. I had love to know what happened to it to change it so muchSan Souci though is a lovely resort the mineral pool is great and so is the new addition of the Martini bar. The entertainment was OK bit cheesy at times but that is what you get in all inclusives. If you want to be on a resort with clothing optional on offer you will probably love it it seems that 23 of the guests are there for that and they appear to be quite a clicky crowd. If you want to have unlimited food and drink freedom to be naked with a colonial feel this is for you. If you want a pristine white sand beach and clear water free of sea grass while keeping your clothes on this Is NOT for you. Overall a great visit but will not be back because of the beach and water quality. Our last trip was at Xmas to Peter Island in the British Virgin Islands a very up market experience with superb beaches so we have high expectations to fill and our beach experience here fell short of that.", "offset": [2919, 3086], "date": "2016-09-15", "cpt": "1", "category": "general"}, {"id": 12, "uid": "120076dd-1c0b-470b-8b6f-b7d377ea6843", "sentence": "Honeymoon.

Winter Vacation 2017. Well no Sandals again this year as they remain overpriced. At the recommendation of our wonderful Travel Agent Ornela Storey from Carlson Wagonlit Travel in Burlington Ontario we did the Couples Sans Souci in Ocho Rios Jamaica. After the process of elimination we were booked at the Couples Sans Souci in Ocho Rios Jamaica. After last year \u2019s great experience we flew Air Transat again and were not disappointed. Since Air Canada Vacations no longer uses mainline service you are stuck with Rouge so again on the advice of our agent we made the change and were pleasantly surprised from start to finish. We will be requesting Air Transat from now on. At the Couples Sans Souci in Ocho Rios Jamaica we selected an Ocean view one bed room suite. We were advised that the area we were in had lots of stairs which we found difficult at first but by the end of our two weeks we built up great leg muscles without going to the gym. We read a few reviews from people who were disappointed with the stairs and I say shame on your travel agent. Did not use one shame on you. This particular property has 2 beaches one is located in the lower section of the resort in front of the beach front rooms and the other Sun Set Beach which is clothing optional with all the facilities. Being a couples only resort no kids was again refreshing. 150 rooms with two beaches means you can always find a chair at the beach or by the pool. Most times during our two week stay we felt that we were the only ones there and the resort was at capacity. This was the feeling of a lot of the couples we talked to. The grounds are well kept and safe for the most part and lighting on the many stairs at night is an issue and the little flashlight we brought was used at night. Three pools one over at the sunset beach and two on the other side one being a swim up bar. Bryan the bar tender at this bar is the best I have seen. His talents should be at Vegas. Both as a mixologist and entertainer. The other pool is the \u201c mineral \u201d pool that uses tested mineral water from the nearby mineral spring. Water Aerobics is held in this pool which was very enjoyable however one must be careful as the pool bottom is very slippery. Three restaurants plus a bar grill over at the sun set beach. The fine dining restaurant is the Casanova with a top notch chef and menu for dinner only each night except Tuesday and Fridays where dining is on the front lawn as a beach party on the Tuesday and Gala night on Friday. Room service is also a fine choice and found to be speedy. The Palazina Italian is a lunch buffet and dinner choice not so formal as the Casanova but has a full service dinner menu and your only other choice on Tuesday if the beach party is not your thing but book early as it books up fast. The Belevista Beach Bar and Grill is a great lunch choice with the best burgers and soup the islands have to offer. We found that the dinner menu was more challenging for this location as most of the food seemed to be done off site and was either cold or dried out. All in all this is one of our favorite food resorts with the best soups in the Islands. One issue we found is this is a resort that does not ask about food allergies so if coming the onus is on you. We found peanuts in the salad where normally you would not expect them. The rooms were split into two major sections where the difference was Ocean view is high up and takes stairs to get anywhere and beach front were at beach level. The Ocean front seemed to be larger rooms with huge balconies. A tour of the Beach front rooms shows that most if not all rooms have been tastefully renovated. The Ocean view rooms where we stayed was clean but very tired. The motel style tub and shower and single vanity made for difficult morning and dinner preparations. Paint can only cover so much and it is due time for some renovations in this block. The rooms are well stocked with daily mini bar restocking and can be customized to your tastes. Standard water sports are available with a 6 day twice per day SCUBA. In the two weeks we were there we never saw a shortage of water sports equipment and the staff are second to none in helping and teaching you. Overall we really enjoyed our vacation this year and can say that this resort is far superior to many of the Sandals locations of equal room and service level and all at half the price. An update to the rooms in the Ocean view area would make a huge difference and hasten our return to this wonderful resort. Thanks again to our wonderful Travel Agent Ornela Storey from Carlson Wagonlit Travel in Burlington Ontario for yet another skillfully planned vacation and looking forward to winter vacation 2018.", "offset": [3919, 4014], "date": "2017-02-16", "cpt": "1", "category": "general"}, {"id": 14, "uid": "959cd63f-b709-48c9-ae02-5c5ca570d1d8", "sentence": "5th visit and not so good. We love Sans Souci and everything about the resort and this was our 5th visit 8 in total to Couples. We flew into Kingston with BA and the transfer was much less than from MoBay using the toll road a big plus after a 105 hour flight. The scenery on the way back to Kingston was stunning going though the Blue Mountains and reinforced why we love the island. The staff as always can not do enough for you but sadly on this occasion we found the service lacking with a heavy reliance on work experience trainees. For example on the Jamaica party night and Starlight gala night there were two members of staff serving wine and a number of tables went without any drink service for the whole evening us included. Belle Vista is a favourite of ours but due to the new chairs which admittedly look very pretty we could not eat there. When we mentioned it to Sunshine she agreed and said they had received so many complaints as the chairs were more suitable for sitting on to enjoy a drink rather than eating. you need 6 ft arms to reach the table and if you wish any more than about 13stone the back of the chair reclines so much your bottom is nearly on the floor. The lovely awning over the eating area has been removed leaving just the metal poles not attractive. Sunshine and Courtney as ever gave us excellent service. Casanova we ate there on a number of occasions and the food was lovely but for those guests who are there for more than a week. rotating two menus is a bit monotonous. Service on the first night we ate there 23rd Feb. was atrociously slow but our waitress Melesia was very attentive and apologetic over the course of the meal. Palazina good choice of food. service in the morning was slow and replenishing the buffet items was also lacking. Edgars omelettes were as always delicious and how he managed to juggle the huge queues for eggs is beyond me. The restaurant was refurbished in 2015 the chairs are coming apart the green painted bench outside is covered in food stains with the paint rubbing off the floor was dirty inside and the floor around the buffet station was quite frankly in need of ripping up and replacing. I also object to eating my meal in a restaurant accompanied by a peacock that thinks it has been invited to join us I work in a hospital ever heard of infection controlStarlight gala and Jamaica night personally we do not like eating by torchlight or sitting on hard plastic chairs on a wonky lawn. The food was average and for those guests who are there for more than a week please consider opening Palazina on a Friday night as you do on the Jamaica party night. Room service Mini bar excellent but on a number of occasions you would walk past room service trays that had obviously been left outside for some time as they were covered in ants which then in turn were all over the walkway. Even the family of cats that live on the property would not go near the trays so that shows you how long they were probably waiting to be collected. Housekeeping we stayed in A block and were given the same room as the year before which was much appreciated as we loved the location. Now the rooms were only refurbished in 2015 and already show signs of wear and tear and general lack of maintenance. One of the sinks did not drain away the shower drain appeared to be blocked I ended up throwing hot water from the coffee machine down it in an attempt to clear it which worked to some extent. There had clearly been a leak in the bathroom with paint peeling off the wall the covers on the ottoman in the bedroom was stained and the paintwork was either chipped had not been finished off properly. Sandy kept the room immaculately clean was always cheerful and nothing was too much trouble. Sunset beach excellent bar service and well maintained but is not it time you changed the sun beds and floats. The beds were broken and the floats were all cracked and showing signs of age. We did not use the main beach or water sports so can not comment. Guest services reception bell boys excellent level of service in particular Alicia Vanessa and Mario. Bars excellent choice of drinks and service particularly Tanisha Devon Bryan Quesiean Veronique and Jheanel. Entertainment a bit boring need to think of other types of entertainment rather than just singer bands who insist on trying to reach the top of the decibel scale. Milton in the entertainment team is brilliant fun and so good at his job. Photo shop did not use it this time. Would we go back. To be honest even though we won a free night stay at the Repeat guest dinner we are not sure. If we went back it would be because of all the staff members we have got to know over the years. For all of the comments above CSS is very expensive for the standard of service and amenities we received on this occasion. You may ask what makes me qualified to make such observations. I have worked in hotels for a significant part of my career. I know what to look for and the service I would expect to receive for the rating of the hotel. My husband hit the nail on the head whilst we were waiting to go to the airport the previous Operations Manager has left and the difference is noticeable it is not as slick as before standards have clearly dropped and we never once saw the new Operations Manager other than at repeaters dinner around the property. This review will probably upset some of the regular users of the Couples message board but as Couples do not respond to the message board comments I hope they will take some notice of this review as they rely on their repeat guests.", "offset": [1288, 1344], "date": "2017-03-05", "cpt": "1", "category": "general"}, {"id": 15, "uid": "524515e5-ce47-416e-9ca2-d4317c31c86a", "sentence": "The Perfect Week. My husband and I spent a week at Sans Souci 66 61317 for our ten year anniversary. This was the most perfect and relaxing week imaginable. I read hundreds of reviews before arriving and want to return the favor now. ARIVALWe used Club Mobay to get fast tracked through customs. Even though it was a Tuesday the customs line started to fill up quickly so we \u2019re very happy that we chose to use Club Mobay. It took only minutes to get through customs and get our bags. We checked into the Couples lounge handed our bags over and then got some rum punch and a snack in Club Mobay \u2019s arrival lounge. We then loaded onto our van with two other couples and headed for the resort. The drive took about 2 hours even with a wreck on the highway that delayed us a bit. Other than the delay the drive was smooth and scenic. The road is vastly improved since the last time we were in Jamaica in 207After the road delay and a flight delay we checked into Sans Souci pretty late in the evening. We received our welcome glass of champagne and went through the fast check in process. The front desk staff was very helpful. ROMSWe booked a one bedroom ocean suite mostly because we wanted the scenic views and large balcony overlooking the ocean. We were initially given room D10 which was a lovely room but had a very small balcony with a lush tropical view. The ocean could be seen from the corner but the balcony was barely large enough for a small table and 2 chairs. The rest of the room was lovely and included a separate sitting area with a couch a huge walk in shower with a lovely window and view and a double vanity. After much hesitation I decided to ask if we could be moved since the balcony and view were so important to us. An alternative room was not available that night but Tevin at the front desk was very helpful and said he \u2019d put us down for a room change the next morning and asked for our block preference. We asked for the G block. Our night in D10 was peaceful and quiet and we slept well. The bed was comfortable and the Air Conditioning was lovely. We also received a bottle of sparkling wine and a fruit plate for our 10 year anniversary celebration which we had informed the resort about prior to arrival. Our mini bar selections were also present on the first night which was a pleasant surprise. The next day we checked back with the front desk. Keryan was working and had already known to expect us and took great care of us. At around noon that day we were able to move to room G18. The room was perfect. The balcony was very large just like the pictures on the website for this room category. It included a double lounger and a table and chairs and still had plenty of room. The balcony was completely private from our neighbors with a full concrete divider between them. The view was breathtaking. A lovely view of the ocean was below us and the lush trees and a glimpse of the mineral pool gave us the perfect view. The living room in G18 was huge and included a full couch two sitting chairs a flat screen tv the mini bar and another set of table and chairs to eat at. The bedroom was completely separate with its own door. The bathroom was significantly smaller with a single sink and tub shower combo. We were happy to have the smaller bathroom in exchange for the rest of the perks of the room. Our luggage was brought to the room later that day and our mini bar was re stocked with our preferences. We always had hot water and good water pressure and our air conditioning worked well to keep the room cool in the hot June weather. There were a couple of small notes to make regarding the room that are n\u2019t really complaints just things to be aware of\u2022. As everyone has said there are a lot of stairs at the resort. G block is right at the top of the resort so getting to from meals events pools and the beach is a trek. My husband and I are fit and work out 5 days a week and we got a bit tired the first couple days before adjusting to the climb. It was particularly hard if you forgot something up in your room and had to go back. By day 3 we were used to it and agreed we \u2019d do it again to get those G block views\u2022. On the nights where the main lawn featured entertainment Tuesdays Fridays and Mondays our room was extremely quiet and peaceful. Our new friends in B block said those nights were a bit noisy for them until about midnight as the events wrapped up and the area was cleaned up. The other nights of the week the nightly entertainment occurs at the lobby pool and Balloon Bar in the form of live music. The music was nice but be advised that you can easily hear it up in G block until around 11 PM every night. Since this is vacation and we \u2019d probably stay up that late anyway it did n\u2019t bother us too much but it was surprising how much the sound carried. \u2022. After the first night we were never able to successfully request items for our mini bar. It was refilled daily with water and red stripe and we had our originally requested rum and vodka but were n\u2019t able to request refills on juice or get bottles of wine or champagne refilled. We asked a few times about how to do this and told staff that cards to hang on the door and request service were missing from our room. We never did get the cards but managed to politely ask for a bottle or two at various bars to bring up to the room as needed. It seemed that this was an inconvenience for those bars but we had no other choice\u2022 Guests are permitted to smoke on balconies so even though our balcony was completely private we did have a few nights were neighbors \u2019 smoking was noticeable\u2022. The balconies get hot during the afternoon and evening. We loved watching the sunset from the balcony and having breakfast and evening drinks out there but during the day it \u2019s scorching and it \u2019s a good idea to shut the curtains to help your AC keep up with the thermostat. BEACHES POLSThe main beach is not huge but the sand is soft and the water is calm and beautiful and perfect for floating on the couples provided loungers. It was never too crowded and we easily found loungers regardless of what time we showed up. There is a bit of seaweed and fish activity in the water so I used my water shoes here to make sure I did n\u2019t step on anything unpleasant. Sunset Beach and pool is the au natural area of the resort. A short walk from the main beach you enter through a gate with plenty of privacy. Clothing is not optional here until after 5 PM and there are guards present. The beach here is deeper and has loungers more spaced out than the main beach. Many loungers had palapas and it was easy to grab a pair in the shade. The water itself and the entry into the water is the downside here. It \u2019s very rocky water shoes are a must and the edge of the water has a river emptying into the water making the temperature a bit uneven and resulting in murkier and slightly smelly water. We still enjoyed some time here and enjoyed being au natural for a bit but the main beach was more pleasant. There is access to the ocean near Charlie \u2019s spa as well. From here people would float on the couples provided floating lounges or snorkel around this area. There is even a small stretch of sand nearby depending on the tide which we enjoyed sitting on and letting the ocean wash over our feet. All of the pools were clean well maintained and had ideal water temperature. The Sunset pool was always packed with people and everyone was very friendly and nice. My husband and I went over for some drinks and to cool off in the pool a few times and always felt welcome to hang out with the groups at the bar. It was great and very friendly and not at all creepy but we preferred not being as social as the pool was so we did n\u2019t spend much time at that particular pool. The main pool was pretty crowded and social as well so we also did n\u2019t spend much time there. It was a lovely pool with a swim up bar and good drinks. The mineral pool near the spa was our favorite pool. It has an incredible view of the ocean and is secluded up in the less crowded area of the resort. There \u2019s also a very chilly mineral grotto and a hidden hot tub nearby. There is n\u2019t a bar located near this pool but the smoothie hut is right at the pool. We brought down some rum from our room and added it to the fresh made to order smoothies and it was a delicious solution. The lobby pool was almost always empty. It has a lovely rock waterfall and was perfect for a quick dip on a hot walk back up to G but the pool did n\u2019t have any loungers surrounding it and was not near any exterior restrooms or a pool bar The Balloon Bar is right there but not open until later in the dayWATERSPORTSThe watersports hut is available at the end of main beach and has its own roped off section for the boats kayaks etc. to launch from. This little hut is what made this trip so special for us. We did a different water activity every day and almost all of them were completely included in our trip. Christopher and Fabian at the watersports area are incredible. They are energetic patient accommodating and friendly. We took two free snorkeling trips offered daily twice a day which included a short boat ride out to a reef and sunken ship. We were given more than enough time to enjoy the snorkeling before heading back to shore. Christopher was our captain. I do n\u2019t know if it \u2019s always like this but our morning snorkeling was much more enjoyable than the afternoon trip because the water was clearer and we were given more time in the water. We also enjoyed the padleboat and water skiing which were both included. Fabian gave us a wonderful hobiecat sailing lesson one day which was also included. The highlight of our trip was the champagne sunset cruise. This was an extra charge but it was beyond worth the cost. For 250 you get a 90 minute private boat ride along the coast champagne and snacks capped off by a perfect view of the sunset. Christopher was our captain and made the slightly choppy water feel like smooth sailing. We \u2019re from the gulf and if ever we \u2019re on a boat during a hurricane we \u2019l want Christopher as our captain. Fabian was the most patient and personable sports tour guide. He pointed out landmarks along the coast and took photos of us. We even managed to spot some dolphins and turtles on our ride. The experience was truly one of a kind. FOOD AND DRINKSThe food here is very very good. Every meal we had was incredibly enjoyable with a great variety and wonderful service. Breakfast \u2013 options room service. PalazinaOn most nights we hung the breakfast selection card on our door. With this you can choose a delivery time and get items such as pastries cereal bread coffee and juice. This was a great way to start the day off by having a small breakfast in the room before going on our daily adventure. The coffee was very good. Our items always arrived with the 30 minute window we specified. There is also a full breakfast room service menu available. Palazina breakfast is buffet but includes made to order stations for omelets waffles and pancakes. My husband enjoyed a fresh waffle with banana syrup immensely. The food on the buffet line was hot and good and you could fix your own bloody mary or mimosa. Severs come around to refill your coffee and water. Lunch \u2013 options. room service Palazina the grilFor lunch we kept coming back to the beach grill again and again. I still miss it now. Every item we got there was delicious. There is full table service at the grill and all items are made to order. The snapper sandwich is perfect and delicious and my husband ordered it at least 3 times during our stay. The meat pies were hot and good and flavorful. The fries come out in individual servings and are hot and crispy. The individual pizzas were tasty. I could n\u2019t get enough of the jerk chicken caesar salad. The dressing was just perfect and was such a nice refreshing lunch to have outdoors. We ate lunch at Palazina twice. The lunch was buffet but like the breakfast there is a hot station with items made to order. The day with pad thai to order was delightful. There is also a station with freshly baked pizza. The jerk chicken pizza was amazing. I also had some good items from the buffet line including a lovely pasta salad and a curry conch dish that was wonderful. On the second day we ate lunch here it was uncomfortably warm inside and we wished we would have dined outside with the fans and ocean breeze. Dinner \u2013 options room service Palazina Casanova. Bela VistaWe had dinner at Palazina once and our waiter Derik was very friendly and attentive. During dinner Palazina becomes ala carte with full table service. The soup and both of our entrees were lovely. We dined outside to ensure we \u2019d get a nice breeze. We ate dinner at the fanciest restaurant Casanova once during our stay. Reservations were easy to make at the guest services desk. The food was delicious and service was great but we preferred the atmosphere at Bela Vista so much that we never returned to Casanova. The beachside grill becomes Bela Vista restaurant for dinner. It has full table service with outdoor seating right by the ocean. The menu changed several times throughout the week you can ask your server which days repeat so we never felt like we were getting the same food repeatedly. The soups and entrees were all delicious here and the service was good. The service at all restaurants was great and our food always came out hot. Live music could be heard from both Casanova and Bela Vista during our dinners and made the nights even more special. THEME NIGHTSTuesday is the Jamaica party night on the main lawn. Since we arrived late on a Tuesday we arrived after the event had started. We claimed an empty table that had already been cleared away and enjoyed a lovely buffet dinner. Servers bring wine and water regularly. The food was good and hot despite the fact that we were late. Friday night is the gala night on the main lawn. No other restaurants are open on Friday nights. We joined a table but did n\u2019t really chat much with our dining neighbors. We had an excellent variety of freshly prepared food. Made to order pasta stations and freshly grilled meat was readily available. The food was good but we did enjoy our nights at the restaurants much more. DRINKS BARSDrinks are readily available at the resort and are very good quality. Name brand liquor is available and used in mixed drinks. The house wines and champagne is a little bit sweeter than I would normally drink I typically enjoy very dry wine champagne but I found it to be drinkable particularly when you want a break from the fruity drinks. The fruity drinks are also great and we consumed quite a few banana daiquiris margaritas and rum punches. There are bars located at the main pool sunset beach pool beachside grill balloon bar Palazina and martini bar. The beachside bar was our favorite. It \u2019s in a great central location for the beach main pool water activities area and lunch. The view ca n\u2019t be beat and the drinks are nice strong and served by wonderful bartenders like Trevardo and Quesian. The martini bar located below the lobby pool opens up in the evenings and is the perfect spot for a pre dinner drink. Bryan learned what types of drinks we like and made us some of the best drinks we had all week. His pasionfruit martini was blissful. We did n\u2019t \u2019 spend much time at the main pool bar or the balloon bar but received good service every time we stopped in for a quick drink. The staff the sunset beach bar did an amazing job of keeping up with everyone \u2019s drink needs. There was always a pack of people around the bar but you never had to wait long for your drink. SPAWe booked a 50 minute couples massage at the spa. Massages are done at the top of the cliffs in private huts overlooking the water. The atmosphere is so private peaceful and relaxing with the sound of ocean waves in the background. Thelma and Keryan did a wonderful job and left us feeling relaxed and serene for the rest of our trip. I highly recommend this for the first or second full day of the trip. SERVICEThe service here was 100 incredible. Every member of the staff is helpful friendly and works very hard. We adhered to the resort \u2019s no tipping policy and received excellent treatment wherever we went. I \u2019ve mentioned names throughout the review but I will mention again the people who really stood out and made our stay extraordinary Tevin and Karyan at the front desk Thelma and Karyan at the spa Yanika at the watersports hut Bryan at the martini bar Trevardo and Quesian at the beach bar and Christopher and Fabian at watersports. Honestly before we go back I \u2019d want to make sure that Christopher and Fabaian are still there. Every highlight of our trip includes an activity with one or both of them presentOveral we had a perfectly wonderful week at Sans Souci. The resort never felt crowded despite being near capacity. The property is gorgeous and extremely well maintained and clean.", "offset": [4162, 4290], "date": "2017-06-27", "cpt": "1", "category": "general"}, {"id": 16, "uid": "c50f8c4a-4118-456a-911d-b54a4af755e7", "sentence": "Hibiscus Cottage Simply Amazing. My husband and I just returned from our 5 night stay in the Hibiscus Cottage at Sans Souci. Both of us were absolutely blown away by our experience there. If it were not for the cottage being available we may not have chosen this resort to vacation. We are so glad we did. I have never stayed at a resort where I made a point to remember certain staff members names because they were so exceptional. The cottage was very large with a separate mini kitchen and big separate living room and really large bathroom with double sinks separate shower jacuzi tub and large closet area. But the best part was the outside. We ate breakfast every morning on our large covered front porch overlooking the ocean. We had our own private jacuzi that we used every day. We had the utmost of privacy. We were treated like a king and queen by the staff truly. Room service was quick always as were the people who refilled our mini bar requests. Elizabeth was our room attendant and she really made our stay special. She was sweet and friendly and gave us so much information to help make our stay wonderful. Martin was extremely helpful making sure our jacuzi was the perfect temperature. Nothing was overlokedWe ate dinner at Casanova most nights and our food was beyond excellent. The chef really knows how to prepare steak to the exact temperature. And even got my salmon right the first time. most chefs tend to over cook it. Sunshyn made sure we got the perfect table each night and that our service was tip top. We came to eat here each night for 2 reasons excellent food and Sunshyn. She knows what customer service truly means. Another staff member who went out of his way so that our dinners were enjoyable was Kerdaine. He was friendly and helpful at the Anniversary party too and made sure we were never in need of anything. We booked a private sunset boat trip with Dwight on our last evening and even with rain and no visible sunset Dwight made it so worth it. Would definately go again with Dwight. There are a few CONS from our stay During the Tuesday night barbecue we were seated at a table by ourselves not a problem. Fifteen minutes into our dinner two of the servers began loading our table with all of the unused glassware from surrounding tables. It was absolutely rude and crazy. Our quaint table suddenly became the deposit for 30 40 glasses. BUT there were plenty of empty tables around us for them to store their glasses. So my husband and I grabbed our plates and wine and moved ourselves to another table. No one apologized or even helped us moveAnother problem is the drink service on the beach. One day out of five we were given a blue flag to call the attendant when you needed a drink. The flag never worked. Each day we had to walk to the bar to get our own drinks. All of the other people were doing the same thing because there simply was no beach service. This has never happened to us at a Secrets resort. I also felt the drinks at the beach bar were watered down unles you asked for a double or a floater on top. There are not enough lounge chairs on the beach and no one to help locate one or help set up. You are pretty much on your own at the beach. Man made beach was not a favorite of mine. No white sand and no waves and the water was not clear at all until you got out pretty far. The bathroom in the Hibiscus cottage is huge great plus. But the toilet sits in the middle of this huge bathroom. Would be so much better if there were a toilet room inside the extremely large bathroom. Both my husband and I felt the same way. A small bit of privacy please. even after 26 years of marriage lol.", "offset": [0, 32], "date": "2018-01-16", "cpt": "1", "category": "general"}, {"id": 17, "uid": "ab642beb-a802-48f3-92ac-a3c300e551e9", "sentence": "Beautiful property Average everything else. My husband and I visited Couples Sans Souci for the New Year the second time doing so at a Couples resort. Our room was very nice looking straight out onto the beach. It was spacious and clean nothing to complain about. The property once we took the time to explore it was beautiful. Many hidden pathways among the hills quiet resting spots and pools. We especially liked the au naturel beach. The reason I give this resort only 3 stars is because of the staff and the food. I do this in comparison to Couples Ochos Rios. Ochos Rios wins hands down better food and much friendlier staff. But this is just me. those things are important to me. But if you stay to yourself and want a more beautiful property then choose Sans Souci.", "offset": [211, 263], "date": "2018-02-17", "cpt": "1", "category": "general"}, {"id": 18, "uid": "38fa251e-ac26-4baf-b183-3d7b54e63529", "sentence": "They helped to make our honeymoon even better than we could have dreamed. To start we easily found their lounge at the airport and were greeted in a friendly and organized manner. The lounge included Red Stripe on tap comfortable seating and clean bathrooms. We did not spend much time there before being escorted to the bus. The bus ride is a little on the long side about 2 hours but we did not feel crammed in. Upon our arrival at the check in we were provided sparkling wine and warm damp towels. I will spare you a play by play recap of our entire trip and summarize by saying that the staff were INCREDIBLY kind and friendly. They really went out of their way to ensure we never felt like were inconveniencing them. The food was MUCH better than I expected as a vegetarian I have low standards most places but quality and freshness were plentiful in every meal even buffets. Carol makes a memorable omelet. Activities were easy to sign up for they even accommodated us last minute on a trip. I will say do your research beforehand. On our first excursion the bus driver was helpful in explaining what to expect and tipping culture but not before we had left all our money back at the resort. Thankfully his advice helped us navigate a crafters market but we left feeling terrible at not tipping the trip guide. Some other highlights we opted to have a private dinner added cost and our server Omar did a fantastic job. He provided great service and also knew when to give us privacy. They were also very accommodating in allowing us to select two different menus I may be vegetarian but my husband is a carnivore. Rooms were perfectly sized quiet even with music outside and they stock your mini bar with generous bottles of alcohol. Be prepared to climb stairs you will get your workout in each day. Additionally the water pressure in the shower was perfect and there was no shortage of towels even beach towels and not just the laughably sized ones at most hotels. Golfing at a nearby Sandals course was a blast know that cart club and caddy are added costs. There are also a couple photographers around the resort though we mostly saw Lewy and we did a complimentary photo shoot with Lewy. When we were leaving we went to look to see what photos they had snapped. They had over 100 of us from just over 3 days. It was nice to have so many taken for us which can be bought for an added cost and Lewy did a great job. The cost of purchasing all of them is a little steep but they really give you a lot and just as with the shops all prices can be haggled a bit. Additionally anyone we asked to use our phone to take a photo for us including the actual photographer was willing to. In summary this is a smaller resort which is what we were looking for. so you will get a little more intimate feel from it. There are lots of nooks and crannies to explore and a ton of actives to keep you busy. It is a beautiful blend of moving and relaxing. Be prepared to eat again a perfect mix of things that were new to us and more familiar Americana cuisine. Take the time to chat with the staff you will be glad you did. They are friendly fun approachable and welcoming.", "offset": [2320, 2424], "date": "2019-06-20", "cpt": "1", "category": "general"}, {"id": 19, "uid": "1789b7cc-0238-416d-9b5f-5dc29c34fcb9", "sentence": "Honeymoon.
