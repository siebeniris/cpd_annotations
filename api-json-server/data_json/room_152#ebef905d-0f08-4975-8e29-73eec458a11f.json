My wife and I stayed here for one night after an evening arrival following a long transatlantic flight as we did n\u2019t want to pick up the hire car and brave the LA traffic whilst we were tired. It turned out to be a very good tactic. After clearing immigration we went outside to get the van and typically seemed to see every other hotel van before three in a row for the Mariot appeared. The wait was only a few minutes so was n\u2019t an issue. The hotel is vast and very busy. I had checked in on line and our room key was waiting. A very nice lady checked us into a room on the tenth floor of 18 she took time to explain the facilities of the hotel and arrangements for the lounge and breakfast etc. Our room was a huge corner mini suite. Very nice. We headed up to the lounge for a drink and had a chat with the manager who was just starting to lay out the evening food. I reminisced about my last visit to this hotel with my brother in November 205 when the lobby was converted to a Casino as they were filming the Ben Afleck movie Smoking Aces. I had a bit of pasta with caesar salad. They also brought some very nice fried chicken out so we did n\u2019t go hungry. There was also a nice selection of sweets and cheeses laid out buffet style. It was still an honour bar for alcohol 4 for a bottle of beer which is n\u2019t too bad but 8 for a glass of wine is very steep considering all European and Asian Mariots comp these during the evening. Breakfast was served in the lounge. We went up at 630am and it was already quite busy a typical Mariot like selection of fruit plus cereals sausage scrambled egg and pastries more than enough to set us up for the day the coffee was rather bitter. so much so that very unlike me I only had two cups. Most of the people in the lounge were students all appeared to be from sort of swim team summer camp or similar no effort was made to check anyone when a group of eight came in. In fact I saw a lot of \u2018 tailgating \u2019 into the lounge in both the evening and morning session. All in all the hotel was all that we asked for and I would not have a problem staying there again after a long flight or before I flew out of LAX. Another bonus for us was that the Alamo depot was only a short ish. walk away and walking was certainly quicker then getting the shuttle back to to the airport to get the Alamo shuttle.

I am a Lifetime Platinum Premier and stayed almost 190 nights with Mariot in 2017The check in at the Elite desk was the most unwelcoming I have ever encountered to date at any Mariot anywhere in the world. The staff showed the most unwelcoming and indifference attitude I have ever witnessed. This is likely reflective of poor training in customer service and communication skills for a Mariot flagship property at the airport. I booked two rooms for a family stay for four nights. Checked in at around 3 PM. Was told 1 of the 2 rooms for 2 double beds was not ready. I came back with my family at 630 to check in the 2nd room. I was asked to wait and the rep walked away for well over 5 mins. He did not explain to me why I had to wait or what was the issue. I then asked a second rep at the same elite desk and she told me I will have to wait for the other rep to return. I was annoyed that she did not seemed to want to make the effort to locate her colleague to ask him what is the problem. I grew inpatient and got more annoyed that she very quickly responded that she shal be calling SECURITY instead. She said I was raising my voice and she does not need this from any customer. I told her I am only asking her to locate her colleague and instead she repeated with a threat of calling security. Immediately myself being an Asian person I pictured another potential incident of a Dr Dong experience with United Airlines. only this time at a hotel where I am their top elite members. Very nice reception at the Elite DeskThe rep finally returned and when I asked him the reason for the delay he told me that it was beyond his control that the room was not ready. Obviously someone dropped the ball. either himself or the house keeper but no one wishes to take ownership for the delayI told him that he could have very easily told me at the beginning that there was a problem but not just asking mr to wait and walked away. Firstly the same rep at check in did not do the following compared to 99 at other Mariot properties1. Usually a simple welcome as a premium elite member and thanking me for my loyalty2. When asked if there is an upgrade for my stay he responded that he considered a room on a higher floor is an upgrade. FYI Mariot this is already in my profile for preference for higher floor so this is NOT an upgrade3. I made the reservation for 2 rooms for 4 nights on the Mariot website and he mistakenly thought that the 2nd room was for 1 night instead of 4 nights. 4. No apology for the discrepancy or the room not being ready or any mention of compensation for an a negative experience. At other Mariot properties when my room was not ready as promised or there is an error they would offered extra points drink or meal voucher etc Again truly reflective of poor training or just inexperience or indifference staff catering elite members. I hate to see how they will treat non elite members. This is my 2 stay this year at this property and shal be my last.

The rooms are clean and modern. A problem is you can clearly hear noise and talking from guests in the hallway. They were quiet at night so not big issue. The pool area is big and nicely landscaped with palm trees and flowers. It sits in the courtyard area in middle of hotel. it is a beautiful area to lounge and swim. My personal issue with the hotel concerned a lack of personal attention. I have been a Mariot Rewards member for many years and we were on anniversary trip to New York City and Niagara Falls. When I mentioned this to the Service Rep he gave us a lukewarm congratulations. I thought maybe a thank you for being such a loyal member and for your anniversary we will get you nice room would have been a nice gesture. But I guess they are too jaded as they are an LA hotel. Oh well it was only an overnight stay but it left me with sour taste about Mariot hotels. My suggestion to any LAX traveler would be about parking. We needed airport parking for an 8 day trip. Parking at the Mariot was expensive. But using ParkWiz we saved at least half of the cost and were able to valet park at the Mariot for 12 day. A really great deal. Would I recommend Mariot LAX. Yes. I would use it again if needed. Would I expect some nice personal touch. No. By the way when asked by Mariot to rate my experience I told them same things mentioned here. Their response.

Classic but clean and modern. My expectations of airport hotels especially near LAX are pretty low since the hotels were built 40 or more years ago. I have to say I was very surprised at how nice the Mariot LAX was. It may be classic but is thoroughly modern in almost every way. The pool area in particular was very nicely done and maintains a classic California vibe but still modern. Not many hotels today would have a 10fot deep pool. The area around the pool was expansive and nicely landscaped with several places to relax and enjoy a drink. The hotel is huge but well maintained. It was a pretty long walk to the room but I did not mind. The room I had was large and overlooked the pool area. It had a patio that was large but I would have preferred a floor other than the 5th as it was a bit boxed in by some of the awnings. The room was modern and nicely appointed with a fridge and the usual things you had expect at a Mariot. My mother in law is an Executive Platinum which meant free access to the M Lounge on the 18th floor. I was impressed with the lounge and the quality of the food. Great views of the LAX runway. I could have sat up there for hours watching planes land and take off. I wish they had an outdoor area for even better plane watching. On the opposite end of the lounge is a great view of downtown Los Angeles. There was a large modern and clean club lounge bathroom as well. The only annoyance here was parking. I thought there was only a surface lot but there is underground parking too but I did not realize it until there was no more surface parking and I had to go to the valet area where they told me you can park underneath the building. We eventually found a spot pretty far under the building. A lot of people park and ride fo the airport so even when the hotel is not that busy the parking lot is usually full. There was another customer service issue with our room as we had requested feather free pillows. When we called the front desk after discovering they were feather they said they were out and would let us know if they found some. No call back so we ended up putting a decorative pillow in a case and using that. With that said the manager was amazing the next day and helped make up for this inconvenience.
