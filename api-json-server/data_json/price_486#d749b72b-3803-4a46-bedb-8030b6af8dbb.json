BRIDES BEWARE. DISCRIMINATORY AGAINST HANDICAP. Group travelers beware. This hotel honestly ruined my wedding day experience. From the beginning the management was unreachable and had conflicting statements. We tried to set up the block and no one ever got back to us. The turnover rate within management is so high we worked with 3 people within a year. And all three were inadequate. Our last sales manager Regie Astorga never returned our calls and continued to lie about the amenities we would receive. They tried to charge me and my future husband for a room and the contract said I would get one for free if I booked 15 rooms we had 30 rooms. The staff told some people the price was 699 and others that it was 1599. Some of my family were given breakfast coupons and some were not. The coupons were supposed to be provided as a gift for the block. Breakfast in the morning was a joke. They had one cook working for the entire breakfast. We waited 30 minutes in line just to get some bacon. My one family member booked her hotel in January and asked for a seated chair for bathing. They assured her they would provide one. When she checked in they told her that they only have one chair for the whole hotel and it was being used. Basically during her stay they told her she could not bathe. Since we were not offered the Bridal Suite my brother in law booked it for us. This typically comes standard to the bride and groom at other hotels not the Wyndham. Lastly the shuttle to and from the Chateau Ritz was a mess. My reception started at 630 and Regie wanted to start shuttling guests over at 50. She said there is only one driver and that with the amount of people I had he had to start that early. When we signed the contract I was told there are two shuttles by the way. So I had to extend my limo and had my limo come pick up my guests from the hotel and take them to my venue. For the return trip the shuttle driver was extremely rude. My wedding ended at 1230 and he told everyone at 145 it was the last trip he was making. Fearful of not having a ride back my parents and in laws got on the shuttle. Therefore they missed the last hour of our reception. When I called corporate they told me that they could not do anything for me because I signed a contract. They were just as rude as the management and staff at the Glenview location. I WILL NEVER STAY AT ANOTHER WYNDHAM AGAIN.

Just completed a three night stay at this wonderful property. This was obviously an Embassy Suites at some point. I believe it was a Wyndham before this but it is a very nice Mariot now. As usual I will write this review listing pros and cons. Pros 1. All suites in the style of an Embassy Suites. One major difference is that they have family suites which are just slightly more expensive than regular suites. It is like an Embassy Suites room except there is an extra queen bed in the living room along with the couch2. Free parking3. Free internet if Mariot member otherwise free computers in loby4. Really nice workout facilities with new Matrix cardio machines free weights and weight machines5. Great staff Everyone was super nice and friendly especially the aforementioned Diana in previous reviews in the Concierge Room. The front desk staff and restaurant staff were great as well. Trina who helped rebok my reservation went the price went down was great as wel6. A great rate. In talking to the staff I learned that Alstate Insurance down the road usually has the entire hotel booked most weekdays but not the weekends. The result is very nice rates. We paid 101 for two King Suites and 132 for the family suites. We wouldt have stayed in downtown Chicago on a bet but I did check rates and they were 350 to 450 a night7. Rooms were very comfortable with new beds two HD TVs a couch a refrigerator and a microwave8. As a platinum member we had access to the Concierge Room on the 7th floor. I learned that this was a former Presidential Suite. Plenty of breakfast choices in the morning and hot food cheese vegetables and desserts in the evening. Like most Mariots the Concierge Room is closed from Friday midday to Sunday night. For breakfast Sunday we received vouchers for the restaurant. Each voucher was worth 32 in food either from the buffet or the menu9. Indoor pool did not useCONS1. So I did my homework and specifically requested and received three rooms on the non freeway side of the hotel. Since we were on the non freeway side and this is a former Embassy Suites we had the entire indoor courtyard as insulation as well. We never heard the freeway once we were in the hotel. I was told they are putting up sound barriers but I would still absolutely request the non freeway side2. While the Matrix cardio equipment had TVs as part of the equipment none were functional. There are two large TVs with remote however that work3. I think there is a shuttle that will take you to restaurants locally but none are within walking distance. We did eat at Johnnys Kitchen about one mile and it was very good. So if you do not have a car that could be an isue4. The room furnishings while comfortable were a little bland. One of our group described the rooms as sterile. Not a lot of color or ambiance but we were mainly there to sleep. As a point of info check your rate as your reservation gets closer. Our rate dropped three times in the week before we arrived. I screen shot it each time and they honored the lower rate when we checked in. Overall a great stay and we will definitely stay there on our next trip to the Chicago area.
