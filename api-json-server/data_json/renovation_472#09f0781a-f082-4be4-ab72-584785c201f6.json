When we asked for description of the room we were upgraded to staff there described the room we originally booked. Upon further inquiry she specifically said your upgrade is a king suite with a kitchen dining area living room and a separate private area a den with a separate bath. I was satisfied with that. Upon arriving we were given the room originally booked not the upgrade. When we made it clear this was Not the upgrade we were given another room on a higher floor that was exactly the same as the room we had just moved from. the floor plan space was the same. We were polite but very clear that this apparent confusion misrepresentation was unacceptable. We were then moved to another room that again was the same area space and similar layout as the unit we had just left. We were clearly discouraged and very tired from traveling all day. Our dissatisfaction obvious we were then shown another unit the exact unit that was finally described to us when the upgrade was requested the day prior to arrival and were then told we had to pay an additional amount per night in order to stay in that unit. Since the rooms we had moved from had stained dinette chairs rugs as well as other issues we just said fine. Apparently the W needed the additional money more than we did. Poor management decisions poor upkeep of the units we were offered. Overall an extremely disappointing experience leaving us with a negative feeling about the W Perhaps if I had not called about the upgrade the day before and gotten the specific details we may not have felt so so disappointed with the W We never expected such a grueling check in and have never experienced anything like it before or since.", "offset": [1396, 1463], "date": "2015-01-04", "cpt": "0", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "e41b3dee-d02a-401b-affe-b357ed365fe0", "sentence": "Top of the line Hotel. My Wife and I have stayed at this W many times since its opening. We have at least two trips per year to Fort Lauderdale. We typically choose Starwod Hotels. The Best travel program that exists. The quality of the Starwod and the W starts with the Personnel. Starting at the Management level right through to the front desk greeting bell people housekeeping maintenance room service etc etc. At this W one Manager is Mr Lopez he has been here since we started coming. We travel extensively on a yearly basis and without a doubt we have not come across a more genuine harder working professional representing their organization. If you think you have a problem this gentleman is all about solving it. Another is Mr Harris. We have seen him move up to a Front Desk Manager since his earlier beginnings. This young man is all about Customer Service. With personnel like Mr Harris the W knows how to recognize and keep excellent people. With our most recent 3 night pre cruise stay everyone we encountered was all about Customer Service greeting us always in a friendly manner. I will mention some of these excellently skilled personnel Jeremy who checked us in James a customer greeter David a trainee from the Netherlands Kristan another Trainee Oliver valet parking and Brian Front Desk reservation. All these personnel were tops with Customer Service and made and make us feel valuable clients of the WI read some reviews and they seem to have some issues. I like to give management a chance to resolve any issue. If given a chance The W and any Starwod Program Hotel has the personnel that are willing to make your stay as good as it gets. They need the chance to do it without being treated in a less than manner. I can tell you from experience some people will always have a problem and do not really want it fixed. So if you want a great vacation and stay for whatever reason in Fort Lauderdale The W is tops for accommodation location services amenities management and whatever else goes with a 5 Star Hotel stay. Total thumbs up to the W in Fort Lauderdale.", "offset": [282, 414], "date": "2015-04-02", "cpt": "0", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 2, "uid": "6f46f378-85f2-4dba-ad1a-8a745bdb8a41", "sentence": "Hotel Room Needs Updating and Needs to be Cleanier.
