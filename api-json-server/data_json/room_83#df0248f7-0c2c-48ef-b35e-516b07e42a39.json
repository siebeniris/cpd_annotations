This is a great hotel. The staff remembers who you are why you are there and what your room preference is. Front desk manager Mr Duncan is extremely friendly and professional.

The staff that prepares the morning breakfast is always nice and I have even heard them offer to make something different for guests when the selection is not what the guest is looking for. Rooms are clean updated. 7 floors and 2 elevators so can be a wait sometimes. Ask for a room NOT facing the freeway.

We typically love this hotel as it is convenient to shops restaurants and many fun things to do. While it is a little hard to find it is not as bad as others have said. Pull in at the Hampton Inn sign. We checked in and all seemed smooth after someone showed up at the desk. Manager James was very apologetic that we had to wait an entire 2 minutes. While room was getting old it was still clean and beds comfortable. Went out for a while and came back about 2 hours later. UH no water in the room. Oh wait there it is and it is BROWN. HMCaled front desk and they put us in a different room. Person who helped us was apologetic as well and said they would give us 100 points for our troubles and that will be enough for a free room. Really. Do you know how many points a room costsAnyway Temperature in room was a little off that night as hotel is showing its age. Very noisy guests that night which is not the fault of the hotel but the next morning there were people sitting on a luggage cart outside our door talking pretty loudly. Come on people please respect your environment and others who may be staying there. Upon check out we met the Manager James again and told him of our displeasure with our stay. We walked up to him and he knew our names and he remembered that he checked us in and even what room number. That is very nice. He said he was very sorry and that the night person did send him an email about the brown water. He explained about the lobby that was just renovated and the in December the rooms would be completely renovated. Bedding furniture bathrooms. He made sure that the we were compensated for our troubles so we will be back just maybe after the renovations are complete.", "offset": [766, 906], "date": "2015-04-09", "cpt": "0", "category": "room"}, {"id": 3, "uid": "9d849444-4d54-497e-8ff4-1185726c739e", "sentence": "King Of Prussia May visit.

Our room was plenty large for two people and spotless. The amenities in the bathroom were just right. The beds were comfortable and we got the rest we desperately needed. Breakfast was included and while not fancy it was better than expected. We loved the coffee in the lobby all day and night too. The only drawback is that because of the high traffic in the location it can be tricky navigating in and out. But that is a problem in the entire King of Prussia area not just that neighborhood.

I stayed at the Hampton Inn King of Prussia in September 18 \u2013 21 2017. This is the worst Hilton Property I have ever experienced. I arrived early evening and was given a room that has from my inspection not been changed cleaned from the previous guest. As I was getting ready to turn down the bed I found long hair between the sheets. I called the front desk to ask to be moved to a different room. The attendant said that he would have someone deliver a different room key within 10 minutes. Twenty minutes later nobody had come delivered a new room key to a different room. While waiting for the new room I noticed that the bathroom too had hair on the floor and the shower area had soap scum. Since it was late in the evening I packed my suitcase and proceeded to the front desk. The attendant was just getting ready to send someone to move me to a different room. I was given a different room on a different floor. Prior to settling in I inspected the room in which I found hair again and a dirty bathroom. I again went to the front desk to request a different room. I was assigned room 604 needless to say the room had not been cleaned the dark carpeting in the room and the bathroom floor had litter \u2013 vacuuming had not been done for some time. Since it was now later in the evening I remained in this room at least there was no hair in the bed sheets. In the morning I noticed that the shower doors were coming off the hinges. I reported this to the front desk who actually did follow through and had that fixed by the time I returned in the afternoon. Before leaving I left a note for housekeeping to sweep and vacuum the floor. This was done but the debris was simply swept to the front threshold of the room and remained there for three days. The morning of my first full day at this property I spoke to the assistant manager Gerome M about the hair and uncleanliness of the three rooms I had been offered. He apologized and offered me an incentive for the inconvenient. He asked that I speak to him on the day I was to check out and he would issue the incentive. When I checked out he was not available but the front desk staff said that she would leave a note and ask him to issue me the incentive. A week later I had not heard from Gerome I called the Hampton Inn he said that he would request the incentive to be issues. A week later again nothing as far as the compensation. I attempted again to communicate with Gerome and after three days of calling and leaving messages finally was able to speak to him. He send me an e mail stating the request of the compensation. However to this day nothing has been issued to me from Gerome M. I am a loyal Hilton property guest and was very dissatisfied with the quality of rooms specifically the lack of maintenance not only in the rooms but he hallways the workout facilities and the general common areas. This property lacks much attention as far as cleanliness and overall appeal.

I am a Hilton Diamond member so I know what \u2019s good and bad and this property did n\u2019t make the cut. To be clear I rarely give anyone such low ratings so you know it \u2019s not good. This was also the first ever Hilton property that I have left early. that \u2019s right we checked out and left. Check in was a breeze with the digital key in fact done entirely on my phone. The elevators were filthy and in poor repair even the Hampton Inn stickers on the doors were peeling up. Got to the first room and noticed the roll up black out curtain was broke. Went to the desk to switch rooms. They were very pleasant and switched us. Through conversation she was glad I was n\u2019t complaining about more problems. I asked if people were and she said oh yes. second red flag. We get to the new room and immediately see housekeeping issues. It was just poorly cleaned and it \u2019s obvious there is no inspection. The toilet had a ring on the inside glass on the shower was spotted mirror was spotted hair on the ceiling dust all over the room. then the general condition of the room was dated. Chipped paint on the door loud AC and ripped curtains. Oh speaking of loud we were on the side that faces the highway. well it \u2019s so loud it \u2019s as if the window was open. not kidding. We seteled in and the sleep was ok at best. The next morning the more I saw the more disgusted I was. I did some Hotel Impossible style inspections and was grossed out. dust everywhere. It \u2019s obvious these folks do n\u2019t know how to clean a room. I made my way again to the desk and said we would be leaving. When they found out why they said they hated to see us go over that but for me there was no more chances. We booked the rest of the trip that morning at the Doubletree a block up the road and all I can say is wow what a difference. Anyways I have no clue how his Hampton Inn passes any sort of Hilton inspection. I really would n\u2019t be surprised to see it rebranded soon. The problems are all management and training issues. It \u2019s very clear they do n\u2019t know how to run a property. It \u2019s sad because it \u2019s giving the Hilton brand a horrible name.
