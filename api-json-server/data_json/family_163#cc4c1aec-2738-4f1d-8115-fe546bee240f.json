I stayed here 5 nights while on a business trip office reserved this hotel for me. The hotel is clearly ageing the bathroom has evident sign of age cracked tiles and cracked ceiling panels rooms is oldish style too definitely not a 5 start level. Having said that everything work quite well and there are no issues. The best part is the service which make the staying very comfortable this is a 5 star quality service It is evident that the personnel is properly trained and controlled I have to make a special thanks to the beach guy which found my watch that I forgot on the lay down chair he promptly returned it to the lost and found not many hotel you can count on such honesty. The pool and the beach are nice specially during the week mornings in the week end the place transforms to an expat zoo. Anyway overall a very nice staying with excellent food at the JW steak restaurant I would definitely recommend this place to anyone.

This property looks nice when you are the lobby etc. however once you enter the lift and the corridors it look dingy and not inviting. The rooms I was in the Tower Section looked very jaded and as a business traveller did nt find it good at all. It really needs a renovation to make it more attractive. the only good thing was the JWs Steakhouse which had some amazing food and the view from the rooms.

The rooms were surprisingly big and had a nice view. We went to the pool to spend some downtime and walked to the beach which was very soothing. There we had a great view of the city. We then had some food at the cafe. The food was good and had a variety of options. There was a spa but we did n\u2019t use it. Instead I hit the gym and will say that this was a true gym.
