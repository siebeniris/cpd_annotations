We worked with Jenifer Byrne from Tropical Travelers who absolutely planned the best time for us. We had direct flights from Boston transportation to and from the airport to the resort and also a few snorkeling sailing adventures. The Hyat is definitely the nicest of the hotels in its surrounding area and there are many places to walk to for dining and activities. It also had a few restaurants at the resort to eat at and all of which had great food. Ruinas del Mar was my favorite for breakfasts and dinners. They also had a great Mexican restaurant an in the pool bar beachside dining a juice bar an outdoor bar between the pool and beach a typical hotel restaurant the Palms as well as a small cafe market type place. The spa was also great we had pedicures and a couples massage. The staff in the spa and throughout the resort was always very friendly. We spent most days at the beach rather than the pool if you wait in line by 7ish each morning you can reserve a tiki hut this way you will have some shade. It was an amazing time there and we were so happy that Jenifer had booked us the Hyat since we had never been to Aruba before. It is definitely One Happy Island and my husband and I can not wait to return to the Hyat for future anniversaries or vacations.", "offset": [320, 455], "date": "2015-06-01", "cpt": "0", "category": "fitness"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "2de3b8d2-f668-48cc-b431-ff0328afd402", "sentence": "1st Trip to Aruba. The resort was well managed and the rooms were clean. Staff especially in the restaurants were very friendly and helpful. The beach area was great with lots of opportunities to participate in water sports or to just relax. This is a great location with many restaurants shopping and activities within walking distance. The only downsides were that most rooms have only a step out balcony. I would definitely request an ocean front room next time. We were unaware that renovations were being done just above our room.

The rooms are very nice even in comparison to the Ritz here which I \u2019ve also stayed at twice. the Ritz is just down the beachThe Spa Olga the therapist was phenomenal. I had four different spa treatments all of them wonderful. The beach is breathtaking and the beach staff were all very attentive. Plenty Of chairs at both beach and pool. no need to get up early here to get your seat for the day at either spot. I loved the polside restaurant and had lunch there every day. \u2022Fish Tacos Tuna WrapI also had an excellent dinner at three of the Hyat \u2019s restaurant being a foodie I was impressed.

We had the most amazing vacation at the Hyat. Hands down one of the best experiences we have ever had. We arrived a bits early and our room was n\u2019t ready. The wonderful woman at the check in desk was very accommodating and had sand toys ready for the kids towels and a key to the gym bathroom to change. We sure did n\u2019t mind waiting at all playing at the beach. The gym is where we started our day and was clean and stocked with fresh fruit and cold towels. The Shoco Market Caf\u00e9 had plenty of breakfast items for our family and the coffee was great. Carmelita and Mary always made our day with their smiles. We spent our days at the pool and beach. The palapa umbrella reserving system was easy. Yes you need to set your alarm to 4 pm to remind yourself to reserve one but they still had plenty in the morning and best part is they are absolutely free. We had pool side lunch a few times and was great. The Kadushi Juice Bar was my fave and we had daily a\u00e7a\u00ed bowls and smoothies. Right next to the pool and beach you could n\u2019t ask for a better spot. Remember to bring your yeti type cup cause the Hyat has these great ice and water stations which were the best to keep hydrated. The Hyat has so much fun activities for our family. We loved the daily fish feeding bingo with our fave guy johny and popsicle ice cream by the pool. We looked forward to the fun things they had for us. We did n\u2019t eat dinner at the Hyat but the restaurants looked nice. Since it was our first time in Aruba we wanted to explore at night. Everything is so close we had so many places within walking distance. Amazing location. Our room was always cleaned perfectly. We had an amazing view of the ocean pool. They had live music every night which was right outside our room. Even though it was a little loud we loved it. The staff at the Hyat never stops they are always cleaning the bathrooms pools and beach. They always greet you with smiles and hellos. I ca n\u2019t say enough good things about the staff they go above and beyond keeping everything perfect. We had the most amazing time and will definitely be back.

Heartbreaking to leave this review. I had read the reviews from December complaining about construction so I called within enough time to change my reservation and was assured several times that there was no longer any construction happening. I was specifically told they were just doing some finishing touches like painting and that by the time we arrived the adults only pool would be filled but may not be swimable yet. Even though we booked this hotel six months ago because we were promised that the adults only section would be open by December we decided to stick with this property since we had such a great experience the year prior. When we arrived the pool was absolutely nowhere near being filled or even finished. There is a giant plywood fence around the area and the construction noise began early in the morning and carried on all day. Buzz saws drilling trucks beeping loud banging the works. While our room was not overlooking the construction there were plenty of people all over the property complaining about theirs and the noise was unavoidable from the beach no matter how loud the music was. The spa is nonexistent. They booked our services in the lobby not saying a word about what was going on and leading us to believe that we would be taken to the spa when we got our massages. When we reported to the lobby at our appointment time we were escorted to a hotel room with massage tables set up. Since we were a couple they did our massages in the same room even though we had not booked and did not want. a couples massage. They discounted the massages by twenty dollars but it was still over 300 spent on massages that we never would have booked in the first place had we been told the truth. I genuinely felt bad for the manager who I witnessed getting yelled at by angry customers every day throughout our weeklong stay. Not wanting to make a scene I called twice to ask to speak to someone about what was going on and was assured someone would get back to me. No one ever did. When American Express called on my behalf the phone line for travel agents was disconnected. Obviously some super genius in corporate thought it would be a good idea to just lie to people about what was happening so that they could continue to charge a full rate at peak season but being lied to is a surefire way to keep me away from visiting again. This is really a shame because the housekeeping staff in this hotel is impeccable the beach and wait staff are wonderful. Shout outs to Nancy in housekeeping Jefrie Augie Juan on the beach pool team and waiters Roberto and Bert. They made our stay at the Hyat redeemable. They took our experience personally and did everything they could to distract us from what was going on.

We spent almost two weeks at this gorgeous property. Pros Extremely clean rooms with daily nightly servicing which was outstanding. Not a spot missed. Rooms are mostly renovated and beautiful. We had a suite with a full balcony so we were able to enjoy the beautiful view Staff are all excellent. Front desk management and grounds were very interactive with staff with many knowing us by name by day two. They go above and beyond to ensure you are happy enjoying yourselves and nothing is too much to ask of anyone. Beach staff work very hard and we highly recommend tipping them. Pol is gorgeous and clean. We prefer the upper pool as it was quieter and not so many loud crowds playing volleyball or boozing. The lower pool is nice but it does have a bit of a spring break atmosphere at times. Nevertheless all gorgeous. Waterslide was a big hit and fun for all. Chair umbrella reservation system is great. No need to wake up early on vacation to secure a chair. You do it online. We first booked and paid. however by day 3 we would simply go online at 4 pm and secure a free spot. Never any issues whatsoever. Except when someone took our towels and chairs but staff were very kind to advise this lady about the reservation system and provided fresh towels. Proximity to shops restaurants is excellent. In fact you feel worlds away from the chaos in this oasis but if needed you simply walk out for a change of scenery. We dined outside the Hyat most of the nights as the restaurants on site are menh and service was mediocre at best at the Palm. ConsThe property is UNDER RENOVATIONS. This was not mentioned to us upon booking or check in and we we placed directly above the construction. This was not acceptable and it took a lot of effort for management to address it. Although we were gone mostly in the daytime the noise was still there early in the morning waking us up. and early evening. At over 1 K a night guests should be warned of this. Non guests using the facilities occured on a daily basis. They would walk in slip into the pools and then grab a towel on the chair and then leave. Security should really increased their guests only policy. Hyat does not have the bracelet system. Perhaps implement it. They were very strict at the adults only pool. Follow the same rules for the rest of the propertyOur room also overlooked the two jacuzis. The first week we were woken up several times at night from drunk partiers in the jacuzi. It never closes so guests can use this anytime which is fine but should respect that at 40 am not everyone wants to hear screaming shouting and cursing outside their room. Security came a few times to advise them. This problem was ongoing and we did not sleep for the first week thanks to these spring breakers. Close the jacuzi at 11 pm PERIODWe witnessed two guys walk directly off the boardwalk at 11 pm slip into the jacuzi do their thing and then walk out. Non guests. We refused to go in the jacuzi since. Lastly now that the adult pool is open please allow the upper pool to open for all guests to enjoy. There is a sign indicating no balls fun horseplay etc. One returning guest woman with way too many hair clips in her hair would scold kids for anything. She acted like security for that pool and crossed the line a few times. I guess she sensed that she was entitled being a return guests and all but we too pay the fees to stay at this propertly and kids ARE ALLOWED in that pool. Now that the adults only pool is open those types of guests should make their way to that pool. Unles they can not afford the umbrella rental at the adult pool. Overall great property that will be wonderful once construction is done and over and they deal with noise at night. We look forward returning.", "offset": [667, 768], "date": "2020-03-14", "cpt": "1", "category": "fitness"}]}
