We stayed at the Welk Resort Palm Springs Desert Oasis twice for two weeks each time summer of 2014 and April 2015. The suite was roomy and comfortable on the whole. The bedroom and living area were separate rooms with a television in each. We appreciated the full kitchen which we used frequently. The king bed was comfortable so comfortable that we kept its features in mind when we replaced our mattress at home. My wife has breathing problems at times the upholstered furniture in the living room gave her a comfortable sleep sitting up when she needed it. Our view each time was of a parking lot. That was both a blessing and a minor issue. The blessing was that we could park close to the building. We stayed on the second floor the first time and the first floor in April. As other reviewers have said the only way to get to the second floor other than the stairs is a lift that runs very slowly. We adjusted our expectations and happily used it a lot. But we found it much more convenient to stay on the first floor. One advantage was that we could transport luggage into and out of the room using the patio door. Our car was usually parked only a few feet away. Be aware that the patio door has a different lock than the front door so someone has to go in through the hall for entrance and egress. We used the free Wi Fi frequently and found poor reception mostly late at night. Daytime connectivity seemed fine. The complex has two pools a fairly large one for families with children and a small lap pool for adults only. We used the adult pool several times and found it more than adequate. The grounds are spacious and well maintained. I spent time several days photographing the view of mountains and sunsets from the paved path on the perimeter. On the whole we enjoyed the facilities. Special events involving food and the small polside caf\u00e9 were something else. We tried a couple of barbeque events in the summer. The food was rationed and not particularly well prepared. The price seemed higher than many restaurants in the area. Social events including food nights seemed to be designed for families with children more than an older couple. We decided that this did not have to be a problem as we could avoid those events and use the full kitchen when we did not want to go out. We used the polside caf\u00e9 mostly for sodas as we found that the service was incredibly slow for anything else. We did appreciate its availability on warm afternoons including lots of tables in the shade. But as others have said it closes early. At check in and in the room we were encouraged to eat at the restaurant in the golf course clubhouse. We thought about it a few times in our first visit but no one could tell us for certain when it was open. This is the off season so they are not open as much. When we called we found that they did not offer anything to interest us in the summer. When we returned in April we decided to try the Sunday Brunch which had been mentioned in the advertising. Our brother and sister in law were to be our guests as they had rented a suite for the weekend. We arrived at the clubhouse during advertised hours at least two hours before it was scheduled to close. The restaurant looked like a nice place but no one was there. Not only no patrons no staff were visible. There were quite a few brunch items set up but the warming dishes had no flame underneath to keep the food warm. The sound of my voice suggesting that we try another place brought two staff people into the room. They obviously had responsibilities elsewhere and covered the brunch as a sideline. Warming trays were lit and after a while omelets made to order. The food was adequate but I have tasted much better in other Sunday brunches. One staff person disappeared and reappeared occasionally throughout our stay trying to make us or himself comfortable with casual conversation a few times. It seemed more intrusive than inviting. When the check was delivered I was amazed. More than 80 for four people. I realized that no one and no advertising had mentioned a price. A well prepared and served brunch in an elegant setting would be worth more than 20 per person but a golf course clubhouse with no staff assigned to the brunch. Nevertheless I paid it without protest. Or thought I would pay. It turned out that no one in the clubhouse knew how to process a credit card. it is almost the end of our season and the person who does this is not here. They asked me to sign for it and promised that it would be processed later. It was. A special and much desired visit with our in laws was almost ruined by this experience. My conclusion the facilities on the whole are nice. They are not up to Mariot standards but we did not pay Mariot prices. We had not expected that level. We were comfortable in both suites. Housekeeping service was outstanding. They were always polite and seemed to enjoy their work. Once a day a person would stop to empty our garbage containers but do not disturb signs were always respected. The resorts much advertised food facilities and events however left a lot to be desired. If we were to return for a third visit a remote possibility as we are more likely to vacation in other communities we would plan to enjoy the suite and pool nothing else.", "offset": [4656, 4707], "date": "2015-05-10", "cpt": "0", "category": "atmosphere"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "ba84d434-4240-41c3-aa67-4f79f36667c5", "sentence": "excellent apartment villas.

We chose this place for it is central location as we were visiting elderly relatives in Banning and Palm Desert. Although not ultra modern in this spacious two room suite everything was functioning bed was very comfortable and we were on the upper floor only two levels high. The spacious south facing balcony overlooked the golf course and the mountains and had sun virtually all day and hardly any noise from the surroundings. The grounds were well maintained and the two pools were of a good size and reasonably warm. There is a snack bar bar by the polside lounging area. Sun loungers are good quality and free towels are issued from the games room which also has pool tables and table tennis. The reception area is very welcoming and there is free coffee in the foyer in the mornings. All the staff were very helpful and cheery. I played a few rounds of golf on the adjacent course which was in reasonably good condition considering the time of year. I was on a few occasions scooping small roaches up and throwing them outside it is a hot climate and the room is not hermetically sealed you can not prevent this at all times we take the conditions as they come.
