Just returned from 5 days and 4 nights in Key West staying at the Parrot Key. This resort hotel is not a five star property so do not go there expecting five star service or amenities. Know what it is before booking. Recommend you check out oystercom for real pictures of this resort and an accurate description. Really liked that the resort property is all non smoking. Now for my review. The Room We stayed in a garden view family suite room 62B which put us on the second and third floors so be prepared to carry luggage up two flights of steps. The single room 62A is on the first floor so if that is what you are booking then no stairs and you get front and back entrance ie you can get directly to the pools. The family suites only have one access door. The pictures on oystercom and the web site show exactly what our suite was. It was more than adequate for our family of four with two college age kids. The daily maid service came at different times depending on the number of checkouts that day one day was 430. another was 120 another was 20. The beds are clean and comfortable the towels are nice and there were three TVs in our family suite. The dry bar breakfast nook area was adequate enough but the refrigerator is just a tiny cube and should be a larger size. There were 8 10 individual coffees and plastic plates and silverware in the drawers. A sink in the dry bar breakfast nook would be nice but oh well. The Pools Having four pools was nice. They are heated and clean. There were rarely ever more than 5 6 people at pools 3 and 4. Pool 1 which is beside Cafe Blue is the busiest. You need to know the pools are shady due to the tall trees all around. If you want to stay in the sun you must move from chair to chair throughout the day. The resort really needs to trim back some of the vegetation around at least one or two of the pools to give a sunny pool option. is not sun what people want when sitting at the pool. Each pool has a bathroom facility which was clean. You check out towels at the Cafe. Occasionally someone comes around to see if you want something from the bar. Cafe Blue The on site restaurant is limited and expensive as is the bar for drinks. Breakfast and lunch sandwiches are 10 and most of the drinks are 10 11. Breakfast is served until noon so you can not get any lunch items until after 120. There are much better options nearby for food than the Cafe. Workout Room The exercise room is very small. It has 2 treadmills 1 elliptical 1 bike and a set of dumbbell free weights and bench. At 100 to 10 when I went there I was the only person but earlier in the morning it was full and people came in and just left. The resort really should have better exercise facilities. Water Sports Sunset Water Sports has one of their outfits on property. They offer paddle boards kayaks and jet skies at the Parrot Key facility. The guys that run it are great and we thought having this option right at Parrot Key is a big plus for the resort. We did paddle boards for an hour one afternoon a good workout and did the jet ski tour around the island one afternoon. If you want some excitement and you do not mind going fast on the water the jet ski tour is a must. Even in January it is not too cold for the jet ski tour. General Observations and Recommendations. The resort is a good distance from the Old Town area and all the activities around Duval Street. It really is too far to walk but Key West has many taxis. We flew right into Key West and used taxis to get everywhere. You do not need a car in Key West. We talked to one couple who spent 75 to park their car in Old Town for a few hours. A taxi from the resort to Duval St is 450 per person each way. We spent 40 each day on taxi fare. The taxi from airport to resort is 8 per person. Having a Walgrens next door and a Wyn Dixie across the street it is at the back of the shopping plaza is great for purchasing everything you need for breakfast and lunch. Mr Z pizza is right across the street and their pizza is terrific and they will deliver right to your resort door. They did mess up one of our lunch items one day and apparently that is a normal ocurance. There is also a chinese takeout and bagel shop across the street as well as 5 Guys and Dominos pizza. These are much better options nearby for eating breakfast or lunch than at the resort cafe. Make sure you are going to Old Town for lunch andor dinner because there are hundreds of options. Key West is not a tropical beach vacation destination. Go to the Caribean or Mexico if that is what you want. If you want to stay within the US and enjoy 75 80 degree weather in January with water temps that are warm enough to enjoy water activities Key West is a nice option. Key West is a great place to eat drink and party. My 20 year old daughter said Key West is not much fun if you are under 21 and can not enjoy all that Old Town and Duval has to offer. Many of the Duval St bars and restaurants have live music. There are many places to enjoy craft beers The Porch Joes Tap Room Krawel Off Duval World Of Beers are some recommendations. The girls did go to Smathers beach one afternoon and had a nice time. The resort offers a free shuttle to Smathers at 10 12 2 and 4 and with your room key you get a free beach chair. Hope this helps you understand both Parrot Key resort and Key West. Just know that everything in Key West is a little more expensive than back home. Overall we had a nice wintertime family vacation to Key West and we are glad we stayed at Parrot Key.", "offset": [2071, 2147], "date": "2015-01-09", "cpt": "0", "category": "restaurant"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "c70fec2f-4b58-4d59-84a7-d270b1b84f95", "sentence": "We stayed in a 2bedrom suite.

We were very disappointed in our stay. One of the main reasons we chose this property was due to the fact that they advertised Nobody under 25 years old was allowed to check in or be about the resort unescorted by someone 25 or older. They also advertised about the quietness of the rooms due to the fact that there were no hallways. The place had seemingly as many children running around wild as DisneyWorld. There was constant screaming of kids unattended for the most part. Kids riding skateboards terrorizing other guests trying to use the narrow walkways and young children taking over all of the four pool areas. There was not a peaceful area to be found. The no hallways claim appeared to be true BUT they fail to mention that you share a brezeway with the upstairs room which had wild kids. They were constantly runung up and down the stairs jumping up and down and generally having a bang up time. We finally had to call security one night at 1045 pm because it was so loud. The staff was very nice but a little uninformed of what their website had advertised. One case in particular we foung through the website a private dinner tour that was offered on a 33 foot boat. When we checked in we inquired about it and nobody seemed to have a clue what we were talking about. The next day I asked the concierge about it and he had never heard of it either. The peace and quiet advertised were never found. We were extremely disappointed in Parrot Key. The staff was friendly Key West was a fun town. The wave runner ride was a blast.

I had expected this resort to be on an actual beach but discovered that is not really how things work in Key West. Coming from Australia I guess I assumed that there were beaches all over the Keys but it is really just land and then water with no gap in between. However this resort is very nice well laid out with very cute townhouse style apartments surrounding the central pool area. There are three pools with a bar restaurant at the one end which does good cocktails and decent food for a reasonable price. there is plenty of parking if you are driving to the Keys. there is a Walgrens next door so you can stock up on snacks or drinks or in our case right before Hurricane Matthew arrived gallons of water. The hotel has a shuttle which goes down to Duval Street at regular intervals. Things were not all perfect at the Parrot Key but the staff did seem keen to resolve our issues so we appreciated that. The main issues being lights not working probably just due to light bulbs blowing and not being replaced and the key cards constantly crapping out so keys had to be re set.

Firstly the resort is quaint and we really enjoyed our time around the little pools. We had breakfast at the pool a couple of times and everything was great. Our only complaints would firstly be the check in process. We arrived after a long drive I jumped out of the car to check us in but because I had booked the room in my husbands name they refused to check me in and insisted without much grace that I would have to send my husband in. There was nowhere to park the car so we had to park across the road so he could go back and check us in. I have never experienced this in many years of travel. Secondly we booked a 2 bedroom suite as a treat to have a separate room from our two younger children. When I booked the room I also remember seeing pictures of a white sand area with chairs in front of the room and thought the children would enjoy this. When we arrived there was a very steep set of stairs to even get up to the room which was very difficult for us to get our bags up as we were a family of 4 with luggage for a 7 day trip. That aside the second bedroom or kids bedroom was up on a second level again a very very steep set of stairs. This was not a usable room for us as my children sometimes wake in the night and it would be far too dangerous for them to make their way down these stairs. I rang reception but they were unable to move us. I asked if they had a child gate to at least prevent them from accessing the stairs in the night but they showed no interest in wanting to help. I ended up having to make a bed with cushions from the sofa and have them camp on the floor in the living room. I wish I had not paid extra for the 2 bedroom room as we were unable to use it.

There are no comfortable chairs in the room and no table space to eat on. The LOcitane bath products were nice. It was very nice with no room to room noise or noise in the resort. We were greeted with sangia which was nice. At 5 pm the bought drinks to the pool and passed them out. The only food available on site was the pool bar which had hamburgers a few sandwiches quesidilas salads. There was a Denys Dominos and Papa Johns across the street othersise you had to take a cab to eat. If you want a nice relaxing vacation this is the place.

We booked our stay at Parrot Key online with no prior knowledge of this resort or even Key West in general. We booked a one bedroom ocean view suite but upon arrival were given a two bedroom suite. I assume the one bedrooms were sold out but it was interesting that I was not told of the change at the front desk but only discovered it when we entered the room. The view was excellent and the suite huge even discounting the second bedroom upstairs. We occupied the second and third floor so we did not have direct beach access as the first floor unit did but the view more than made up for that and we were comfortable sleeping with our door open. One must use the room key to pass through two doors to enter the suite so the security was quite good. There were two balconies one off of the bedroom facing the water and the other off of the living room facing into the resort. The staff at the reception desk when we arrived were not particularly friendly or informative but not rude either. Other times we spoke to different personnel they were very helpful. All of the rest of the resort personnel were quite friendly and helpful. The rooms were well cleaned each day. In our opinion the food at the Caf\u00e9 Blue restaurant was not really very good although the staff were very friendly so we chose to not eat there after our first experience. Next door and across the street are a CVS Win Dixie grocery and liquor stores and a few restaurants all of which were very handy. The on site water activity area was great and very convenient. It is reviewed separately under Sunset Watersports. There are several pools including one for adults only and one next to Caf\u00e9 Blue and the bar. The pools never felt crowded and we did meet several friendly guests while hanging out there. There are lots of cats on the property which was really cool. There is a beach area note that the ocean is not accessible here or anywhere else at the resort. that was quite nice with hammocks beach chairs and a small pier from where many people watched the sunsets. Because this is away from Duval Street it was quiet and relaxing. The shuttle to Duval was well run and made getting there and back very easy. My only complaint other than wishing the on site food was better was that the guests on either side of us felt the need to keep their porch lights on most of the night even though they were not even out there and the decks were upstairs so not particularly vulnerable. This made sitting out there less enjoyable. Not the fault of the hotel of course.

The 4 pool areas are so pretty surrounded by trees and quirky features there were always sun beds available. The restaurant was more of a snack bar but was good quality for breakfast or lunch not so much for dinner but an uber into Duval street was only about 13.

I had noticed other reviews where they had commented on this and thought it sounded quite trivial but it actually is quite annoying. On the first few days it was fine but then for the rest of our stay they started turning up in the late afternoon. early evening anywhere from 4 6pm just at the time you are returning to the villa to relax get ready to go out it actually became quite irritating to just step into the shower have housekeeping knocking at the door. We just started leaving the do not disturb sign up when we returned. Also Reception need to warn people about the current seaweed issue on Smathers Beach they offer a free shuttle sun beds while obviously we know it \u2019s completely out of anyone \u2019s control they failed to mention the unbearable smell. We visited briefly while driving past imagine a combination of rotten eggs fish. We were fortunate that the shuttle driver warned us before we set off as otherwise it would have been a wasted morning. However it was an amazing hotel and we would definitely highly recommend.", "offset": [1175, 1329], "date": "2019-08-03", "cpt": "2", "category": "restaurant"}, {"id": 28, "uid": "ba98a88a-359e-44d4-8038-bed24a117d4e", "sentence": "Excellent Hotel.
