Rooms are divided into harbour tower being the least expensive marina tower bayview tower and waterfront being the higher prices. The hotel is nice. My problem was that we checked in the staff try to sell you upgrades at the front desk I decided to upgrade to the waterfront tower went into the room it looked as though someone slept on the bed and the room was dirty. I downgraded to the Marina tower again the same thing. I finally got a room in the bayview tower that was clean. Each time I went down to the front desk and complained no one bothered to apologize or to even acknowledge what I was saying. They just kept telling me Okay the new room cost will be this amount and as usual no manager was available or so they claimed. One hour later after struggling with my luggage from tower to tower I got a room. This was very aggravating for me. The staff really does not seem to care about you.

The Chilean Sea Bass was delicious but a small serving for the price. Filet Mignon topped with Lump Crab was out of the ball park.

I was shocked that Harahs has gone so downhill. I had not been there in exactly two years and this was an awful homecoming to a place I used to visit three times a year. The rooms we had three rooms in the Harbour tower were dirty with stains on the floors one looked like blood and very unpredictable air conditioning in all three rooms. The bathroom door in one room could not open all the way because it hit the toilet at the halfway mark. The beds were all mismatched and maybe just too old and over used not at all comfortable and we could hear every room around us flushing all night. The cafe tazo place messed up our orders for breakfast both mornings. The highlight was dinner at martoranos food was great but they told me they had no more high chairs available for my one year old. I very nicely told the waitress that is not ok and she must have gone to another restaurant to borrow one and came in with it hosed off and soaking wet.
