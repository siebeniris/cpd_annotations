The room was not big but there was enough room for me to move around the ceiling to floor Windows was what won me over. I also went to the spa the staff were super friendly and I instantly fell in love with the spa. The guy who did my manicure was friendly and very talkative I enjoyed our conversations and the lady who gave me a Swedish massage was very skilled. The second time I stayed in The Borgota my friend and I stayed in the fiore suite for one day and in a classic room in The Water club for the second day. The fiore suite was beautiful I loved how elegant the bath room was there is a shower stall a bath a separate room for the toilet and a small desk with a chair where you can put your makeup on. The room it self could have been bigger but can not complain the bed was comfortable as well the view was stellar and it was definitely an upgrade. But I enjoyed staying in the water club even more than the Borgota. The room was very retro looking which I appreciated and I felt like the classic bathroom in the water club was nicer and more decorative than the classic bathroom in the Borgota. Room service was crazy expensive I ordered a sandwich and my friend ordered a phily cheese steak and it came up to like 60 USD. It was pretty convenient staying in the water club because they have a wine store down stairs which I went to to get some wine and they also have a pool with a bar. I got a spa package that was supposed to cost 260 but because of taxes and fees they hiked it up to 350. The package came with a 50 minute massage a facial and a lux manicure. Do NOT get it it is not even worth the price. The young woman who gave me the massage was very talkative I did not mind but it is kind of hard to enjoy a massage when there is so much talking. she gave me a great massage nevertheless. The person who gave me a facial was pretty quiet she popped my pimples and put a protein mask on my face which caused me to break out a lot the next day. unles you buy the products that they use on you the facial will only cause you to break out and the person who gave me the manicure did not really do a good job seeing how the paint on my nails started to chip off after 3 hours. My suggestion is Stay in either the Fiore suite or a classic room in the water club. And DO NOT get the spa package it is better if you just get what you want individually because you pay less. ALSO unles you have a black card you will be pretty pissed off by the long lines to anything.", "offset": [236, 331], "date": "2016-05-21", "cpt": "0", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 5, "uid": "e79e0ae4-636f-454a-b67b-33c920a47091", "sentence": "FABULOUS SPA.

My brother made an online room reservation for me. It was not a comp room he just used his rewards card. He did not have to be here to check us in he just needed to let the hotel know that I would be checking in. The managers kept saying he needed to make a note on the account when he reserved the room but when you reserve online there is nowhere to make a note. He needed to call Borgata and let them know which to me that defeats the whole purpose of doing something online. I could not check in bc they needed verification from him saying the room was for me. They would not accept the email from him to me about the room. They had to speak to him but not the people at the desk he had to call a different number. What. Why are you people trying to complicate things and piss me off. Meanwhile I can not get a hold of my brother bc he is camping with the kids. For a half hour they stare at me and tell me there is nothing they can do. I am like so he paid for this room and he will not be here and you are going to keep his money. That does not make sense to me. And they keep saying yes bc he is the only one who can check in bc he did not leave a note on the account. WTFAfter 45 minutes I suggest they cancel his reservation and give me his room. Oh ok we can do that. They do that and charge me 150 MORE. Are you serious. If we were not seeing a show here I would have left. We finally get in and the room and I call the desk bc they never gave me anything in writing saying they canceled his reservation and credited his card. The girl who answers tells me that she just spoke to my brother. I tell her what happened and she reads the notes on the account and is like omg I can not believe they gave you such a hard time. Not once did they apologize or try to problem solve.

Attended Saturday night for a bachelorette party and we had reserved two rooms next door to each other. Check in was supposed to be at 4 pm and when returning from the pool at 430 we were told our rooms were still not ready. 45 minutes later we were told only one room was ready. We had 8 girls who needed to get ready for a 730 dinner reservation. We decided to go up to the room that was ready to at least have a place to sit. Upon having our bags sent to our room we were harased by a bellhop that we needed to open our bags because they felt too heavy and must have alcohol in them. Since that is invading our privacy we did not agree and were told security would have to come check our luggage. He told the front desk we had boxes of open wine and beer in our room which was even close to true. Not only did we not have alcohol with us we had just literally just walked into our room. At 6 pm we still had not received our 2nd room and when going to the bell services to check on it we were given a condescending attitude by Kevin who said our room was still not ready and the security issue was a priority. Security coming or not coming is not the reason why our room was still not ready 2 hours later. After complaining again Kevin magically gave us another room on that floor that I am sure had been available for quite some time. We were told we could have a 12 pm check out but were not compensated any further for not having anywhere to go and barely making our reservation on time. Cleaning services knocked on our door at 930am the next day to begin cleaning funny how we can start cleaning that room before even normal check out but we can not get a room cleaned for 2 hours to check in.
