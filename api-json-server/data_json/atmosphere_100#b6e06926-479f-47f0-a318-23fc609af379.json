Walk to restaurants shops the pier historic buildings. can not be beat. Giant open lobby with a nice restaurant and our room was lovely clean bathrobes nice toiletries etc. The only less than ideal aspects are 1 the hotel is very very spread out and there is only one bank of elevators. For anyone with mobility issues this could be a challenge and 2 the rooms are not air conditioned. Yes this is Monterey so the room could be kept at a comfortable temperature by keeping the sliding glass door open there is a screen. however sea gulls are REALLY loud and on occasion so are guests using the patios of nearby rooms. All that being said should we have an occasion to return to Monterey we had probably stay here again. We used the valet parking and they were prompt each time we called for the car. Friendly desk staff etc. and we felt the price was reasonable.", "offset": [235, 348], "date": "2015-07-14", "cpt": "0", "category": "atmosphere"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "bcccdfa4-1034-4115-93b6-cd5c8a65dc1f", "sentence": "Seems like it was a nice hotel once. Hard to know if my somewhat negative reaction is to the Monterey vibe in general or the hotel in particular. Room was a little worn down and interiors dated particularly for the cost. We were able to book an adjoining parlor room which made our small room into a generous suite. Staff seemed less than enthusiastic but provided service as needed. Location is great if you are into Fishermans Wharf. Tourist crowd is just generally not very sophisticated. And do not get a room facing into the plaza unles you have earplugs festival outside sounds like it is happening in our second floor room. Public restrooms in lobby made me think I would never host a wedding here unles you had like your guests to have to wait in line and use a shabby bathroom.", "offset": [37, 145], "date": "2015-09-06", "cpt": "0", "category": "atmosphere"}, {"id": 2, "uid": "8976c8c2-8ecc-458d-9686-84db0df50db5", "sentence": "Very Over Priced No Value for the Dollar.

The beds are very very comfortable. I think the under construction aspect of the hotel should be highlighted more on the webpage. I have stayed at The Portola before and was expecting the same excellent experience but I was very disappointed. I felt like I was driving down a sidewalk into a construction zone and then having to carry our bags across the plaza to check in only to be told our rooms were back across the plaza above the parking garage well it did not start off our experience in a terribly positive light. When I showered this morning the tiles in the shower were uneven and hurt my feet. I did not know showering could actually be painful. It actually took away the pleasure of a nice hot shower. We were also very confused and concerned about the in and out with the parking garage. There was an attendant one time out of the 4 times we were in and out. We were told to take our room keys when we checked out but there was no place to turn them in and no attendant on duty when we checked out and left this morning. Very confusing and poor security on cars going in and out. Also when trying to checkout using the tv one room said no one was in that room so checkout was unavailable. The maid walked into the room while my daughter was getting dressed because the system had already checked her out without her doing anything. Hopefully the charges will be correct on my credit card. I spent about 80 for one night for 3 rooms I expected a better overall experience for my money.

We stayed at this establishment with high hopes for a great hotel but we did not get what we expected. When we checked in to the hotel we went to our room directly and fell asleep as we had a long day of driving that day from los angeles scenic route the soft beds allured us towards them. We fell asleep instantly to be woken up five minutes later by a loud car driving by we thought that by being on a room on the fifth floor that this would not be a problem we then looked outside and saw that our fifth floor room was not that high up. That added to the long walk from the elevators made us want to change rooms when we asked we were offered two rooms the first on the same placement on the 6th floor and one on the third floor closer by. With the noise on the fifth floor we feared that the third floor would be noisier and the long walking distance on the 6th we chose to save time and not move. We then went to tell people about the experience and realized there was no free wifi and it cost 995 a day at 2 Mbps ridiculous huh. Especially because the restaurant we went to had free wifi. My dad then came up and told us about 19 a night SELF PARKING not valet which is 22 a night absolutely ridiculous.

My husband and I stayed here for our 25th wedding anniversary arriving around 1030 pm after two flights. I had arranged with the concierge to have a bottle of wine and a fruit and cheese plate waiting on our room on arrival which we got to enjoy outside on our balcony. The lobby is beautiful with live trees throughout and the room was clean and comfortable. The hotel is right by Fishermans Wharf and the bike pedestrian path along the water. Cannery Row is walkable but I preferred biking there. We were able to rent bikes at Adventures by the Sea right there at the Portola. We had an excellent stay but the pool and hot tub had lots of active children jumping in and out and we wanted more of a romantic scene instead of a family one.
