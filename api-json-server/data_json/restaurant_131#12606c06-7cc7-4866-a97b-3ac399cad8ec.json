Again business men do not care because they are going to expense it but tourists why should you pay for water when you can not drink the tap water anywhere in Ukraine. This is not just unfair it should be illegal making you pay for safe drinking water. We walked 2 blocks past a burned out apartment building to a regular supermarket to get a 1galon jug of water for 120EUR. The gym is small but adequate. The transportation service was very reliable prompt and friendly but expensive. Breakfast was 20EUR. Why would anyone pay for this except businessmen. Breakfast in Ukraine is otherwise very inexpensive and there were 5 or 6 coffee shops within less than half a block not all cheap but most. Metro is a short and pleasant walk.

The Radison Blu sounded promising a four star hotel at little more than half the price of the nearby five star hotels with a location that was almost as convenient to sights and the metro. Our room was modern immaculate and in excellent repair with a comfortable king size bed abundant closet space and an in room safe. The bathroom was well equipped with ample vanity space. Our sixth floor room was quiet with minimal traffic noise despite bring on the street side. The WiFi was fast and easy to use. Our rate included the breakfast buffet which was comprehensive and well staffed although some of the staff seemed inexperienced eg clearing plates prematurely. We were delighted that our room was available despite our arrival at 930 AM. Other guests might not be so fortunate but this was a huge plus for us. All of this would lead me to give the Radison an \u201c excellent \u201d rating but there were annoyances. A small one. unlike most competing hotels in Kyiv the Radison quotes rates without taxes which are only added in at checkout resulting in misleading comparison shopping. But the much more significant problem is that the lobby of the hotel is undergoing major renovation. The absence of a lobby was not the problem what seemed to be the breakfast area was pressed into service as a small reception space with boxes of supplies on the floor breakfast was instead served in the restaurant space. The issue was construction noise which started at 9 AM and was continuing when we returned from dinner at 830 PM on a Sunday. In addition a circuitous path through the construction zone was required to access the elevator see photos with two of three being inaccessible to guests. That the hotel was being renovated with construction extending into the evening hours clearly should have been disclosed on the hotel website.
