Well I am so disaponted in the Sheraton. Back in December i made arrangements to give my daughter and her husband a special birthday weekend and I did it early so it would be wonderful.

I got them tickets for Cirque du soleil and paid for a parking ticket since your front desk said their were no shuttles to take them really they were lined up 10 deep. Then they got to room nice room even though I asked for the king they had doubles but front desk did catch that and they got King. They picked up phone for room service and no phone after they asked for my daughters credit card. She went down to front desk waited half hour and still no phone she went down again because can not call front desk with no phone working. Again was told it would be taken care of. They went to show came back no phone still and now its cold and heater does not work either. Had to go DOWN to front desk again and front desk allowed them to use a phone for room service which did not come for hour and 11 at night. Maintenance man came could not fix phone or heater. Said he would be back never showed up again. My daughter was getting over end of flu had to sleep in coat. Oh front desk said they would comp food however. never saying sorry. and when they went to leave they charged my daughter card for parking 260 so they made their money on food. and I would have paid had I known.", "offset": [497, 627], "date": "2020-02-22", "cpt": "1", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 16, "uid": "51829098-0d4a-4c9e-85f5-0b10786a2b99", "sentence": "Most uncomfortable \u201c upgrade \u201d ever.
