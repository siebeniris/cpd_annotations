Unles another conference or meeting is held at this location I probably would not return to this hotel. While the convenience of staying at the Crowne Plaza was great while attending the conference in held in the meeting rooms the hotel was a little disappointing. I reserved 4 rooms for myself and my colleagues and had confirmed the information on Friday prior to check in on Sunday. Upon arrival we had difficulty checking in since the reservation had been split into multiple confirmation numbers which was unknown to me since I was only given and sent one confirmation number by the reservations folks. The front desk staff figured out the issue but seemed aggravated when they told me I could have two rooms and I insisted that I needed the 4 rooms which I had reserved and confirmed. One of my colleagues was given a room which was co located the HVAC exhaust duct for the entire building making the room very noisy. When asked if there was anything that could be done the front desk staff first told him that he was not checked in though the person who checked him in was at the next computer then sent a housekeeping person with a plunger. Eventually another maintenance person showed up and offered to apply duct tape to a door but that was the only resolution to the issue. Also the 4 rooms reserved were all reserved at the same rate at the same time only 2 of the 4 rooms came with breakfast even though the confirmation email stated breakfast was included with all 4. Other smaller issues we observed included full trash cans in the rooms upon check in lack of cleaning in a shower upon check in and the fact that the water in the shower never really go hot no matter how long it ran. The WiFi was also a bit unreliable and when the front desk was asked if there may be a password or network issue we were told it was probably just a problem with all of our devices. With these disappointing points there was definitely some positive things too. The lobby was very nice and clean. The service at the downstairs bar was great very friendly and quick. The meeting facilities were very nice and the catering both the food and the personnel was spectacular. The shuttle service to the surrounding area was a great amenity to take advantage of. I travel frequently for business and while this did not rate is an extremely bad experience I think with a little better customer service I may had kept this on the list of places I would return.", "offset": [660, 842], "date": "2016-02-04", "cpt": "0", "category": "room"}, {"id": 3, "uid": "e190a0a0-ac98-41d6-8234-b06b06139c08", "sentence": "The rooms look great but the bathroom is subpar.

This hotel was recommended by a local business owner who was sponsoring a conference we were attending so I did not look at TripAdvisor first. Big mistake. I was completely blindsided by the incidentals charge at check in. This charge is not plainly disclosed anywhere on their site that I can find although they tell you upfront about the fee for early departure and the fee for valet park. This charge was 40 per day which was a lot of money for us that we had not budgeted. It was released on check out. although it was not removed from my credit card until 3 days after we left I checked my account every day to monitor. What was even more aggravating to me was that no one could tell me what this charge was supposed to be for. One staff member said it was in case I ordered room service. What. In this day of instantaneous charges why would not that go directly on my bill. Another staff member said people had been smoking in rooms and they were charging everybody. Again what. We spent our two days there double checking that anything we asked for was not an incidental ie wake up call ice there are no ice machines on the floors and you have to either go down to the lobby to get it or ask room service to bring it. We did not even use the coffee and tea service provided in the room. This was not done to be petty 80 is a lot of money for us and we had not budgeted it. We had planned to get breakfast at the hotel because our conference started early each morning but this just put us off doing anything there except sleep in the room. The manager acts like this is a common practice but I have never before been hit by a daily charge for no concrete reason and I have stayed at nicer hotels than this one. That being said the hotel was easy to find and get into and out of. The lobby is beautiful. The room was clean and quiet and comfortable and everything worked although it was too cluttered with furniture to seem spacious. The staff we had contact with were uniformly very nice. It was close to the conference we were attending and we were able to get to the conference from the hotel on side roads and avoid the interstate and its heavy traffic which we liked. All in all for me the pluses of this property do not outweigh the sneaky gotcha of the incidentals charge. Yes it was refunded to me but I had to wait three days for it and had to wonder what on earth I might be charged for since no one on staff could give me a reasonable and consistent answer. I told the business owner and other local conference attendees and they said they would no longer recommend this property. it is not awful but there are quite a few other places in the area that are comparable and do not charge incidentals.", "offset": [1440, 1606], "date": "2016-05-19", "cpt": "0", "category": "room"}, {"id": 6, "uid": "c36552d6-fbab-404c-99bf-245f600233de", "sentence": "Guests Beware Mold Spores. The service at this hotel is excellent. Everyone from the general manager to the servers in the restaurant are engaged helpful and pleasant. My largest concern is health issues for guests staying at this hotel. I have stayed at this property for more than eight nights on two separate occasions. Given the current condition of the hotel I am surprised IHG does not require more strict standards considering this should be a flagship property close to the IHG corporate office in Atlanta. My main issues revolve around cleanliness HVAC air quality room product including carpets wall coverings furnishings and fixtures. The HVAC systems are old and do not circulate the air effectively in the guest rooms. This issue combined with the humidity in Atlanta has caused major mold issues especially in the guest bathrooms. On both occasions I visibly noticed mold spores in the bathrooms tiled backsplash and air vents. This hotel needs a complete renovation including new wall treatments artwork furnishings fixtures carpet and tile in the bathroom.
