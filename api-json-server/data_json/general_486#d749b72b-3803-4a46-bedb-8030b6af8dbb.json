Ended up here because our flight was delayed 29 hours and Scandinavian airlines gave us a voucher for this hotel. First we had to wait more than one hour for the shuttle to come to the airport only to find out that the hotel was very far away from the airport and not close to anything of importance. Once we got into the hotel we got a horrible room where the carpet had so many rolls in it that we tripped over while walking. Everything was dirty and the furniture were old and broken. The doors and walls were also very dented and dirty and broken. The bad had hair that was not ours. There were dirty napkins on the floor and the promised free wifi did not work at all. There was no way we would even sit in that bed let alone sleep in it so we had no other choice but checking out and finding another hotel on our own.", "offset": [444, 503], "date": "2015-05-28", "cpt": "0", "category": "general"}, {"id": 2, "uid": "8dcb7c21-565e-4060-88f3-6e5b72020e7a", "sentence": "Very Nice Comfortable Hotel. We enjoyed our stay in a very large comfortable suite. The hotel provides many amenities that were nice as well as having an excellent breakfast available in the Atrium plus lunch and dinner in their Lobby level restaurant and bar. The beds were very comfortable and there is plenty of room to unpack and spread out. There was a microwave and small refrigerator in the room. The noise from the atrium sometimes was a little loud but only for occasional short periods. The elevators were a bit slow and one was under repair during part of our visit. We also had a problem with the bathroom light burning out late at night and there is no other light in the bathroom. We had to call twice the next morning to get it replaced. Also the door lock to the room would not close from the outside without slamming it so the man who came to replace the bathroom light also replaced the door lock with one that worked well. The bathrooms could use some repairs andor updating. The door at the bottom on the inside was delaminating with some strips of the veneer pulling away from the door at the bottom. It also looked like the tub area could use some regrouting. Finally the bedroom could use some additional lighting as it was difficult to see in some parts of the room it particularly could use a light or floor lamp in the corner of the room on the window wall on the side with the TV. I had my suitcase in that corner and at night found it difficult to see when I needed something from the suitcase. To repack my suitcase the last evening I had to move it onto the bed so I could see more easily. That being said it is still a very nice room and it is certainly very affordable and an excellent value. We would definitely stay here again. It would be particularly good for a family with several children who could all stay in the same room comfortably.", "offset": [995, 1121], "date": "2015-08-30", "cpt": "0", "category": "general"}, {"id": 3, "uid": "1f5d85bd-2b99-4baf-9f46-63c309f5408d", "sentence": "Wyndham is OK.

Needs a little more details. I Stayed one night at Delta hotel in Glenview for the last minute weekend getaway. Because of all the festivals and weekend hotel rates in Chicago was outrageous and this place offered wonderful price compared to any other properties in greater Chicago area. At first I was surprised to see the size of room. It \u2019s spacious and huge. Every room is suite you get to have a separate living room with mini bar refrigerator which is very family friendly. I can see the hotel was recently renovated room was clean simple and modern. The only issue is bathroom. Even though living room and bedroom are quite spacious bathroom is small. Layout was designed to be packed especially with toilet and shower tub. Ventilation is not that great either so bathroom can be foggy and heat remains after hot shower. I prefer a good water pressure but shower had a low pressure. There \u2019re couple minor things I also noticed details are missing after remodeling. Bedroom ceiling and several spot \u2019s paint job was finished incomplete. Overall Mariot did a great job renovating this previous Wyndham hotel but it could \u2019ve been better with more details. I will stay again for longer trip in Chicago. Pros huge suite room family friendly quick check in good size of lobby friendly staff easy parking quiet hotel ideal for longer stay.
