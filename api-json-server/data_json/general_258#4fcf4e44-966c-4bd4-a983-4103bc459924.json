We stayed at The Orchard for 3 nights on our visit to Singapore. The MRT from the airport to orchard road is very easy and incredibly cheap. Make sure you exit through whelock place otherwise you will have a long walk around to the hotel should usually only take 5 10 minutes. The hotel is at the very end of Orchard road but very accessible and no noise disturbance in the room. The hotel feels a little distant from main attractions in Singapore but the MRT quickly links you with the cityWe booked the signature room as a special treat but were upgraded on arrival to the suite which was extremely generous of the hotel. The bed was super comfy and there were no complaints about the room or the setting. The pool area is very well kept and gym appeared large from our quick glance. With the signature rooms there is a club room to use and includes a bespoke breakfast which is part of the reason we paid extra. On the Friday we were told it was served on level 18 however Saturday it seemed to have packed up early. When we told the hotel staff they offered us the main buffet which was good too. when the same happened on Sunday we were disappointed we had missed the breakfast again as it had cleared up early but when complaining it turned out we were incorrectly informed and weekend club lounge is level 17.

And the staff starts asking about the bag I said it is of no importance as the bag looks like a merchandise bag and my room is much more important at the moment. The front office should focus on the current problem rather than the other as you guys can enter the room by yourselves to check while us guests can not get our room keys on our own. But hey it was really fast for the key to come. At first it was the housekeeper that came and I can see that he was shocked and said that they may have miscalculated the amount of rooms. Not long after the bellboy came to give us the key. Got the room we should have gotten. View is okay as it is facing apartments. We booked for a double bed though but we got a twin bed that is joined together. Not a big deal for me but for other guests the dent in the middle can be bothersome.

I initially had not planned to stay at Orchard Hotel as I was previously only looking at hotels within a certain budget. However while surfing the net a couple of days before my planned check in date I saw that the price for OH in town area was actually quite value for money. I ended up booking their Signature Deluxe room 460 for 2 nights from their Signature series whereby each room decor is uniquely different. From the start of our staycation the guest experience team ensured that my hubby and I had the most pleasant stay at OH. 1. Guest Experience Manager Ms Chin Choi Yen personally greeted us during our check in at the front desk and even wished my hubby a happy birthday I had booked the staycay to celebrate it. Another surprise came when we were told that we would be given a free upgrade to the Signature Premier room which was bigger and all the way up on the top level. Yet another surprise came shortly after we unpacked at our room Yen turned up personally carrying a birthday platter courtesy of OH. refer to pic. 2. OH is a 5min walk unsheltered to Shaw Lido which then conveniently links you to the rest of the malls in Orchard Road. However the hotel makes up for this small inconvenience by providing a huge umbrella in its rooms and by allowing guests 2 parking coupons per day which is considered a luxury for Singapore hotels. I did a check with some hotels prior to booking and a few in town area did not even provide free parking for guests much less 2 coupons. This was one of the pull factors that led me to book OH 3. On the 2nd day of my stay I realised that I needed a nail clipper urgently as I had forgotten to cut my nails at home needed nails short for a piano lesson that day. I quickly texted Yen hoping to just borrow one from her female staff she had given me her HP upon checking in but I had not expected to use it haha. In less than 10 min after I had texted she showed up at our room with a nail clipper courtesy of the Front Office Manager Mr Quam Kponton. He had actually gone to buy one for me. You can imagine our amazement at their hospitality. All in all we had an extremely pleasant stay at OH and I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone wishing to stay in the heart of the city. With more than 60 rooms available there would surely be a type for each and every budget. Just a disclaimer I am not a Millennium Hotels chain member nor related to any of the staff. I managed to chat with Mr Quam on the last day before leaving and got to know that the Signature series of rooms will be undergoing refurbishment in end 2019.
