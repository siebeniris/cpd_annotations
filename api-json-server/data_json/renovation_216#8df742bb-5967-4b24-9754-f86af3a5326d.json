Everything about the hotel is wonderful and every member of staff that we encountered was happy courteous and keen to help in any way they could. Daniel on the front desk deserves a particular mention for the check in process and immediately made us feel that we were going to enjoy our stay. Concierge service were excellent valet parking used for the hire car arranged by the concierge was efficient housekeeping always to a high standard including toiletries regularly replenished door staff always ready to greet with a smile. Rooms were not the largest but not bad for a city hotel and the space was used very efficiently. Bed was extremely comfortable and the harbour view simply stunning. We left the curtains open at night so that we could watch the sunrise over the bay and the Opera House. My only quibble would be the bathrooms which had a bath not used by us a separate smallish shower cubicle which could have been so much bigger without space being used for the bath and a single sink with very limited space for toiletries etc. Not enough of a quibble to spoil our stay at all but when it is time for a refurb maybe the design of the bathrooms could be looked at. Overall a wonderful hotel with high quality well trained staff who make everything run like clockwork. Thank you Four Seasons if we are lucky enough to return to Sydney we know where we will stay.", "offset": [1141, 1276], "date": "2015-04-14", "cpt": "0", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "878a4707-5433-4f9d-9c8f-5fa8fd36c917", "sentence": "Location Location Location. Great location walking distance to many highlights of Sydney. Very nice staff and atmosphere. Great service we received during our whole stay. Arrived 8 am to the hotel were informed hotel was fully booked and we would be given a room as soon as first guests checked out. Reception could also have said check in start 3 pm but did not. Got a free upgrade to a room with a fantastic view of the harbour bridge and Sydney opera house. Breakfast was fine not a huge buffet like in a similar Singapore hotel but spot on for a western selection priced at 42 aud. We visited during August which is winter time pool is heated to 26 C which is fine for a swim even the air temp is only 20c. Pool deck is very slippery and Jacuzi next to the pool need a bit maintenance that is the only 2 things that caught our attention which could be improved.

The best thing about this hotel is the location. We booked a junior suite as it had a view of the Sydney Harbour Bridge and the Opera House. The view was stunning you could not have asked for more. We arrived in the early morning after flying for 21 hours so were somewhat tired. We were organised enough to book massages at the hotels spa in the late morning which helped us to feel much better and the treatment was really good. However what lets this hotel down is the quality of the accommodation. It is dreadfully dated. The standard of our bathroom was certainly not in keeping with a a hotel of this rating or b a junior suite. The tiles in the shower were dirty and mouldy in places I would be embarrassed if this were in my guest bathroom at home. The bathroom only has one sink and not a very well designed area around it so there is not enough room for toiletries etc without it looking messy. The breakfast is very average. As a non dairy and non gluten eater I found the choices very limited. I am sure if I had asked for margarine it would have been provided but one would expect it to be on offer in a hotel of this rating. You can not question the convenience of the location which is a short walk to circular key. However we felt the hotel traded on this and made no effort in other ways. It is tired and needs a facelift. We were later told that the lease is near its end so perhaps this explains why money has not been spent on a much needed refurbishment but at the end of the day the hotel is still charging premium rates for what is definitely not a premium experience. I prefer not to submit negative feedback on trip advisor without first speaking to management. I did ask for a manager to call me so that I could do this but unfortunately I did not receive a call.", "offset": [1358, 1609], "date": "2016-04-02", "cpt": "0", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 3, "uid": "7c97c041-069f-4de7-bae7-0efbd34149eb", "sentence": "Will try something else next time. One would naturally expect top quality from a Four Seasons. I am not saying it is bad but the hotel is a little run down and could do with a facelift. Went with the family and the basic double room was very small so after we saw the room we decided to pay a bit more to get a larger room which was much bigger it was undoubtedly the right moveService was always good and the valet parking for guests was extremely convenient. The staff was always friendly and helpful. Slightly disappointing though that we arrived hotel at 2 pm and still had to wait an hour for our room to be ready. I appreciate that the hotel must have been very full around the Xmas period but at 2 pm I really did not expect to have to wait so long for a room to be ready. Location was excellent if you want to go to The Rocks area and it also was not too far to walk to the shopping areas. The roadworks around George Street meant driving to the hotel was less convenient than usual but no major issues there. All in all we were not unhappy. It was an adequate stay but nothing special. So next time I am in Sydney I will probably try out the Shangri La also near The Rocks or the Westin bang in heart of shopping district.", "offset": [95, 185], "date": "2017-01-07", "cpt": "0", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 4, "uid": "547dbf45-8e86-493b-a670-8557239c9eec", "sentence": "Family celebratory night in city.

Weary traveller beware. The hotel considering that it \u2019s quite dated seems to be undergoing extensive renovations.

I almost hit the roof from the deafening screeching. The workers then went to several other rooms on my floor drilling hammering and laughing away. I complained to the hotel management who promised that they would investigate. They contacted me after my stay to share the conclusions of their investigations which were that \u2018 no maintenance works occurred on my floor \u2019 and that I was probably confusing the drilling just a few meters from my head with traffic from the street below. Just to rub salt in further they then offered to put me on a higher floor for my next stay so that I would n\u2019t be bothered by street noise.

We stayed here in a club room from 11th March. Should have been the day before but we could not get off our Fiji Island as the weather was so bad. We had a corner room with double aspect windows and had been upgraded to a recently refurbished room. Our view from the room was of the Opera House and Harbour bridge. We could see the ferries in and out of the quay and the huge cruise liners docked at the Cruise terminal. My husband particularly liked the switches for raising and lowering the blinds and for turning all lights off together. The room had a Bose speaker that you could play music on from your mobile or tablet. We had paid for a club room which entitled us to use the 32 Club room where we were always warmly greeted whenever we went for breakfast canapes and drinks.
