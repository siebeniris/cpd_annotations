Some Hits Some Misses. I have wanted to stay at the Cincinatian Hotel for years. My parents have stayed there to celebrate special occasions and have always enjoyed their time there. I have frequently recommended the hotel to business associates but I had never stayed there. I finally had the opportunity to stay one night when a snow storm was predicted for the city. The check in experience was very pleasant efficient. Ashley at the front desk was friendly and helpful. This hotel still uses metal room keys as opposed to a plastic key cardOur room was a huge HIT. After reading other reviews on this website it appears that there is a wide variety of room types sizes and perhaps even conditions renovated or not. Our room was very large \u2013 large enough for a king bed a full length couch two additional cushioned chairs a desk and dining table with chairs with room to spare. The bathroom was also large. There was a toilet sink and large tub shower in one room and another sink in a separate room. Having the separate sink in the second room was a nice convenience for a couple trying to get ready for work in the morning at the same time. The room was an interior room with two large windows overlooking the atrium lobby restaurant. And then the best part \u2013 French doors by the bed that opened onto a LARGE private balcony overlooking the hotel \u2019s atrium area. Our room 30 was on the third floor so close enough to watch activities in the lobby area but not so close as to be noisy. Some reviews have commented that the interior facing rooms can be noisy but that was not our experience. However if there were a large event in the restaurant bar area I can see the potential for more noise. For me the atrium set up is a very unique and wonderful aspect of this hotel. Now for the MISSES. There is no getting around it \u2013 this hotel property is worn. In some aspects this lends some charm for example one side of the marble stairway is more worn than the other side due to years of guests walking up and down in the same general area but in many other areas it does not and it is well past time for some reinvestment to keep this property at its former premier level and worthy of a luxury price. While our room was large the bathroom fixtures were worn and in need of updating. The fitness room is an embarrassment. There is a limited set of equipment including two treadmills. It took me several minutes to finally get one to work. One had a functioning TV but the treadmill did n\u2019t work. The other treadmill functioned at a less than ideal level but the TV did n\u2019t work. For a business traveler looking to stay fit on the road the fitness center would be a huge disappointment. The hotel \u2019s website is also a \u201c miss \u201d. It provides very little useful information. In today \u2019s digital age that \u2019s a drawback for this property. Bottom line I was glad to finally stay at this hotel. It has some historic charm but it \u2019s time for some investment to bring it up to its former luxury standard. Downtown Cincinnati has several other new upscale hotel options now \u2013 including a Renaissance Residence Inn 21C. Until more reinvestment is made it would be difficult for me to recommend this hotel to out of town visitors looking for an upscale hotel experience.", "offset": [111, 212], "date": "2015-03-05", "cpt": "0", "category": "family"}, {"id": 3, "uid": "9a1b0656-f6e7-490f-84f9-06ca6b41b12f", "sentence": "A Very Pleasant Hotel.

First of all no mention of EXTENSIVE renovations anywhere on their website when we booked in January for a conference. it is now April the website STILL acts like there are no renovations happening and they will not be done with renovations until beginning of June at the earliest according to an employee. So we felt pretty misled by the website which promises many things including a shuttle restaurant room service and gym that the current hotel does not deliver. I am sure the lobby construction will look nice when it is finished. How do I know. Because the only window in my room looked directly out into the construction zone INSIDE THE HOTEL. This is not an outdoor renovation it is right outside your door and window. I had to keep my blinds shut 24 7 because there were seven floors of scaffolding literally right outside my interior window which means that every wrench piece of lumber and drill that was dropped echoed loudly through all seven open stories of the atrium. Oh not to mention there could be a worker outside the window at any time. I slept about 7 hours total in my three night stay. Additionally I was on a floor of the hotel where literally every room around mine was seemingly being renovated. So we are in an old room surrounded by rooms full of construction workers ripping up hardwood floors drilling new light fixtures in and installing new fittings. There was never a quiet moment at any point of the day or night. No cofemaker in the room. The TV cabinet was partially disassembled with wires poking through. No hairdryer. Come on. Our first night there was a loud party in the room next door. AKA one of the empty construction rooms. To their credit they did shut it down when we called to complain. but we should not have had to do that at a so called four star hotel. That they are currently charging 2913 per night 1950 base room rate plus three taxes is RIDICULOUS. I have stayed at airport hotels with better services and rooms. Again I am sure post renovation it will be great. But right now it is terrible. But what is really beyond the pale is the clear lengths they have gone to hide the current state of the hotel. They did not notify us of renovations until three days before our national conference in other words when it was too late for us to escape. If we had cancelled at that point we still would have been charged for the first nights stay per their cancellation policy. But we could not cancel because every conference hotel in the city was already booked as they knew it would be. They gamed us. The one good thing I can say is that every single person who worked there was unfailingly polite and apologetic. None of this is their fault they are doing what they can.

This is great looking hotel with a lot of history built in the 1880s and has been revamped to bring it up to date with current amenities. Lots of promise here but the details behind it. You have a staff that does not pay attention to cleaning the little things cigarette butts left in the hallway for days we were that for 5 days and they were there the entire time. Wrappers left in the main marbled staircase for days. The room we had had a plush bathroom with heated floor and huge shower bad part is that many tiles in the heated floor did not work and several of the heads in shower leaked. We also had pillow cases on the pillows on our bed that were worn through with holes. I think that hotel manager needs to pay more attention to detail as all of the items that I have named can be fixed with follow up supervision of staff performing the day to day operations of keeping this hotel and it is maintenance up. As far as maintenance I got up early one morning to workout and coming out of my room I saw water pouring from the ceiling in the hallway outside room 307. Based on location I would say that the ice maker on the 4th floor was over flowing and leaking through the ceiling. I informed the front desk and it took several hours to get much of anything done not to mention the carpet then smelled bad from that day forward. The internet service as this hotel was awful. Less than 1 Mbps download and upload speeds. Again this is not a hard fix. I ran tests at multiple locations in the hotel and I found then to be consistent everywhere slow. do not try and run VPN since you will not stay connected as I was trying to do for work. Had a drink in the bar on Saturday August 10th and ordered a drink with a luxardo cherry too bad no luxardo only a maraschino. It you know the difference you would know it is a big deal. I was told by the bar manager they did not have any. With no one in the bar area my group ordered a burger and some appetizers 25 minutes later and no food we asked to cancel the order 10 minutes later the food arrives. There was no one except us in the bar. How is this aceptableLeft our vehicle with the valet at the hotel and they tell you to call down 5 minutes prior to needing your vehicle. We tried four to five times each day to call down to valet and no one every answered. should not this just be a text message. That is how every other place we goes handles it. Anyway we had to go to the valet station after coming downstairs as calls were never answered. As I have said before everything here is fixable but there needs to be supervision and follow up.", "offset": [1924, 2090], "date": "2019-09-01", "cpt": "2", "category": "family"}, {"id": 21, "uid": "783f6dd0-943e-4cd1-b20e-84f3853cdd6a", "sentence": "Originally posted 033019.

HotWire bookers beware We booked a Hot Rate hotel through HotWire and after putting in the desired dates location number of people 4 and then making the purchase commitment the system came up with The Cincinatian. I was pleased the hotel looked nice got a great deal so I drove 35 hours to Cincinnati. Heres what they do not tell you. 1. There is no on site parking. There is however a public parking garage adjacent to the building which costs 21 per day. No big deal but just something to factor in. 2. When my family of four arrived at the front desk the staff member informed us that because we booked through HotWire our bed type could not be guaranteed. They had provided a king but for an upcharge of 8010 they could upgrade us to 2 queens While it is technically true that bed type can not be guaranteed by HotWire their terms and conditions state that the room WILL ACCOMMODATE the number of guests you indicated at the time of booking. Here is the direct quote from their FAQ section. All rooms booked through Hotwire will accommodate the appropriate number of guests in each room based on the total number of guests you provided and the number of rooms you requested when you booked. TLDR do not fall for the queen beds upcharge bait and switch scam. Altogether I spent 20 minutes on the phone with Hotwire before the staff member finally got her manager to unblock the room. After I was told that the manager was not available. Hotwire was amazing. They called the hotel and advocated on my behalf. Very courteous and professional Ultimately after some push back we were not upcharged and the staff member upgraded us to a premier queen. 3. Finally to add a bit of insult to injury when we got to our room only 1 bed had a comforter. The other bed had 2 sheets and a thin rough blanket. No big deal just something to factor in. On the other hand the hotel room was very spacious modern and upscale. The location in downtown Cincinnati is gorgeous and the building itself is beautiful. The staff member was not rude in any way. I just feel bad that she has a cowardly manager who makes manipulation and misinformation part of her job description. All that to say though the situation was ultimately settled to my satisfaction hence 3 generous stars we will not be returning to the Cincinatian again.", "offset": [622, 776], "date": "2019-11-20", "cpt": "2", "category": "family"}, {"id": 22, "uid": "fb67360d-2036-496b-a080-d551f67702fc", "sentence": "Cincinatian Hotel business trip.
