El San Juan Resort Casino does not get enough credit online as i believe it should. Yes there are pros and plenty of cons which goes with any resort and or hotel. I came down to San Juan in March of 2015 for a get away from the miserable New England winter and stay here at El San Juan. I am going to break it down into several categories. Lobby. Fantastic. There are two bars a cigar bar a strange and a club all right in the lobby of the hotel. On the weekends this lobby turns into a big party. A lot of people from other hotels and locals all come here to party so it is a good time. Very clean and extremely upscale. Bring money do not be cheap. A lot of beautiful ladies but along with that comes with a lot of forever 21 basics. Pool Beach. Three different pools to choose from. One with a swim up bar and always very clean. The pool area is full of palm trees and well manicured. There are also two more big bars and full food service right there also. The beach is great as towel and chair service is complimentary for all hotel guest. A lot of local vendors selling food on the beach. Give it a try some are very good. Room If you can get a deck or a balcony its beautiful. The rooms are well lit with tile flooring. May be strange for some who come from the city but it is worth it considering the warm weather. TV is tiny and no mini bar or microwave so expect to eat out a lot and bring nothing back. Pillows and bed are extremely comfortable. I honestly pass out each time easily regardless of how much to drink. Bathrooms NEED MAJOR renovations. Tiles are dirty and you can see a bit of mold. Overall good amount of space and comfortable. Restaurants. A lot of different restaurants right inside the hotel from sushi to a steak seafood house. They are good but of course over priced. Leave the resort as the street is full of local restaurants that are extremely good. Shopping. The galleria has a small convince store liquor store little clothing and bikini shop Starbucks sunglasses hut which became my best friend as i probably spend almost a grand there in a few short days. Overall the hotel is very good and certainly a fun place to stay. The casino staff are friendly but small. If you hate the casino but like gambling there is a cockfighting arena across the street.

In general the hotel is well located on Isla Verde and has great bones. It is a little shopworn I heard that it is over 40 years old. I found the conference food to be above average and the breakfast brunch at La Teraza was very good although expensive. The casino is small but well managed.

Cons check in took quite some time and I had to call for a few room issues including a non working TV. MILDEW humidity everywhere but the lobby and meat market. The lobby becomes a scene at night where every table becomes reserved for bottle service. May be a plus for younger travelers but I enjoy a lobby bar to relax and socialize not one in which I need to spend a few hundred to secure a chair The room looked nice at first but when I took a closer look had evidence of mold and worn furnishings. Room had a terrible mildew odor and was always damp furniture had stains and the sheets felt like they were damp. Hotels solution was to raise Ac and spray Lysol. The business meeting room was underground with no windows loud Ac poor AV and also damp and smelled of mildew. The shower was awkward and uncomfortable. The bathroom was very small. Clothing storage was good but once again the closets smelled awful. My entire suitcase now smells coming home. I took photos of the mold dirt on the bed frame and furniture Overal to rate a resort like this it is about pros and cons.

I went to El San Juan resort for the first time in late January for a short vacation only four days and it was a real story of ups and downs. We checked in at noon and they had a room available for us even though check. in is not until 4 PM. But the room had a horrible view dirty gray rooftops of whatever was below us and a series of problems the bathroom door was a sliding door almost like a barn door. that did not slide smoothly on its track so it took a lot of effort to open and close it the TV would lose its signal every 10 minutes or so for about 30 or 60 seconds our toilet was leaking at the base forming a little puddle on the floor and the black out curtains had small tears in it letting in light. This had to be the shabbiest room in the entire resort. The next morning we went to the front desk to complain but said we did not want to change rooms since we had already unpacked and were only there for 2 more nights and did not want the hassle of packing moving and unpacking again. The front desk attendant said she would have someone come in and fix all the issues. We were out of the room all day and when we returned at 7 PM we found that whoever came in to fix it left the bathroom a grimy filthy mess. There was dirt and grime inside the toilet on the toilet and on the floor. The worst part they had neglected to reconect the toilet so it was not even functioning. Now we had to move. Heres the good part of the story they moved us to an upgraded room that was not in the main building. Instead it was right outside the pool. It had a private patio and a fully tiled shower with a skylight and two shower heads. More about the hotel there are two beautiful pools but be prepared to go out early to claim your chairs. When we were there the last week in January it was very crowded with a lot of families and one of the pools was very noisy with many kids screaming and throwing balls etc. The other pool was much quieter. there is a swim up bar but that is at the noisy pool. There are only two elevators in the main tower so sometimes we had to wait a while for it. There are a lot of restaurants on the property but they are fairly pricey. Also my boyfriend was astonished at the prices for drinks. Beer and wine was 8 plus tax but mixed drinks are 13 plus tax bringing them to right under 15. If we go again we will definitely try restaurants in the area rather than stay at the resort. The staff is very nice. I watched while a pool worker escorted an elderly lady to her chair while holding her hand. He helped her sit down and then took off her shoes for her. But I did think some of the wait service was slow one night we waited so long to get the check my boyfriend got up and hunted down the waiter to ask him to bring itThe hotel is only a 5 minute cab ride from the airport 15 but you do not hear a lot of airplane noise during the day. it is about 15 or 20 minutes 22 cab ride to Old San Juan. Finally we asked for a late check out 2 PM instead of noon and they were able to accommodate us. Ultimately we enjoyed our stay there but were really disappointed by the problems we had at the beginning. it is not what I had expect of a resort of this caliber.", "offset": [1327, 1415], "date": "2016-02-01", "cpt": "0", "category": "venue"}, {"id": 7, "uid": "e0aba7b2-bcbd-41cc-b70d-63d8dbdabe4c", "sentence": "Know what you are getting before selecting this property.

The pool and beach were clean convenient with pool bar.

I must all of the staff was extremely nice. really showed a good culture of Puerto Ricans. Restaurant and pool food was delicious but expensive.

We were just at the hotel. I had read the reviews prior to leaving home and came. this close to changing hotels but figured I would take my chance here. It was cheaper getting to the hotel by taxi than anticipated. 10 base 2 airport fee 1 state fee 1 bag. It \u2019s still overpriced when in most other cities the 3 miles would have been covered by a hotel shuttle the policies here stink but not the hotels \u2019 fault directly. I will complement the lobby and grounds for being beautiful. However upon arrival we were immediately met by the protestors \u2019 chants in front of the hotel. They have an entire section of the sidewalk apron blocked off for them to house their tents vehicles etc \u2026 basicaly a base camp so they \u2019re not going away anytime soon. Until hearing their bullhorn and loudspeakers it \u2019s extremely hard to envision the sheer amount of noise they create until experiencing it in person. I will say that some of their chants were actually melodic and not too disturbing however not when heard early in the morning or late at night. The mind blowing thing though is that upon check in I mentioned reading about the protestors on TA the hotel staff 3 different staff members 2 guys in pinstripe jackets 1 girl insisted that the front protestors had simmered down and guaranteed that there were no as in ZERO. protestors on the beach anymore. They even recommended that I submit this review as a revision of the prior ones letting people know this. THIS WAS A LIE. Indeed protestors continue on the beach as I type this. Mind you it \u2019s not 12 hours a day and not at the crack of dawn or late evening. However 100 they still exist and have their tent set up just outside the eastern entrance to the pool area. Luckily we barely heard their noise as I was in a high enough room. Additionally the hotel tried to drown them out by cranking up the music playing around the pool area but that was only successful if staying by the pool closest to the hotel entrance. Bottom line \u2026 protestors continue both in front and in back of the hotel. Construction continues. They \u2019re still working on the new fitness spa area and I \u2019m not sure if that \u2019s the noise we heard but we were awoken the first morning at 9 am by the sounds of drilling or maybe a jackhammer. So much for sleeping in on vacation. The other days it has n\u2019t been as bad though. There is a convention here this week. The attendees are n\u2019t too bad \u2026. a bunch of old men having fun getting drunk by the pool. Some have brought their families but most are flying solo and living it up. They were mostly well behaved and I was n\u2019t too concerned with them being around children. However the pool and bar staff are clearly catering to them as we were left sitting by the pool for at least 10 15 minutes before getting any drink that was ordered. They also dominated the pool area and indoor spaces for several of their events. It was n\u2019t too bad but just something to note. Upon check in we were advised of a Sunday pool party. We were at the pool from 10 1 then 2 4 yesterday and there was n\u2019t a hint of a pool party anywhere to be seen. We were actually looking forward to it but \u2026. While we \u2019re on the pool topic \u2026 chair hogs are in full force. You know \u2026 those people that get up put their towels on the chairs and then disappear for hours. Between the convention folks and the moronic chair hogs it was tough to find a spot. Staff tried to be helpful in pulling extra chairs from cabanas but there \u2019s only so much real estate to cover. The beach area was easier to get a seat as staff would bring out a chair from the stack if one on the beach was n\u2019t available. The only issue with the beach besides the protestors is that the beautiful sand is fine and with the wind it tended to fly in our face quite frequently. The beach area is clean beautiful though. It has many activities in the immediate area for hire jet ski parasail etc \u2026. All in all it has been a decent experience. The hotel is in a nice location for outside food choices Chilis most fast food options and several local fare options as well if not wanting to pay exorbitant hotel prices and a good base camp for excursions to other parts of the island. The only other interesting tidbit \u2026 there are 3 guys here presumably guests but they seem to know much of the staff as they are greeting them with handclasps and bro hugs. Each has a different hair color red blue and brown and one is wearing a court ordered ankle monitoring device.
