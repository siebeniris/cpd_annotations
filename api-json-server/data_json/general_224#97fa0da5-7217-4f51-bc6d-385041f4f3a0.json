Due to my Diamond status we were upgraded to an oceanfront suite with its own hot spa where I would watch the sun rise every morning. The staff were amazing as others have mentioned. I kept wondering is it Conrad training or Balinese culture. Most likely a combination of both. The service is impeccable and comes with the warmest of smiles.

We arrived back in the UK two weeks ago from having ended our months holiday in AustralAsia with a seven night stay at the Conrad Bali. A wonderful hotel experience for a relaxing stay in Bali. We had breakfast included which was buffet style that had everything you could ever want for a good breakfast whatever your Nationality. We had a garden view room on the third floor on the most northerly wing of the hotel it was large by most hotel standards and very well appointed with a large balcony sufficient for two loungers we asked for a second which was brought to us within 15 mins of asking and table and two chairs. The swimming pools are fabulous with a large central pool plus a pool that stretches around the hotel complex from one side to the other with a small sand beach area at each end it was always immaculately clean. No shortage of loungers whatever time of day we wanted to relax. The restaurants are a bit expensive by UK standards. but if you stay in a 5 hotel with an adjacent beach location its what you probably should expect. They do a meal value package at the Eight Degrees South Restaurant that is right on the beach. for \u00a3 50 person you get a 3 course meal and unlimited drinks. If you do not want to run to the expense of hotel meals there are two good restaurants nearby we can recommend. The Paon Doeloe inside the Taman Bhagwan. its just a 10 minute stroll Northwards along the beach. try it first for lunch best Spring Rolls ever. \u00a3 150 with a beer \u00a3 2. ask them to pick you up at the Hotel and take you back for evening dinner. no charge best not to walk at night. Other restaurant is Bumbu Bali which is 20 minute walk going northwards. great food even if a little expensive by Bali standards \u00a3 30 for two persons inc drinks. the Hotel will book you a table and again Bumbu offers free pick up and return from to Hotel 5 mins in car. There is also a free bus shuttle from the hotel every hour from 90am to 930pm to the Bali Collection at Nusa Dua 10 minutes drive away which is a large modern shopping outlet branded numerous restaurants catering for every Nationality at very affordable prices if you go in the day there is a lovely walk through some parkland and a long sandy beach really nice there. On a point of service excellence we had a minor issue with our room two days before we departed. it was resolved within 60 minutes by Manager Made Sumantara who was very attentive. We met Stephane Roubin who is Director of Operations of the Conrad as we were leaving a very nice gentleman and he should be commended on running a wonderful hotel with some of the most courteous and helpful staff we have ever experienced during our travels around the World.

Long before there was social media world travelers depended not on what friends and family told them which hotels to stay in and why. I have now been travelling for over 35 years and had written many reviews on Tripadvisor and post them as accurately as I can. I also try to make my reviews constructive and make suggestions for improving the customers experience. Many hotel brands now face the challenge of tactfully and gracefully dealing with hotel reviews that often come from travelers who are far from objective and sometimes make no sense. It is very important for hotels to realize that properties that practice successful brand management are almost four times as likely to receive a booking as a hotel that does not. Check in Experience Including recognition of the status of the hotel guest\u2022. We were checked in the main lobby or check in area as DiamondTop Tier members of the Hilton program\u2022. Usually Top Tier members are checked in in the Lounge so as to make the top tier member feel exclusive and important comparing to the IC Bali as well as the London Gatwick Hilton\u2022. Even though we had arranged for a hotel pick up it seemed as if the hotel staff was not prepared as I was not addressed by name until a few clicks of the computer\u2022. At the IC Bali the staff was waiting for our arrival as we had pre arranged our pick up and they were well aware of our arrival. That just makes the check in experience memorable and special. Staffs Engagement Level\u2022. Overall the staff in the Lounge did seem very interested in what they were doing. All of them were great and I have to mention names Simponi Ratna Dasa Swartini Adnyana JuniRom Asignment\u2022 Thanks to the Hilton Honours program and hotel management that we were upgraded to the suites section of the hotel. This is an exclusive wing with a separate pool with cabanas\u2022. The room was beautiful with a separate living dining and bedroom. The bathroom was perfect with a rain shower as well as a tub and a separate toilet\u2022 Toiletries provided were of a high caliber paraben fre\u2022. There was no welcome gift and no fruit. I had to call the reception and inquire about it and was told it was not normal practice to have welcome fruit or a welcome gift. They did eventually send some fruit and 2 stuffed toys. Breakfast Lounge\u2022 Breakfast was served in the RIN restaurant for Suites guests\u2022 Breakfast was made to order from an a la cart menu. \u2022. On day one we were not presented with a menu and the staff member who took our order messed up on our order of egg whites. This is a minor mistake and could have been due to language issues. But over the next few days our order was taken and delivered acordingly\u2022. We also noted that there was never any cold bottled water when we asked on 2 occasions. We were given warm water botles\u2022. The evening lounge and canapes were good except that on the last night we were served almost frozen Chinese steamed buns. I brought this to the attention of the staff and they noted the issue and presented us with teriyaki alternative canapes\u2022. The lounge staff should enforce strict attire as mentioned somewhere in the lounge paraphernalia that guests must be dressed in business casual attire. But we noticed guests that had their shoes off with their feet on the sofa as well as someone who was in flip flops and a tank top singlet\u2022. I feel that this just lowers the standard of the lounge and the experience for others. Hotel Grounds\u2022. The pool for the suites section was amazing with a relaxing feeling except for continuous construction noise from the adjacent construction of villas for the hotel\u2022. Guests were provided with bottles of water and towels\u2022. The gym was adequate as I used it daily in the mornings it had free weights and some machines as well as treadmils\u2022. We also noted an absence of a mini bar for the Suites pool guests as in the IC Bali. It makes it easy for guests to walk over to the bar and order a drink. The IC Balis pool bar also had banana fritters and little surprises like that for pool guests. Check Out Experience\u2022. We arranged for an Uber pick up and I think it was Juni who assisted us with the check out process in the lounge.

The linen the towels the washrooms everything was shining. We have two babies and the resort welcomed them with a cute little toiletry hamper from Johnson and Johnson. It was a very sweet gesture. The restaurants have super yummy food. We tried all the restaurants and kept licking our fingers all the time yes we are big time foodies. The restaurants can be full a lot of times esp the beachfront restaurant. so it is a good idea to book a table beforehand. The deserts as the beachfront restaurant are so good that I could keep eating there all my life. The breakfast spread was awesome one of the best I have seen. The ambience is also excellent. My elder daughter was completely engaged with the Koi fishes of their breakfast area pond while we sat back and enjoyed every morsel. They have massive pools on all sides of the resort which have bridges going over them. So it is visually very appealing. They also have huge trees around the pools so swimming in the Bali sun is not that bad even during the time the trees provide a lot of shaded area to laze around in the pool. There are a lot of water sports that one can indulge in. Sadly we could not go for it as we have small babies. The hotel also has shuttles for some nearby popular places. it is free of cost.

As we spend almost every day down by the beach we would like to say a big thank you to the staff at Azure. They take such good care of us making sure that we have everything we need. I never fail to be in admiration for them. They take care of guests over such a large area and yet somehow much to keep smiling when guests are being demanding and difficult even when they themselves are feeling hot and tired. Of course all the staff at the Conrad are superb and look after us so well and I do hope that they know how well they succeed. It is because of the staff that we return. Yes the hotel is beautiful and it is great to be close to the sea but we could find that a lot closer to home but not the warmth and care of such great people.

Yes it is expensive compared with local restaurants but it is of very high quality and the menu is frequently changed to reflect the tastes of the guests. It may be cheaper to eat elsewhere but the Conrad has such a beautiful setting and of course often has evening entertainment. Not only that but the chefs will willingly take care of any special requests and dislikes such as my hatred of corianderI have also read complaints about weddings but they do not go on past 10 pm and there are controls over how much noise is allowed.

He fully explained all facility information and room orientation was made by him. Even his English skill was not so good but I really felt his genuine hospitality. Cleanliness in the room was fantastic. Even one hair can not see during my stay. I realised compare to another hilton worldwide property size of bed was different. It was quite bigger than any other properties which made me happy. Regarding room condition I will be pending for next visit due to fully aware on going and started renovation work. At night I went to reception to borrow some stationary due to no business centre in this property. Efie was the one who assisted me with speedy and prompt action. She is also the one who really can engage with guest and she can make emotional connection. Breakfast venue was very clouded. I was a bit disappointed due to coffee was not served even staff came to approach me. Finally I waited almost 30 mins to get coffee. I ca n\u2019t recall his name but one of senior staff who is muddle age it could be in charge. he immediately suggested I can bring back coffee to my room. His service recovery was excellent. Overall better have more manning for breakfast venue. During stay I was in and out fromHotel. Always greeted me by mentioning my name was Niken. She is also the one who can go for extra mile for guest by engagement. Overall experience staffs are really friendly and hospitable. I could n\u2019t mention the name here all but it is sure all staffs who is well trained made my stay special. Once again thank you so much for providing me genuine hospitality. I am looking forward coming back to stay after the renovation all completed. Or I might be back soon cause I really liked the quality of service in conrad Bali.

A group of 12 of us went to Bali and we stayed at the Conrad. We have all previously stayed before and based on our exceptional experience last time when my brother had his wedding there we decided to return. It \u2019s situated overlooking a beautiful beach. When you enter the hotel it \u2019s ever so beautiful. From the reception area you can see the swimming pool and blue sea. True paradise. After check in we went to our rooms which were absolutely gorgeous. Such tasteful decor and views to die for. We dined at the restaurants on a few occasions and we were very impressed with the food and service. Breakfast was so delicious with so much choice you can not manage it all. Everyday I had something different just so I could try it all. After two weeks I was still trying new things everyday. A member of staff that stood out so much and always went out of his way to look after us at breakfast was Mangku. But all the other staff were also amazing. Our previous stay and this one Agung really looked after us. Such an exceptional member of staff that goes the extra mile. He is the reason for us returning and will be returning again next year as well. Thank you so much for all of your help time and effort to make our stay Memorable and outstanding. We really appreciate it. We met the General Manager Markus Kocsh who kindly came to introduce himself to us. Such a lovely man. I can understand why the staff are so happy when they have a manager like him. We celebrated two birthdays when we were there and the staff arranged birthday cakes in the room. We were so flattered and grateful. Thank you again. The hotel is great for kids as well as adults. All the staff were so friendly helpful and nice. A special thank you to Fridayanti Sujatini Rudiyani and Eka for looking after us so well in the bar by reception.

They were able to entertain all my requests professionally. Reception staff need to improve. Our keycard was not working and we requested for replacement cards. Instead the reception staff was enquiring about our incidental charges instead of replacing our cards. We already had deposit with the hotel and one more night before checking out.

I spent five nights at the Conrad Bali at the beginning of November and I must say as a solo traveler still getting used to that situation I was made to feel like family. From the moment I was picked up by their pre arranged transport until the moment I checked out staff could not have been more accommodating. The resort itself was most relaxing and quite tranquil despite some ongoing renovations. Walking to breakfast every morning was always a treat as staff would greet me in such a warm and genuine manner. The Balinese I encountered on this trip were such a kind and gentle people helping me in any way they could even if it were not in their own self interest. Sekar the hotel concierge went out of her way to engage me in lively conversation whenever our paths crossed. She helped me resolve a billing issue with such grace and aplomb making me feel far more important than warranted. Within the second day of my stay I was already being addressed by name and my specific preferences at the Suku restaurant Executive Lounge and Suites Pool committed to memory by staff. I was mightily impressed especially given the size of the resort. As a Hilton Honors Diamond member I was upgraded to a beautiful suite really too large for me on my own but appreciated nonetheless. It overlooked the Suites Pool and the large balcony was most inviting with a table chairs and large settee. A breeze often created a comfortable temperature in which to watch the setting sun. Quite romantic for guests traveling as a couple which almost all were. Everything in the suite was in perfect working order and a wet bar two mini refrigerators a capsule coffee maker dinnerware glassware and various other kitchen oriented apparatus were also provided in the dining area. The bed was superbly comfortable and although described as two twins actually was comprised of two king or queen sized beds joined to form an enormous unit easily large enough for four. The rainfall shower provided a steady supply of hot water and the quiet HVAC system was efficient in keeping the room at a perfectly comfortable setting. Buffet breakfast at Suku was always a treat that I eagerly anticipated after rising in the morning. Staff were so friendly plying me with the French press coffee that I so urgently needed to keep up my energy level. The selection was extensive and changed daily. As in most hotels in Asia Western Asian and Japanese fare was offered. Lamb beef chicken fish and vegetarian dishes were in the daily rotation as was sushi cheese and cold cuts. One could order \u00e0 la carte or from the egg station and I thoroughly enjoyed the Eggs Benedict made with chicken rather than pork back bacon. Bread and pastries were also of a high standard perhaps not as good as some venues in Europe but certainly better than most in the Americas. In the evenings the Executive Lounge provided canap\u00e9s and snacks as well as an assortment of beverages including wine beer spirits and mixed cocktails. It was always such a pleasant way to end the day. Staff there were always solicitous and polite to a fault. Staff at all the pools were quick to bring cold water and wet towels to refresh both ones thirst and extremities. There were always loungers available and the chaise cushions and towels were thick and very comfortable. Umbrellas were set up for all loungers providing ample shade from the hot sun. The grounds were immaculately maintained and the shrubs trees flowers and extensive landscaping were most attractive in providing a beautiful tropical setting. I must say given my experiences during this visit I will be putting Bali and the Conrad back in the forefront of my future travels. If you have n\u2019t yet visited I encourage you to do so and consider staying at the Conrad if at all possible.", "offset": [538, 693], "date": "2018-11-12", "cpt": "2", "category": "general"}, {"id": 24, "uid": "08dffa16-1301-4635-830d-ebffa126609f", "sentence": "Outstanding so beautiful so worth it. \u2665 \ufe0f Excellent service from arriving and booking our stay last minute at reception for the entirety of our 5 day stay.

We happened to be staying while they were renovating some of the rooms meaning the hotel was a lot quieter than usual which was perfect for our romantic break. One of our waiters even invited us to their staff do as they were having a party by the pool one evening with an extensive buffet and all the free drink you could manage.

Where do I start. in summary I can say Conrad Bali has been the worst and most disapointing experience in all my years of travel and to top it off as a diamond hilton member. No proper information given during checkin housekeeping bad suki restaurant staff for dinner is below average reception staff do nt have all the information required. need I go on. The reception staff did not even give us a tour of the property or benefits that I am entitled to as member so for 4 nights I was discovering benefits I am eligible to like the club access lounge with breakfast and separate evening hours. I am eligible for an upgrade to a suite and the reception person told me the lagoon view is better as it is renovated versus the suites are not and I am better off. So I believed the person and chose to not upgrade without even viewing which is a big mistake. Tonight I saw the area and benefits close to it and it just made me feel cheated and left at a big disadvantage. I am still at the property and leaving tomorrow tonight I tried the Rin restaurant which is very good in terms of service and food options quality. I did nt even know they had a set menu offer with. They needs to get a A and they were surprised to know I have been staying for 4 nights and not visited or dined with them. And it goes back to the level of service and there is no proper information told to you or in the room which is such a disappointment especially when you are on a holiday or even a first time visitor to Bali. Housekeeping kept making mistakes like leaving the ashtray inside the room left used glass and spoon back amongst other minor issues. On my 2nd day I went to complain to the duty manager and they sent me a person who I assumed was in guest relations or a manager. The person listened to me took my feedback and that evening left me a note to change my room if I was interested but with no followup or call is that the way you treat an upset customer. To make things worse I was made aware that she was in finance and not even the right person to raise my concern. how careless can they be. In all I should have stayed in Ubud as I was advised but as it was a Hilton property and having had a good stay in all of my Hilton stays worldwide I took a chance even with bad reviews I read. good lesson learnt and never returning to this hotel again.
