We really enjoyed our visit to Palm Springs. Another thing that made it more memorable was our stay at the Ivy Palm Resort. It is so near the Palm Springs Aerial Tramway very close 15 miles to Downtown Palm Springs and about 15 20 mins drive to Desert Premium Outlet in Cabazon. The front desk and housekeeping staff were so nice to us. They got this awesome gamerom with different colors painted on the wall that my kids and I found so amazing and worth every selfie not to mention the ring light in the corner of the room where it serves as a photo booth area.

The keys to my room did n\u2019t work and my girlfriend had to wait while I walked back TWICE to the office to get a set of new keys while only one key worked and the other one was useless. The pool was shutdown by City if Riverside due to unsanitary conditions. The room my girlfriend and I were placed in were in a rundown building which seemed was not part of the hotel but a separate building with a swarm of bees adjacent to our room and pigeons looking for a cool spot away from the sunlight while flying over our heads every time we came out of the room.
