We spent three nights at the Renaissance in November of 2015. It was an overall pleasant stay but there were still some issues with the experience The room was pretty clean if maybe a little boring as hotel rooms go The location is great if you are interested in spending time in downtown Wilemstad. The pontoon bridge is just five minutes away and there are some wonderful restaurants within a twenty minute walking distance The pool area is just great. The water is warm. The fake beach is convincing enough. The drinks are a little overpriced but we did not feel like we were getting totally ripped of We had a 4th floor room with an ocean view. This gave us a great view of the water and whatever cruise ship happened to be docked on a given day. As some others have said an interior room has views of an event space in the hotel which hosted a wedding and a marketing seminar during our stay so we were extremely pleased to have spent a little more money to get a room with an ocean view The casino is mediocre and impossibly smoky. Part of the casino is separated from the lobby with a glass wall but another part is connected to the lobby. As a result the hotel lobby gets really smoky. This was not a big deal for us since we never ate at the hotel but I could see it being a problem for people who want to eat at the restaurants in the loby The water at the hotel remains an issue. We took maybe one legitimately hot shower several warm showers and one rather cold shower. I have no idea how water heating works in a massive hotel but it is incredible to me that this issue has seemingly lingered for months at this hotel. In summary I imagine that the Renaissance is one of the best hotels in Wilemstad for the money. The pool beach and location are major pluses. And while the dodgy hot water situation did not really have any material impact on our trip it is still a major strike against them that a large Mariot branded hotel can not seem to get its act together on their infrastructure.", "offset": [1257, 1453], "date": "2015-11-15", "cpt": "0", "category": "restaurant"}, {"id": 5, "uid": "bbd82638-c421-4b82-8664-cc9242efbe24", "sentence": "Nice hotel great swimming pool.

We stayed at this hotel for 1 week in December 2015. The hotel is clean and located in the downtown of Wilemstad which provides for a nice place to walk around after dinner. The hotels main attraction for us was the infinity pool which has a restaurant bar serving the pool guests. While the hotel itself was overall good the service left a lot to desire. The staff at this hotel and its restaurants and bars has no desire at all to be helpful. The service they offer is slow and they do not rush even if they see that you seem impatient with the long wait for their service. They also rarely deliver the entire order in case you order for several people like we sometimes did. We saw hotel supervisors constantly hanging around and laughing with the hotel staff so instead of helping them do a better job the supervisors were actually preventing their staff from doing their job. We noticed that throughout the entire week we spent there and throughout all service areas room cleaners pool cleaners restaurants When we arrived we were provided our room numbers but were then asked if for 25 per night we would like to have our room upgraded to a room with a balcony. We declined the offer and were asked to wait in the lobby until the rooms were ready. After some time the receptionist came and said that she managed to upgrade our rooms to rooms with a balcony at no extra charge but the room numbers we were assigned were the same that we had earlier been assigned when we were told that we should pay for the upgrade to rooms with balcony. We concluded that this had been a dishonest attempt to get us to pay 25 per night to get the same rooms with a balcony. we were already assigned. FYI we did not set foot on the balcony during our stay. Food at the hotels restaurants is ok though it barely vary throughout the week. The only restaurant with really good food is the Xquisit steakhouse. For dinner you must make reservations while for lunch it is somewhat easy to find seats without a reservation. The food we were offered during the New Years night at the Infinity restaurant was very disappointing and was of poorer quality and variety then the regular lunch buffet menu. It was rather frustrating and a bit weird to not hear any music at all for the first 5 days in particular since we were there in the Christmas and New Years period. The only time when music was played was during New Years night and Friday night at the Xquisit restaurant. We found this lack of music to be very unusual considering that this hotel is a vacation resort and not a business meetings place. One of the most frustrating aspects was that the all inclusive service we had purchased was not very all inclusive as when ordering food at the bar or at the Xquisit restaurant some drinks or menu items would come at an extra charge without the menu not clearly identifying which items were part of the not so all inclusive service and which ones were not. Champagne and most foreign drinks are examples of the drinks not included in the all inclusive service. So overall this is a nice place with below average service and with zero focus on entertainment of the guests. We will not return to this hotel.", "offset": [2399, 2505], "date": "2016-01-14", "cpt": "0", "category": "restaurant"}, {"id": 7, "uid": "66acabf9-7302-4d04-bc4d-3499f36b32b1", "sentence": "Nice centrally located hotel but too crowded and busy for my taste.

Booked Curacao because I had never been. Booked Renaissance because I was familiar with brand having stayed at the Aruba Renaissance many moons ago. Arrived on night flight from Miami. did not matter there were still ample doormen and bellmen to attend to us immediately and usher us into the lobby a big open affair with reception desk to the left Nautilus restaurant buffet straight ahead and casino and Blue bar to the right. We checked in without incident and were given a nice room with a big comfortable king bed and an updated bathroom with tub shower combo. The bellman walked us through all points of the room including tv safe refrigerator electronics power station robes and slippers etc. A nice comfortable clean room. It was a bit of a stroll from the elevators but this is a big hotel and I do not mind the exercise that may change in 20 years. But it was on the 2nd floor which has get this a Starbucks that opens at 630a and is on the way to the man made beach salt water pool and bar and grill. Yes on the 2nd floor. This Renaissance built an infinity pool two floors up against the rocky and rough surf coast so it looks almost seamless with the sea and added an expansive beach with palapas beach chairs and a bar and grill with lounges and tables open at 1030a. it is quite the private beach oasis. Open dawn til dusk. Spent many days from daybreak to almost sunset on that beach. Wonderful. It is raked every morning from end to end. Kept very well. And there is some very unique entertainment visible from the beach. watching tugs lead ships and tankers in and out of Sint Anna Bay just to the left of the beach. And to the right if you are up and out early enough 7a you can watch the huge cruise ships coming in to port and being guided and secured to the pier. I do not think these kind of sights are available from a beach chair anywhere else. And a shout out to Bianca who had my Bloody Marys ready at all times at the Beach Bar and Grill. A star on any staff. And my wife says she got one of her best massages ever at the spa tent on the beach. I have seen written that this is an old hotel and needs upgrading. I see some small signs of age here and there or out of date decor but nothing old and dirty or requiring immediate change. I think the facility is well kept. The Renaissance besides having the aforementioned casino and restaurants inside the hotel also have an extensive mall walk outside anything from t shirts to Tiffanys is available to peruse and purchase during your stroll. Oh yes and a movie theater. Continue further thru the mall and you come to the Rif Fort also part of the Renaissance complex and a charming and wonderful part of their facility. Walk past old cannon and through a gated tunnel of 4 12 foot thick walls built of coral stone in 1826 and you enter a large open air courtyard surrounded by the thick fort walls. Where soldiers may have mustered or powder and cannon shot may have been stored almost 200 years ago shops and restaurants now stand with their doors open ready to sell you everything from steak and ribs to a burger from a stropwafel to sushi from beer to ice cream to a cura\u00e7ao keepsake to jewelry. And in the middle of all theses surrounding stores are tables and chairs and umbrellas and palm trees. A perfect place to shop and sit and eat and drink the afternoon or evening away. We spent many an early afternoon here for lunch at Douwe Egberts the Norwegian salmon baguette and the DE Breakfast are killer and many a late evening sitting and enjoying some ice cream from Dons Ice Cream shopmango cream sherbet is viking after dinner at Steak and Ribs on the parapet of this fort separate reviewSo as you can tell the Renaissance is all pretty self contained and is not lacking for much. I do wish it had a convenience store for small things like a soda water. maybe snacks for the room like chips that kind of thing. After all the rooms have a fridge. What do I put in itVenture further out past the hotel and fort complex and you can walk along the bay promenade where island residents set up a small bazaar to sell souvenirs. You can also spot a KFC and a Pizza Hut across the street for those interested in that kind of thingyuk. Walk a little further and you come to the famous Queen Ema Pontoon Bridge. Walk over this and you are in Punda a whole different and interesting area of Wilemstad. There are restaurants on that side of the bridge as well. Some hidden some not. You just have to walk around and see what interests you. This is an example of how centrally located I think the Renaissance is. I was very content at the hotel and its surrounding area everything within a healthy walk. The staff was always nice and helpful the room was clean and very comfortable the amenities save for a convenience store were not lacking one bit the location was perfect no need for a car in my opinion unles you wanted to digest the entire island in your visit. I did not. I came to relax and absorb some vitamin D as well as a tasty beverage or two. And a good meal. All of which I found at the Renaissance and in the surrounding area. I know I missed some kickin beaches but I hope there is a next time to get jigy with that. And let us not forget the casino and I only recommend the Renaissance casino. The others were really seedy joints. Tired of relaxing. There is action right downstairs. Who can ask for anything moreAs a footnote I do wish they would eliminate smoking in their casino. If Renaissance Mariot is serious about billing themselves as a smoke free facility they have to stop the casino from allowing smoking.

The polside on the first floor almost felt like a natural beach and was the best feature of the hotel. Also great to have a Starbucks for good coffee in the building.
