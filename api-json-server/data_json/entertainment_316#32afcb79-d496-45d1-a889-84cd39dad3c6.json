Vegas at night was amazing with a view of everything. The room was fantastic large with a separate bedroom that opens to the terrace a living room that is elegantly styled and furnished and a bath that has a shower and soaking tub behind glass walls that is amazingly huge. And this hotel has some amazing restaurants. And the hotel is in City Center and a short walk to many other close by venues like Planet Hollywood Crystals shopping the Aria etc. We thoroughly enjoyed this stay in Vegas at the Cosmopolitan.

My wife and I \u2019s favorite hotel in Las Vegas used to be The Cosmopolitan. We were there when the place opened for New Years Eve in 2010 with a concert featuring Jay Z Cold Play John Mayer and Beyonc\u00e9. The next year we were invited back for the New Year \u2019s celebration with Stevie Wonder. We have had so many fabulous experiences at the property over the years. Since we were such frequent guests over the years we even established friendships with the staff both in the restaurants and in the casino. I have brought clients to the property as well as friends and family. I will never ever do that again. We were seriously loyal to The Cosmopolitan because it was always one of the most personalized and friendly experiences and I think those are the types of experiences that every human being craves. The Cosmo has historically done a legendary job creating personalized friendly authentic and hassle free experiences. In four years of cumulative experiences they have been nothing short of outstanding each and every time. This includes small details such as room service bar staff waitresses and housekeepers being fast fun friendly and authentic. We know many of the employees families and pets. Unfortunately it is a place I will never step foot in again. You may wonder what it takes for someone who is so loyal and has so many positive memories vow to never return to the place. Before I tell you how years of loyalty were destroyed in minutes I must caution you the very same thing can happen to you and your business. This New Year my wife and I were out of the country but returned to Las Vegas January 2. One of the first things we typically do is go see Mary at Jaleo which we did the first night we arrived. I think one of the most fun times you could have is to sit down and ask Mary to take care of you and be inspired by the food she presents and the wine she pairs with it. The following day was equally awesome seeing familiar friends and faces all over the property. I usually tip the staff more than I bet so people remember me. My wife and I go to Vegas mostly to socialize. Sitting at the tables we follow the dealers not caring what type of game they are dealing. Even if it is a silly game where the odds are incredibly against you we still sit there because we enjoy the company of the friendly people. The first two days of this stay we pretty much laughed the entire time. It was quite infectious as those around us also had a memorable experience. This even included the staff. With all the craziness complexities aps and technology I think people more than ever crave nice friendly human beings. For years this is what we experienced at The Cosmopolitan. Unfortunately on Sunday around 41 PM this changed forever. After playing some roulette with our new dealer friend Robert we decided to go up to our room to watch the Dallas Detroit wild card game. It is not 41 AM. I \u2019m talking about 41 in the afternoon. We are in our room having a glass of wine watching the game and yes screaming and yelling our heads off at the television because Detroit was kicking Dallas \u2019 butt and we both wanted Dallas to cover. Why are we never going back to The Cosmopolitan. All of the sudden security pounded on our door and stormed our suite like a seal team. Five large security men slammed the door open causing my wife to do a windmill and almost fall onto the couch with the force of their entry I was already standing because I rarely sit and was immediately told to sit down by two of the security officers. I asked why they were even here and they said they needed to inspect the room for property damage. This was crazy. I said \u201c You can see there is nothing wrong with the suite. Why would take five of you forcibly entering our room \u201d. I was told once again to just sit and not say anything. Security proceeded to turn over our room like they were looking for a lost treasure or a golden bar. They tore through our room like they were looking for a clue to a murder mystery and left everything disrupted. Once they realized there was no damage to the room they left as rudely as they entered with no apology or information provided as to why they invaded our privacy and treated us like street thugs. Again this was 40 in the afternoon in Las Vegas. If you ca n\u2019t scream and yell about a football game in Las Vegas where the heck should you go. Here is the answer Go any place BUT The Cosmopolitan. They are mean they are disrespectful and I would not want my friends family or customers to stay in a place where people are mean disrespectful and rude. One failure can cost you and your company a customer for life. Just like this huge failure cost The Cosmopolitan two customers for life. If you want to go to Las Vegas and have fun you may want to think twice about entering The Cosmopolitan. If you want to hear how lame their \u201c attempted apology \u201d and later \u201c attempted service recovery \u201d were read here. htpcsiinternationalinccomthecosmopolitansucksatservicerecovery The Cosmopolitan \u2019s advertisements use the motto \u201c Just the right amount of wrong \u201d. I \u2019m here to tell you The Cosmopolitan is ALL wrong.

My check in and check out experiences keep me from giving 5 stars. I arrived and there were long lines to check in despite their being at least 12 desk clerks on duty. After several minutes I asked a hotel employee if there was a problem he said that the hotel was hosting several conferences and everyone seemed to be arriving at once. Seemed to me that an efficient operation would anticipate this. After waiting more than 10 minutes another staffer suggested I move to another line. Bad move. 10 more minutes and that line had barely budged while I would already have been checked in if I had not changed. At this point I investigated and saw that my line was being served by only 1 clerk whereas the line I had vacated was being served by four. I was not felng well my problem not the hotels I know. so I was not feeling at all patient. I complained to the hotel staffer who had suggested I move in the first place. He was very apologetic said that there was some confusion about how the lines were supposed to be working and he took me to the VIP line where I quickly got checked in. I know. I know. this sounds like petty complaining but 1 I was not feeling well 2 the lobby is poorly designed with columns that prevent being able to see the desks and 3 management was pretty inept to let it get so bad. You expect more from an expensive venue that bills itself as being luxurious and. well cosmopolitanBut after the initial frustration with check in all went well. I am not a gambler and was in town for a conference so can not comment on the casino except to say that it was not noisy and was not built like a maze as it is in some venues meaning that I could walk across it with a minimum of annoyance to get to my room. I was put in a suite and the room was comfortable and plush though the living room was quite dark. The room had a minibar and kitchenette with sink dishwasher and microwave but no dishes so you will be entirely on your own if you choose to use that facility. Wide screen TV in both rooms and a huge luxurious bathroom with vast shower and a deep square soaking tub next to a window. My room also had a large comfortable furnished terrace. I hate terraces with no furnitureThe hotel meeting rooms were comfortable and well laid out the hotel catering of the conference was much better than average and the hotel restaurants were quite good if overpriced but pricing was typical of Vegas hotels like this. This was the third hotel I have stayed in in Vegas and the nicest. My checkout experience was a breeze but again with a hiccup. As with check in there were lines and no traffic management but as I was trying to figure out which line to get into a hotel employee approached me took my information and promised to email me the bill which allowed me to step right outside where a cab was quickly summoned. Now if only the bill had actually been emailed to me. 25 hours later I am still waiting.

Having read mixed reviews about the Cosmopolitan I was a little apprehensive as I had booked three extra nights at the end of my Insight Great Western American Adventure bus tour which concluded there on Friday 25th September. I have been to Vegas before and was aware that weekends are hectic but initially I found the scale and clientele overwhelming as the majority of guests were under thirty I am mid fifties however after I found my way around I had a pleasant stay. My room was in the west tower on the 27th floor overlooking the pool no balcony. It was very quiet and the bed extremely comfortable. It was a large room with two queen size beds double basin in the bathroom and large walk in glass shower with privacy blind. The linens and towels were a little shabby but the room was clean and housekeeping was always complete when I returned to the room during the day. One aspect I did not like was the fact that there was nowhere within the hotel to get a cheap cool drink It was extremely hot during my visit even for Vegas. You had to go over the walkway to the Miracle Mile of Shops or Walgrens. The ABC shop in MM of Shops had the cheapest cans of soft drink snacks and souvenirs. A highlight was eating at The Wicked Spoon buffet one of the best buffets I have ever seen. The last day of the bus tour included breakfast there and then I treated myself again on the second last day of my stay. It is actually brunch and it is served between 8 am and 2 pm. I recommend having an omelette made and trying the wicked chicken in its own little basket. Delicious. There is everything from fruit hot and cold meat sushi noodles bacon and eggs cakes slices even ice cream you name it is there. It was 3750 US and worth every cent. All the staff I encountered were pleasant and helpful. I had pre booked a ticket to Cirque du Soleil O but others in the tour group wanted to come too. and the concierge organised eight extra tickets but of course they were high up in the balcony. The show was absolutely amazing and just next door at the Belagio. Transport was handy with a Deuce and Express bus stop just outside towards the Belagio. I used this to go to the South Outlets indoor mall North is outdoors and way too hot. I also got the bus on the other side of the strip outside Paris to go to the Venetian and to The Smith Centre to see the musical The Book of Mormons. what a riot of a showOveral I enjoyed my stay even though I felt a little disoriented at the start.

Much to our surprise every time you move one of the items in the mini bar fridge or place something of your own in it they charge you exorbitant amounts for items you did not use. Apparently the inside of the fridge has scales that register a charge on your account every time they are jostled. We were lucky enough to discover this after we were charged over 200 for items we did not use. We were able to straighten it out but wasted a lot of our valuable time doing so.
