OK it \u2019s not downtown La Jola but the fortune you save on the room can be invested in the odd taxi fare or parking charge. The slightly dated motel style with rooms all opening on to the big wide world was for me a plus point and gave added character the downside is that inconsiderate guests making late arrival or early departure noise can be disturbing.
