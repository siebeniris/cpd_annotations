We stayed at the Pullman Da Nang from the 23rd 31st March. Apart from the weather the resort was adequate. The staff in the Infinity Bar and Epice Restaurant were professional courteous and pleasant. That s where it stops. Food in the restaurant was okay but if you have the buffet it was generally cold. The equipment does not seem up to standard to keep it warm. A la carte was generally okay and the head chef was always pleasant and visiting tables. This is where our holiday stopped being fun. We decided to book a hotel car not the cheapedt option to take us to Hue on the Saturday. We went via the Hai Van pass and onto Ko Loc beach. This is where the driver decided to head back to the hotel. It was a dismal 2 hours in the back of a car. At least when we got back to the hotel the Guest service lady was full of aplogies and Mario the FB director tried to make amends. This did nt stop my wife ending up in tears for a day ruined. In turn the Pullman offered another trip free of charge. As my wife really wanted to visit the history of Hue we took up this offer on our last day in Da Nang. That was the biggest mistake of our holiday. We took the Hai Van pass again and nearly made it to Hue this time until we ended up at the police station due to our driver running into the back of another car. The first thing the driver did was get out of the car to check his car. Do nt worry about us hotel guests in the rear of the vehicle. There were 3 vehicles involved in the accident and once the police came everyone ended up at the police station. Including us. I stead of calling the hotel the driver called a colleague to assist him. He then arranged a taxi for us at our expense to visit Hue. We took the taxi to our first drop off and then said goodbye to him. We visited where we wanted to and made our way back to the police station. Our driver then said we could sit in the back of the car for 2 hours until another car came or he was finished. I lost my temper and insisted he call a cab which we caught for the 25 hour ride back to the resort. Once back at the resort no one knew about the accident and the fact 2 hotel guests were involved. Needless to say the apologies and investigations started. The manager at the time offered to discount our stay which was not expected but was a little enticement for the second ruined day of our holiday due to hotel drivers. Upon check out the discount was nowhere to be seen yet another bitter taste to end our holiday on. The Pullman needs some staff customer service training and communications training amongst each other. The story is too long to detail but that is the short version. Wine glasses in the rooms would also be a nice addition. Will think twice about the Pullman for reservations in the future.", "offset": [607, 658], "date": "2015-03-31 00:00:00", "cpt": "0", "category": "transport"}, {"id": 2, "uid": "53bd58e4-b3cf-4bc2-a5ae-d6c3ca0ee8eb", "sentence": "Excellent Place to Stay.

We had not seen each other in 2 years. Living in Sydney and Christchurch we decided to go for our special 50th and 60th birthday to Vietnam. We wanted to experience every thing from a 2 start hotel in Ho Chi to a 5 star hotel in Danang. We wanted to be pampered and be surrounded by warm people. The Pullman was the perfect place for us. Being in a big room with 2 double beds lovely soft linen a great mattress big soft towels great shower options a big desk and a lovely couch. We used the veranda with 2 big chairs overlooking the pool and the sea early morning. The breakfast was included and I have never had such a good variety in my life. The coffees were included and my Latte could stand any competition. The food was top quality and we never needed lunch. The grounds were perfectly kept. The pool was big and blue towels were ready for use on the loungers. The staff were amazing. Nothing was too much and every body was warm and when we took the time to get to know the staff a bit better they took time to have a wee conversation. The staff had a great sense of humour when you started joking with them. One day we did Tai Chi in the morning and the young man was so patient and acknowledging. I forgot his name but he was the perfect teacher. Some staff we got to know are Thuan and Thy who had a great sense of humour and we got welcomed with a big smile when they saw us. Dong picked us up from the airport and took us one day to Hoi An free shuttle service twice a day. He was so keen to give us all the information we needed and his english was pretty good. Vo Phuong Tam has excellent english skills and was very helpful in explaining some issues we had with our debit card. She is a bright lady who will go far. The staff brought us a lot of ice for our drinks and lime all for free. The perfection of how these were presented was amazing. In early evening we would found a little carton on our bed with nougat or biscuits and a bed time story about a legend. I did read these to my friend and she loved them. If we had to say one thing the hotel could improve on it would be having DVDs available or being able to buy movies on screen. The TV was great but we could not find movies at the time we wanted to see them.

We had tried the Kobe beef dinner and international buffet at hotels restaurants and we had to give a thumb up for the food standard. We will definitely visit this hotel again in the near future.

Stayed here for two nights with my significant other. Compared to similar resorts in Danang Pullman was a great deal especially since it is not too far away from the city either as is the case with many other five star resorts there. The biggest problem with the location however is that there are very few good local food places nearby which means you are either stuck eating at the resort settling for some over priced foreign food or taking a long hike or taxi trip downtown for some real local delights. Facilities wise for a layperson to the resort experience Pullman has the complete package. There are plenty of online reviews lauding the quality of Danangs public beaches but Pullmans is obviously a lot better. There are lots of beach activities and classes to sign up for every day. The pool is located to give a semi infinity pool vibe with the beach and ocean stretching beyond the edge. Unfortunately it rained for the entirety of our last day and we could not use the beach to the extent that we had hoped to. The breakfast is top notch a huge range of selections local and foreign. with the banana jam being a particular highlight. We did not get to try the food for other meals which I am sure has the quality to match its price. We also made use of the free shuttle services to Hoi An and the airport be sure to reserve a seat the day before. Simply breathtaking beach and five star facilities all round. There really is not much to do besides enjoying the resort facilities the beach and the sun. Everything else is a taxi ride away. The food choices for room service.

I have to say though Pullman Danang was simply amazing the staff were friendly engaging and genuinely cared they made me feel so welcome I really could have stayed a lot longer. The food in the restaurants and bar was excellent and they really went that extra mile to accommodate any request. Quality and presentation at breakfast was all you could want and more. The rooms are all well positioned with views of the ocean and a balcony to relax on and housekeeping did an excellent job. If going to Danang and wanting to experience the city but also the Ancient Town of Hoi An I would suggest staying here location is the best right on the beach and the beach is stunning powder soft white sand does exist and the ride to the heritage site is only 20 30 minute by taxi if that.

I have book this resort for me and the gf it is not the first 5 star hotel I been to so I feel I can judge this pretty good. The hotel greet us with some ginger. tea upon arrival staff is extremely wonderful Miss Phuong escort us to our room giving us a tour of all the amenities the resorts has to offer so lets start with the review The goods very good bed I stayed at a 3 4 star. hotel in Ho chi minh edenstar even though I paid for the suite the bed was pretty subpar for the price here was better. The biggest disappointment was the view. I paid for the Junior Suite the view is of the street for close to 300 a night. having view of the street is very disappointing. However due to a weird odor in the room we were upgrade to a villa which is superb. however this does nt negate the fact that the junior suite kinda sucks but it does show that the staff will accommodate their guest to the fullest. very good. Miss Phuong awesome guest reception and Miss Thuong Make some awesome drinks at the bar. Breakfast was included and lots and lots of selection and its different each day. They even have Pho OoThe Spa is awesome I got a Spa couple package for around 46mil VND. Son was my masseur he was very very good. my gf says I was having a very good time she says I was snoring and moaning the whole time which I do nt recall but I confirmed with my gf masseuse tho which was also very good according to my gf. After the Spa we stayed in the bathtub which was full of roses and enjoy a glass of wine which is included with the price very romantic. The location is pretty decent the hotel does not have a casino however its a 15 usd taxi ride to the nearest Casino do nt expect las vegasThe Bad The Junior suite is not very good as far as the view goes it as simple as that if you want the view of the ocean your best bet is to upgrade or downgrade to another spot other than Junior Suite or find another hotel. I address to one of the reception manager I think his name was son too regarding the hotel lacking activities for families andor single traveler. I offer suggestion such as Latin night live music or games like speed dating things that will engage the guest into doing activities at night. All these things are things I seen in the past with other 5 star hotel. This is the first 5 star hotel that does not offer anything.

We have just returned from an amazing 10 night stay at the beautiful Pullman Danang and could not fault the resort at all. The staff were amazing and could not do enough to make your stay just perfect particularly the concierge Ahn was so helpful and the lovely staff at breakfast and the Infinity Bar. When shown to our room we were speechless as it was like a self contained villa overlooking the pool and the private beach with a wonderful outdoor shower. paradise. Breakfast buffet was great and room service was always delicious. We did try the Seafood Beach BQ buffet and were a little disappointed as we were not told there was also food inside the restaurant as well as what was outside. The hotel is in a great location about 10 mins taxi ride to get to Da Nang. Also a hotel shuttle to Hoi An which takes about 30 mins. There were a few restaurants to the right outside the hotel in walking distance recommend Lam Vien. We enjoyed massages at the spa which were not too expensive for a 5 star hotel. We did try a massage over the road from the hotel but beware as they request a minimum tip from you before you leave the room. The only thing we felt was lacking was a little shop to buy necessities in the hotel as there is really nowhere close outside the hotel either. The Lobby Bar was also lovely to sit in and look out over the beach listening to the brilliant guitar player.

Just that the waves were always there so you ca nt expect a relaxful swim by the beach. But there is a lifeguard always watching over so you can swim with the waves. The pool is heated which means a lot esp during night swimming. If I only had 1 negative feedback on the hotel its that they could nt break my 10dolar bill in the front desk. I badly needed it to pay my tour guide. It was a hassle. Front desk told me they were not allowed to hold foreign currency. But for a 5 star hotel i think you should esp USD bills. But overall this hotel met and exceeded all my expectations. Location was perfect in the middle of the city with its own private beach front which I think was the best beachfront. Airport was just 15 to 20mins away. They offered free shuttle bus to Hoi An 2x a day. I wish they had more though like 3 or 4x a day since its only 45mins away. We wanted to catch a cooking tour at 1 pm but no shuttle time met this time so we had to book a separate ride. But for the price you pay its all perfect and valur for money.
