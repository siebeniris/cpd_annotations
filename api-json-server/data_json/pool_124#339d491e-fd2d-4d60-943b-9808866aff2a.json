This was done and we enjoyed the rest of the stay. There are two bar areas to choose from neither of which we found to have a flavoured Gin on offer knowing how the trend for flavoured Gins is at the moment this surprised me we were told it was due to space they did have about 5 standard branded Gins so surely one of these could be replaced with a flavoured one just an idea. The swimming pool facilities were clean there was one small jacuzi so if there was someone else in you had to wait til they had finished and then you could have a quick turn.
