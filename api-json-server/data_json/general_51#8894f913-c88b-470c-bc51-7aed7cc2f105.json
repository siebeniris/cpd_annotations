The hotel looks great and the location artificial beach pool and view of the ships coming and going is really nice. Also the quality of the food is good. But service and amenities are terrible. The staff is indeed very friendly. It sort of breaks my heart to make this review because they are really nice people. But the service is amateurish. We paid 500 USD extra for a balcony with a city view. We got a balcony towards a mud field and a heavily trafficked backroad where pickup trucks cars w the radio on at max volume and construction machinery run back and forth most of the late evenings nights. We can not use the balcony to sit outside and the noise goes on until well beyond midnight. For a better view they request an additional 300 USD on top of what I already paid extra. As for many others who have written reviews lack of hot water and no water pressure in the shower. Have you ever tried to wash your hair in a gentle summer rain. Two days we have not had enough water to turn the shower on and a third day the water pressure dropped to zero and the shower turned itself off when I was half way through a hair wash. One day we only had ice cold water. Cleaning half of the days we have stayed we have had to call or search for staff to get our room cleaned. They were cleaning the neighbours room when we left at 10 am and still our room had not been cleaned when we got back at 4 pm. One day they came so early that we were still in bed and when we asked to have our room cleaned later she did not understand English but never came back at all. Another day they did not come to clean until 6 pm. do not expect to have your bed made. They just put the blanket back on top so that it looks like it has been made. We had sand in our bed but still the bed linen were not changed. Beach service there is suppose to be staff taking orders of drinks at the beach. But they come around very seldom. For the entire first week of our stay we did not even realise that we were suppose to be able to order at the beach. Restaurants. food is great once if you get it. Extremely slow service. 40 minutes wait for toasted bread or fries. Several times we have had to point out that we are still waiting. Once we got the wrong food when it came. Once they forgot to return a 14 dollar change. do not order the buffet. 38 dollars without drinks. a main course from the menu costs less than half that. Be somewhat careful about Budget car rental that the hotel houses at its property. They require a 500 USD deposit and upon return they inform you of new fees that had not been mentioned earlier and are not in the contract.

My wife and I had a wonderful vacation staying at this hotel. The location was perfect. The infinity pool was awesome and so relaxing. We stayed on the 4th floor with an ocean view. It was a great room. The balcony had two chairs and a table to relax on after our days of exploring the beaches. There was a cruise ship docked on Monday and Thursday which did not bother us. Thought it was pretty cool. Lots of other ships passed by the hotel throughout the week. Again it did not bother us. We rented a car. Which I recommend. The hotel has free parking which was a bonus. It took a little bit getting to know our way around the Island but we visited 5 beaches with Playa Porte Mari being our favorite. It was great snorkeling and easy for beginners. At Playa Lagun We did see a sea turtle up close which was pretty cool. The service at the hotel was great. All the staff were very friendly and helpful. The hotel restaurants were average. We did have a great dinner at the Infinity Beach Bar and Grill and our waitress. Bianca was great. We were not crazy about our meal at the Anchor restaurant. Better choices at the other restaurants. Had a great dinner at the Bahia right outside the hotel area in Rif Fort. Did the breakfast buffet at the hotel. It was okay but pricey. Went to Denys another day it was up the road. It was just mediocre. Then had a bagel at Starbucks two of the the other days. All in all we had an awesome vacation and the stay at the hotel was great.

We are currently on day 3 of our 7 day tripand so far I have nothing but rave reviews about this hotel. A short background hubby wanted to go somewhere family friendly with a casino for his 40th birthday. And while we are not fans of overly industrialized countries we decided Cura\u00e7ao would be the perfect fit for the two of us and our 20 month old. Everyone working here is so friendly. Our babe is super friendly and the staff here entertaining her and being extremely helpful with her. While we did not opt for the all inclusive there are tons of restaurants within a short walk of the hotel. We enjoy trying the local food and meeting other tourists in the area. You can get pay 25 for the buffet breakfast but on our first morning here we ordered from the a la carte menu which was cheaper and a great portion. If you are looking to be directly on the beach then this hotel may not be for you. There is a small man made beach along with a small infinity pool perfect to keep an eye on our toddler. Hubby has thoroughly enjoyed the casino. Smoke free and big enough for him to get his blackjack and roulette fix. Location is within amazing proximity to the city. Lots of shopping and restaurants as well as tourist sites.

The only incident that left a bitter taste on our mouths occurred on last day prior to our departure at hotel. A member of their staff stopped us when he saw us going towards hotel elevators to ask us to show him our room key. We questioned him as we had been staying there 7 days n no one had ever asked us. He responded it was hotel policy starting from that day on. We asked him then why was he not asking the people standing next to us who happened to be of Caucasian persuasion. He was very arrogant. We reported it to main lobby who gave us a crappy excuse but never the less apologized profusely. I suggest this hotel screen n train their staff better in customer service.

We arrived at the hotel around 7 pm after a transatlantic flight and our 4yo fell asleep in the car. The bellman helped us quick with our luggage so we could carry our daughter into the hotel. Check in went swift and we were escorted to our room. Unfortunately the elevators were a bit off already so it took a while to get up to the 4th floor. The room was very spacious and the beds were really nice. We had asked for an extra rolaway bed but unfortunately it was not possible with our 2 queen beds. Also the requested extra towels we could nt find. We did nt eat yet so we decided to order romservice. The ordering went very pleasant and the food was delivered within the said time. Food was well presented and good. We had drinks and we also got glasses of water and extra ice. Next morning we decided not to have breakfast in the hotel. The price for breakfast in this hotel is too high for the amount our family eats for breakfast. We walked ofsite to eat breakfast at Denys. After breakfast we went to the pool on the 2nd floor. The beach with the pool was fantastic and the temperature of the water was great. There are many beachbeds and the towels are provided for free but they are a bit small especially if you are a bit larger then average. Checkout went swift and good.

We liked this resort. We had a nice room overlooking the ocean and cruise ships and pool. The bed was comfortable and the room was spacious.

The pool is better the drink selection is better Starbucks inside the hotel is included in the all inclusive in Aruba the Starbucks in the lobby is not includedThe man made beach pool is great. You would not know you are in a pool you would think you were at the beach. We did go to the beach one day but preferred the hotel pool even though we are beach people. It was private secluded only hotel guests and great view of the cruise ships coming and going. One night we watched a move from the ship this is how close it was to us. Food was great casino is in the lobby for those who like to gamble or those that want to waste 20 on a rainy night. The drinks in the casino are free unlike the Casino in the Renaissance in Aruba. It is a great location you can walk all over downtown see the bridge lots of nice shops in walking distance cobblestone streets etc. I liked being able to look out your room and see the architecture. I would recommend this resort. If you are trying to decide between Renaissance Aruba and Renaissance Curacao no question it is the Renaissance Curacao. Better rooms better service better location nicer pool and more culture. If you are used to the typical all inclusive and trying to decide between resorts in Curacao many people I met on the plane went to Sunscape as it was cheaper but on the plane on the way back they complained about many things. If you want to see the architecture explore downtown its great to walk on both sides if you like walking and see all the areas of town we did 2 hours on side 2 hours the other just exploring the different homes. If you want to sit on the beach and relax and not see anything you can do so by the pool here but you may like another resort.

Check in was easy we did the all inclusive option which was pretty good value even though we were not in the resort most of the day the prices worked out. Even the starbucks inside hotel was part of the all inclusive that was amazing because we can take food to go when we went to local beaches. The rooms were clean and spacious. Drinks were good.

On Mondays they drain pool to clean so if you were plan excursion do it then. We planned ours based off prior reviewer tip so it worked out. Other then that I suggest you check out local beaches we went to blue beach and if you do n\u2019t mind driving farther out visit playa Kenepa so beautiful. Bring water shoes since their beaches are more rockier. Every shops are all in walking distance you can cross over bridge as well as many restaurants for those who did nt choose all inclusive option.
