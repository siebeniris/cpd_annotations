You are grated with a glass or 3 of Proseco sparkling wine which helps take the edge off. the grounds including pool and hot tubs are beautiful and filled with flowers and fruit trees as they meander in between the rooms. With our room came breakfast which included mimosas specialty egg dishes pastries juice and coffee. all you wanted. We started the day with coffee and scones while enjoying the outdoor spa. We had dinner in the wine cellar room which was romantic. great dinner selection changes daily.

The spa area is still closed but I got a lovely massage in the temporary location which was very pleasant and peaceful. While the hotel is directly on Highway 12 the design of the buildings around a series of little courtyards and the number of fountains made the highway noise negligible. My room 11 looked down on the pool area which is sometimes a drawback. But in this case there was no noise from other guests and a waterfall splashing into the pool provided soothing sounds.

The room was charming. They already had the fireplace running with a bottle of champagne chilling. Also waiting for us was a delicious cookie a box of chocolates and a welcoming note. The balcony to our room which overlooked the pool had a bistro table and chairs. Every night they had a wine tasting from a small local winery with an accompaniment of cheese and crackers. In the morning the served a complimentary breakfast. They had an egg dish French toast bacon potatoes fresh fruit yogurt with fresh fruit cups and an assortment of breads and pastries.

Undercoked bland overpriced and pre made we asked for less chese not possible bc it was all pre made. Tasted like a bad frozen pizza. Very few options for food which is a shame and surprise for such a nice property. Service indifferent verging on cold. Concierge Sebastian was a stand out in a good way. The rest of the staff was indifferent esp front desk. Today Friday drilling and construction at the pool so not usable. I know the spa is closed but now the pool as well. Huge letdown. And the workers seemed to go out of their way to be extra loud for example dropping wheel barrels slamming chairs around. I get they have to do work but could be a little more mindful.

And our room was right in front of the spa which was being worked on with hydraulic equipment so the noise was very loud and the spa could not be used. My husband was told he could get coffee and croissants at 60AM but only coffee was available until 830AM. Basically the breakfast staff seemed uninterested in providing pleasant or good service.

First time staying in the California wine region and chose this hotel for 3 nights largely by Tripadvisor reviews as so many perfect reviews. Does the sun and beautiful surroundings cloud one \u2019s judgementThe property is visually a delightful on arrival and the front desk staff friendly. Being a small establishment check in was instant and we were directed to our large room. The Mediterranean rustic theme pervades throughout but perhaps this masks areas that could benefit from a little TLC notably the breakfast room. The gardens are a pleasure the pool large and well heated nice clean furniture to relax on. A popular area for \u201c girly groups \u201d but no issue at all whilst we were there. We have stayed in bed and breakfasts from east to west coast with many offering a complimentary hour of wine and canap\u00e9s. Here this is in the wine room but given by one of the local wineries so just a very small measure of a couple of their wines some excellent. The cheese and crackers are provided by the inn but much the same each evening. The Kenwod is close to many of these wine estates so it is easy and convenient to visit them. There are tickets in the lobby offering 2 for1 tastings at many. The breakfast was good but not exceptional. The granola tasty a large plate of cut fruit which was not overly inspiring a large warming pan of a hot item and muffins. This was all a serve yourself buffet with fruit juice and coffee. It would be so nice if coffee was poured at the table by staff. Now for the bedroom. What I did not like was the paper cups by the coffee machine in the room. Each day pods for 4 drinks were left but only three paper cups so one had to be washed. Never in a 45star hotel have I ever had paper cups. Perhaps there is an issue that china ones might be dropped on the tiled floors but at the price of these rooms there should better. The bed was extremely comfortable and the bedding good quality. Plenty of towels in the bathroom and L\u2019Ocitane toiletries. It is good to see that the inn is trying to reduce plastic waste from small bottles of shampoos etc with larger refilable units. One cooler evening the gas fire in the room was a very welcome addition making it cosy and inviting. Everything was spotlessly clean the housekeeping first rate. It is a great shame that there is not a small bar open in the evening offering some quality light food even if only small rather than room service pizza or the like as this would really enhance the ambience of this lovely old inn. We did not use the spa so can not comment.
