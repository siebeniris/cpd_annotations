Booked this hotel after reading the good reviews however i do feel slightly disappointed. We came for my husbands birthday and upon knowing this the staff very kindly upgraded us free of charge to an executive room the room however was my main disappointment with it being an executive room i was expecting a nice room what we got was very average and in need of modernisation. The bed was comfortable and it was mostly clean apart from a few hairs in the bathroom the furniture was very tired as was the carpet and decor i found it really depresingThere is an indoor pool with spa and sauna which is free to use it is nice to have this facility however this again was very tired and in need of a revamp there was grime around the spa are. After speaking with other guests we also got the impression from the spas paying members that they do not particularly like the hotel guests being thereWe did not try the jacuzi as there was a queue and whenever one person got out another lept in. Changing rooms are communal and do not have private changing areas. Ladies Mens are separateWe chose to dine in the grill restaurant as it sounded impressive yet again this was not great. The menu is very limited and offers steak and roughly 6 other options for the mains. Prices are steep my husband had a burger and fries \u00a3 16 and i had the risotto 1395 he was happy with the burger but my risotto consisted of plain rice with two carrots and broccoli there was no flavour or sauce whatsoever. I have tried many risottos and never had one like this before i was guted i had wasted money on it i did tell a member of staff who brought me some sauce and parmesan however i felt like i was having to make my own dish. There were alot of elderly guests in the restaurant who seemed to be together they were eating from a buffet looks like it was part of their hotel package. it did give it a canteen feel and was not what we expected it kind of feels like they have added a few tables and chairs to a spare area of the hotel and called it a restaurant i would not recommend it. Breakfast was excellent with a wide variety for some reason another guest felt it appropriate to walk around the restaurant without shoes however that is obviously no fault of the hotelsStaf are all very friendly and helpful every member of staff we saw spoke to us. There are nice extras left in the room like slippers a sleep well pack and temple spa toiletries. Parking was available and secure at \u00a3 10 which is average for a Leeds hotel. Wifi is payable however you do get a complimentary session for two devices.

I went to Leeds with my husband as he had business there and I had a day off. We picked a central hotel so I could go off and explore while he worked. This hotel is nicely located in the city centre with an easy walk to the main shopping areas and places of interest. The desk gave me a map as I had never visited Leeds before. There was some work going on in the foyer but nothing to disrupt the service. We arrived very early for check in 10 am which I knew and never expected a room to be ready but I had to be dropped early because of my husbands job that day. I thought the man on the desk was a little snipy we were so early not letting me explain I did not expect a room before announcing there is no room. I left my case there and went off into the city. I returned just before 2 pm and there was no rooms ready so I had a very nice lunch in the bar area. I had expected someone to maybe just give me a nod when a room was ready but I had to keep checking and watching others get their rooms while I still waitedRom 207 was a little tired and assume it is still to be refurbished. But it was clean and nice with plenty of room for us to move around etc. Bathroom with bath and shower also clean with toiletries provided. I went to the spa area and spent a lovely hour swimming going in sauna and steam room and whirl pool. All clean and well kept. Remember to take a \u00a3 1 coin with you for the lockers though. I had forgotten as took nothing with me other than my costume and clothes. The lady on the spa desk leant me a coin with me leaving my room key so they got it backThe biggest down side of our whole stay which stops me giving more stars was the noise. There was a wedding in the hotel the same night we were there and I think room 207 must be directly above the dance floor. It was almost like being there I could hear the lyrics to the songs so our TV was up quiet loud so we could hear it. The music stopped around midnight I think as I was so tired after an early start that morning I just lay in bed trying to get to sleep and stopped looking at the clock. I expect some noise from the corridor at hotels etc but not a full disco in my room. The bed was also too hard for me so not a brilliant night sleep but pillows were comfortable. The buffet breakfast had a good selection of what I had expect from a buffet breakfast at a hotel like this. Although the pastries and muffins had run out by 100am when we were eating. Also having a tea coffee station to help yourself would be better than waiting to be offered served by someone walking round. We waited nearly 10 minutes before someone finally offered hot drinks but not decaf so I asked for hot water to put my our decaf teabag in which took more time to arrive and I chased it.

Room was good very clean and modern. TV lacks some channels but is acceptable. Went to the spa changing rooms are a bit shabby and no private cubicles is always a bug bear with me but pool is ok and steam room sauna are good. We ordered from the room service menu food was good. No complaints there. However at about 8 pm the problems started. We were on the second floor and our room was clearly right above their function room. We may as well have been on the dance floor and enjoying the party. The music was really loud and we could pretty much here the DJ word for word. It was loud enough for us not to be able to hear the TV without turning it up ridiculously high. As we were planning on just relaxing in our room for the evening I rang down to Reception to ask what was happening and how long it was going to go on for. When she said it would be going on till 1 am I suggested that we were not going to have a relaxed evening with that level of noise going on beneath us. Her response was well we are a hotel. We do have functions on at the weekend rather than an acknowledgement that another function of a hotel is to provide a place where people can relax in peace and quiet. The irony of looking at their advice leaflet about how to get a good nights sleep whilst she was telling me this was not lost on us. Eventually she suggested that we could be moved to another room and said she would talk to the manager and rings us straight back. Half an hour later I rang her back to ask what was happening. She said they were bringing us alternative room keys up and asked if we had got our things together so we could be moved. not sure how we were supposed to know that we were being moved without her having rung us back to let us know that was hapeningWhen we did get to our new room on the fifth floor we were very pleased to take it. It was lovely and quiet and again very clean and comfortable. I can not complain about the rooms at all. We had a peaceful evening and fell asleep content that we had eventually been treated well. Sadly that did not last. At half past midnight we were woken up by someone trying hard to get into our room. Luckily I had locked the room from the inside otherwise we would have been woken up by strangers actually coming into the room. I went to the door to see what was going on but whoever had been trying the door had gone. This was followed a few minutes later by the phone ringing and reception asking why we were in that room can you tell me your name because nobody is supposed to be in that room. as if we had somehow snuck into the room without permission. I pointed out that they they were the ones who had moved us and that we had been in the room since half past 8. I asked if that is why someone had been trying our door and she said that they had been trying to move someone else into that room which was coming up as empty on their system. Again I pointed out that we had been moved much earlier in the evening at which point she said well I am sorry for disturbing you and put the phone down as if somehow we were the ones at fault. Having been so rudely awakened and spoken to so rudely it was then hard to get back to sleep and this really did affect the rest of our night. I was upset that someone could have walked into our room and by the way we were questioned as to why we were in that room. In the morning we asked to speak to the manager but he did not seem to really understand that this was an upsetting experience. He put it down to a system error and was reluctant to apologise. He did eventually offer a 50 refund on the food and waved the parking charge but it felt like a half hearted gesture caused by our refusal to let it lieit is disappointing that we were made to feel on each of those occasions as if our concerns were unreasonable. it is a hotel they have functions expect to put up with noise. it is a system error it is perfectly acceptable to send someone up to your room in the middle of the night.

I booked a one night stay at the Crowne Plaza as a birthday treat for my partner myself and our daughter. We had looked through lots of hotels in Leeds and our daughter chose this one because of the location of the hotel and because of the amazing pool area that we wanted to relax in. Being an IHG member I booked the hotel weeks in advance on the ap and set my travel preferences which I love when staying at a Crowne Plaza. Imagine my disappointment when I received and e mail a week before our stay saying that the pool area would be closed due to refurbishment. I was surprised that there was nothing on the ap or website giving information saying that the pool would be closed. I rang the front desk to ask about this and was told I could either stay at the hotel or cancel my booking. Ok so that was the first blot on the copy book. As I explained earlier I had already set up my travel preferences and asked for and early check in and also a room in a quiet zone away from the lifts. We got there about 10 and was told that because the hotel was full our room was not ready. That was ok as early check in is not always available. We left our bags and wandered into the City for the afternoon. When we got back to the hotel we checked in and went to our room. No sooner had we stepped out of the lift then we came across our room. It could not have been any nearer to the lift and was certainly not in a quiet zone. We had booked a king bed room with a sofa bed for our daughter I had also booked a bottle of proseco in the room as an extra on the website. Neither the sofa bed was made up nor was the proseco waiting for us in the room. I went downstairs to reception and explained my disappointment in the location of the room the lovely lady behind reception said that there were no rooms to move us to as the hotel was full. I asked about the proseco and she said that there was no record of it on my booking I paid and about 10 minutes later it was delivered to our room not quite as romantic as I wanted it. I asked about the sofa bed and the lady explained again that there was not reference for it being done on my booking despite the booking being for 2 adults and 1 child. The lady assured us that the sofa bed would be made up later in the evening when we went out for a meal. About 90 we got back to the hotel. We decided to have a quick drink in the bar and I took our coats up to the room. Again I found that the sofa bed had not been made up while we were out. I went back downstairs again and explained to a different person about the sofa bed. She said that she knew nothing about it but would get it done at that moment and she would come and find us in 10 minutes in the bar. 20 minutes went by and I asked the same girl behind reception but she said she had forgotten to ask anyone to do it. 40 minutes and one very tired little girl. later I went up to reception to ask yet again if it had been made up. I was told it had been done but as they were so busy they had not had the time to come and find us. So we went up for the night and to be honest I was woken up several times by noisy guests coming out of the lift and shouting godnight to each other. It certainly was not the best sleep I had every hadI know you will think I am moaning a lot so I will gloss over the chaotic breakfast in a room far too small to cope with a full hotel. I can not fault the staff at the hotel who tried their best to help with all the little disappointments with the stay. When checking out we were told that our drinks from the bar while waiting for the sofa bed to be made up would be on the house.
