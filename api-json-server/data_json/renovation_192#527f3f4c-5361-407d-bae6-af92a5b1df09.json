The concierge recommended and made reservations for us a delightful restaurant in Georgetown. On every level the service was superb. I must say however I have stayed at the hotel Washington before and have always loved the traditional elegance. When I lived in dc I enjoyed many late afternoons at the rooftop bar. I am not a fan of the Art Deco refurbishing. The prior warmth of the rooms is gone. The hallway in darkish purple black seems more ripe for a horror film rather than a cozy weekend getaway. Frankly it was creepy. The rooms were primarily white with some gray accents. The beds were comfortable but there was a certain coldness in the ultra modern atmosphere. With the non sealing sliding glass bathroom door there was no way to assure privacy. The rooftop bar has one of the most beautiful views in the city. The crowd there is decidely for the younger crowd. Being over 40 made one fell very out of place. The staff at the door all but greeted us withrealy. You seriously want to come in.

This was my 2nd time to stay here. I stayed a few years back when it had first opened. Our arrival was welcomed by incredibly nice valet guys who allowed my friend to park his car with them for a few minutes while he came in to check out the hotel with me he would not be staying. The lobby and check in area is very nicely appointed and well maintained. I really like the caricatures of the Presidents behind the Welcome Desk. The gentleman checking me in was decently welcoming. I hinted around about a possible room upgrade with my SPG elite status. But he did not accommodate even though my stay was on a Monday night in which the hotel seemed at fairly low occupancy. My first stay here had a large room overlooking the treasury building out front. This time I had a room at the far end of the hallway looking on a side street. The room decor was pretty much the same as my first time. However they have remodeled the POV lounge on the roof. The outdoor terrace was nice enough with the amazing views. The indoor area was still under construction. I loved it inside there back in 209 our mixologist was incredible then so were my petite filet of beef and drinks. But the menu and bar area have changed. A space was roped off on the terrace reserved for a party. But no one ever came. I dined up there that evening and again the next day for lunch. I noticed the new restaurant was nicely appointed and liked how they have brought it to life a little more than when it was JG Steakhouse. I love the location and always enjoy walking around checking everything out. My last visit included a stay at the nearby St Regis. it is such a nice place as well. In my opinion the rooms in both the St Regis and the W could use a bit of a refresh. Would also like to see the hallways livened up a bit. Overall I enjoyed my stay. The beds are quite comfy. The rooms are enjoyable. I plan to stay here again very soon. I also want to check out The Fairfax at Embassy Row and have enjoyed the recently opened Le Meridien just across the Potomac from Georgetown.", "offset": [1684, 1768], "date": "2015-08-18", "cpt": "0", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 2, "uid": "7f59a441-bd87-41ad-b923-22e04e2ebc69", "sentence": "Best Washington Location. Our business client chose W Washington for its proximity to their corporate meeting but it could not be closer to the heart of DC. behind the Treasury building near the Mall the White House and plenty more. My room was clean functional and quite comfortable. I did not request or pay for a room with a view so there was no disappointment at overlooking a landlocked yard below and that may have helped isolate me from DC traffic noise in fact. The W Washington is a conversion of a grand old Washington hotel redecorated in the iconic trendy W style interestingly although the room and furnishings are crisp and do not show inappropriate wear the trendy decor seems somehow dated. all the highly designed halogen lighting would certainly be LED fixtures these days and textures and palettes would be different.

We stayed here with our family for 4 nights while on a road trip in de US and Canada. Although we had to wait very long for check in even if we are platinum SPG members. we were rewarded with wonderful rooms with a view on the white house. The staff of the front desk and the concierges were very helpful and friendly. The rooms were a little bit tiny. but we heard they are going to renovate and change the rooms to make them more spacious. Everything was quite nice BUT the breakfast. I have seldom experienced such unfriendly arrogant unhelpful and actually RUDE staff. So after our first breakfast we thought we will not return here for breakfast and just had 2 days of good and friendly breakfasts in the Pain Quotidien. But the last day of our stay we decided to give it another chance maybe we had been there on a bad day. So we tried again something we NEVER should have done. The service was even worse than the first day. The hostess just ignored us when we walked in with the children. And when we asked for a table of 6 there were plenty of tables available at the time. she first helped several other persons before helping us. Then when I asked here if it was possible to put 2 tables together for us to be able to sit down for breakfast she just shoved two tables together without removing the excess chairs or cutlery and plates. Then the waiter came to us to take our order but he was so rude not listening and unkind he even walked away while we were still ordering. We asked to speak to the manager he was very helpful and friendly and listened to our complaints.

After the W Downtown in NYC lost my laundry and never resolved the issue I took a break from the W I decided to give another shot at the W Washington 9 months later. It was a sorely disappointing experience. For context I am a platinum elite member with Mariot and typically really enjoy the properties. I was surprised to find the service at this property severely lacking expectations. When I arrived the hotel was undergoing severe renovations. I get it. You do not advertise this. The doors need to stay open. But to charge the rates you do and maintain your brand service needs to be on point in these periods. I shared the following feedback with the hotels GM after checkout in response to an email from their deskTo be honest I left fairly unimpressed with this stay. I was not aware of the renovation but that happens and business must go on. I would expect however that service levels remain at or above par when the facility itself is not at peak condition. Some examples of what left me unimpressed I arrived Sunday night in the pouring rain. The two doormen outside stood at their turnstiles watching me get out of my uber. I was not looking for help with luggage anyway but I had expect an umbrella or some willingness to step out and offer service. I checked in at 230. The original room I was offered 412 was very lackluster especially for a platinum guest. I typically request a high floor so I do not have to hear street traffic. I was instead placed on the 4th floor across from the elevator this must be one of the worst rooms in the hotel. Then I was moved to an unrenovated room 729 again pretty lackluster. There was mildew around the outside of the shower. I went to use the business center and had to wait until the folks around the concierge desk stopped watching videos on their phone before I was pointed in the right direction. I came down to the lobby with a question in the afternoon. Waiting in line for the front desk there were 4 staff members around chatting or milling about nobody offered to assist me until I got to the desk. I did have an excellent meal in the restaurant and service was fantastic throughout. Aditionaly I utilized the business center which had a broken computer and one working computer with absurd rates. The GM Meade never even bothered to respond.
