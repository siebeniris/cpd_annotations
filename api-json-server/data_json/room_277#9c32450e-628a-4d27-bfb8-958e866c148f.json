We stay at the hotel two nights in 3 double rooms and 1 king suite for a very calm bachelorette party. Make sure you lock up your belongings or take with you.

Once we left the room they cleaned the bathroom took the money and left the room dirty and beds unmade. Making it look like they were not there. We told the front desk of the situation and they basically said that this happens all the time and we would not get the girls money back. Very sad that you are Paying for 4 rooms for two nights during an expensive Memorial Day weekend and they will not do jack about it. They have the surveillance to check to see who entered the room but refuse to do anything about their theft problem. Besides that major issue the beds are tiny to share the plumbing is slow that each shower had standing water and the safes in each room were locked and unable to be accessed. The live music was nice at the hotel the Starbucks staff was overly friendly and the buffet food menu was really good. The walk to Broadway was perfect and their shuttle service was great for farther walks.

This is by far the worst Double tree experience. The hotel is so run down the walls are so thin you can technically hear the guy snore from the room down the hall. I paid 250 USD for one night and expected a room that matched the price and the standard of Hilton. I was there for one night and I had to urge the manager to give me a room before I passed out due to exhaustion. I had a gig to attend in 2 hours from the time I checked in. The manager did help but when I walked into my room. It was like I walked into a 2 star hotel. The bathroom looked less than desirable. It was tiny with stained marks in the tub. The shower curtain did not stop the water from getting out of the tub so you ended up with a pool on the floor each time you took a shower. I had to call front desk 4 times in total and waited for 40 minutes for a toothbrush and toothpaste. I was puzzled to why the basic amenities were not in the room. I would usually be ok with the wait if it was not the fact I barely rested in those 2 hours due to the constant noise had to leave for the gig and desperately needing to freshen up. I am sure there are better hotels in the area for this price and with better service and quality.

My best friend and myself arrived at the hotel around 11 am Friday November 24th hotel check in is late 4 pm. so the gentlemen we dealt with told us to come back in about 1 2hrs he provided us with a map and different places we could grab something to eat in the meantime. We arrive back two hours later he was no longer there so we dealt with a short blonde girl with curly hair we asked if there were any rooms available yet she said no they have not even gotten to the rooms with double beds yet so we had asked if it was possible to change our reservation to a single bed her response was No we are sold out. We had decided to not waste our time there and start getting ready in the lobby bathroom we take our luggage to the bathroom start getting our make up out and within 10 minutes of us leaving the front desk we received a text message informing us our room was ready. I was kind of annoyed that she could not have even asked the cleaning staff considering we were JUST there. Upon trying to get to our room the elevator got stuck. Thankfully another hotel guest was able to get us out after another 5 10 minutes. We finally get to our room looked nice enough at first glace upon spending a few nights there we noticed1. The bathtub was kind of gross and the cleaning staff who had JUST been in there could not even put the plug back in the drain. It looked like it was just tossed in the tub2. Every time you used the sink it would make weird noises3. The light in the hallway would buzz loud and anoyingly4. The bathroom has sliding doors one of the doors was completely ripped off the bottom slide so the door would come off from the bottom every time you used it5. THE DUVETS WERE DISGUSTING. The last night we stayed we realized that the duvet had come out of the cover and it there was a huge gross brown stain on it. NOT what I would expect from a Double Tree. When we went to check out my best friend was talking to the girl who the first day had told us the hotel was sold out she was listing the issues we had with our rooms so they could take note of them as this lady was writing them down she said they may be able to do something for us but had to get her manager. When the manager of the facility arrived she had the note her co worker had written out for her listing the issues. When glancing on the note the bottom read girl is a bth when I asked them to hand me the note they panicked and said there were other customers behind me they needed to deal with there were two gentlemen. Not one for making a scene we left to grab food and cool off before trying to deal with the situation again. When we returned the manager had flipped the script and was super nice and helpful and apologetic towards my best friend. When I suggested additional training be issued to staff who we are quite apparently missing professionalism training I was assured by her that all employees had undergone sufficient training. So from my understanding they train their employees to call guests a bth when THEIR rooms are not up to par.

We were extremely happy to have stayed so close to all the action of downtown. Our rooms were perfect for what we needed and the hotel as a whole was great. We arrived to Nashville at 80am. We called for early check in at 530 that morning and were placed on the early list. We were told we were second on the list so when we checked at 10pm to see if there was a room available they advised it was being cleaned and it would be about a 20 minute wait. We opted to stay in the lobby to wait. After an hour went by and we had not been called about our room being ready we went and checked again. The staff at the front told us they were still cleaning the room. After 2 and a half hours we were finally able to check in. This was 30 minutes before our normal check in time. We watched as other patrons were able to check in and go to their rooms before us. This was unacceptable and frustrating. We stayed for three nights and the hotel cleaning service did not clean our room once. On our second day there housekeeping showed up at 830 at night asked to clean our room but we were in it. The third day there they showed up at 90 am asking to come in and clean. We were still getting up. We had to travel around the hotel to ask for new towels.
