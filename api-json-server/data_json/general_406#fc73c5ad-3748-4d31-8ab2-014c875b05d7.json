Front desk people very helpful i had issues with my room key twice and they resolved it very quickly for me. Location is great close to Miami beach by car and close to Key Biscayne please where i was workingThey have a business center with computer and printers which was very useful for me free of chargeThey also have close to the business center 2 screens showing the arrivals and departures from MIA. Miami international airportNot so good things. The room looked very very old. the furniture was so old and not nice at all the iron was rusted. There was no minibar so no fridge to keep cold drinks nothing. The room had an old TV n not flat screen and the tv did nt work. NO FREE INTERNET IN THE ROOM this was not good at all they only offer free internet in the Lobby. i was going to rate 4 but removed one to rate 3 due to this it caused me some issues to have to go to the Lobby 5 am US time 10 am UK time to access important emails. Shower very old and dirty the bathroom was all wet after i had shower. The breakfast continental is a joke real joke it is a juice cafe and a croissant and that is it however if you pay to upgrade to a full breakfast they have very good cold and hot food options. Overall good stay if they include internet in the rooms and offer a proper breakfast i would be more than happy to return every time i need to go to Miami for work.", "offset": [287, 582], "date": "2015-03-06", "cpt": "0", "category": "general"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "04e37031-5360-4a84-9958-9bee53c20a01", "sentence": "Great customer service at this hotel.

Trip organised by Travelbag Chester. Included transport from airport to hotel in Miami. Hotel to cruise terminal in Fort Lauderdale and from Fort Lauderdale back to Miami airport after the cruise. We were not met at the airport as arranged. The transport from the hotel arrived 2 hours early and departed. The transport from the cruise terminal to the airport also failed to arrive. Travebag has offered a refund but as yet it has not been received. CRUISEThis was our second cruise with Holland America but never again. On arrival at the cruise terminal we discovered the evening meal had been brought forward by 30 minutes to 515pm This was much to early so we opted to go for turning up as and when. We also discovered that the daily gratuity had been increased from 150 to 1250 again with no prior advance notice. The cruise ship Nieuw Amsterdam left port on time for our tour around the Caribbean. Our Cabin was clean and well serviced throughout the cruise. Evening meals in the main restaurant were at times disappointing. Service was slow between courses and it was sometimes a wait for a table. Breakfast on the other had in the Lido was superb friendly helpful staff and large selection of food. The formal evenings were very disappointing. The dress code seemed to allow for any attire except trainers and shorts. Shore excursions. Only one was taken from the ships official offer. This proved to be on Grand Cayman where a bus excursion resulted in a 30 minute ride followed by a visit to a shell house outside only a rum distillery gift shop only and a visit to a location call Hell where the gift shop included a post office to allow you to post your cards from Hell. All further excursions were taken from private tour operators found after disembarking and were found to be great value for money and the reliable. The on board team for shore excursions were either lacking knowledge or not prepared to assist when questioned about the sites to visit on your own. The cruise was 2 one week cruises put together. Half Moon Cay was visited twice and the middle Sunday morning was spent leaving the ship as you have to clear customs before getting back on board. A good 130 wasted. Islands visited were Grand Cayman Cozumel should have been but the ship could not dock due to high winds. Key West Grand Turk San Juan in Porto Rico St Thomas and finally a return to Half Moon Cay. Flights were on BA aircraft a 747 out and an A380 both took off and arrived on timeFod provided was mixed but the room on the A380 was very disappointing. On checking the statement on arrival home it was discovered that a charge of 2500 had been added to our on board account. I emailed Guest relations advising them and received a do not reply email by return. After 3 weeks with no reply I spoke to Seattle who promptly sent my email to Guest relations again no response. I emailed the CEO who is PA rang me to advise yes he have made an error and the money will be refunded in 7 10 days After 14 days with no money received I emailed her direct to be told sorry we are busy and it will be a further 14 days So far no money has been received.

I loved the fresh squeezed orange juice and the pancakes. The internet worked perfect in the room as well in the reception. The beds were very comfortable and cleaning service was every day. The pool was excellent and the area around very clean. The AC works perfect. The hotel is very well located close to Biscayne Bay Park Bayside Marketplace and Metromover which is free. There is a big supermarket close by and across the street there are 2 fast food restaurants. Overall experience was very pleasant and we definitely recommend this hotel.

The location is prime and this is obvious due to the constant influx of people. there is quite a bit of folks at the bar which is surprising though it is not a packed Miami scene. I was within walking distance of outstanding areas so if you are willing you can definitely do it. Overall I was highly satisfied. I do not have much to say because there is not much to say.

To me it represents a higher standard the the average hotel. If I ignore the fact that the lobby is a few floors up from the street and there is no one greeting you at the door. The looks and feel was not really good. However the Lobby looks nice on the surface but if you start to look into the details then you start to notice there is alot of small tear and wear. When we arrived we got told we could not get the rooms we had checked into from the web. And we had to wait for 4 hours. After 4 hours we still could not get into the rooms because they were not cleaned yet. After some going back and forth we had to accept what we got. The elevators. oh the elevators. They must be really old. In one of the elevators you could see into to the shaft. There is some holes down in the corners. The certificate in one should have been renewed a few months ago. We were wondering if the buttons are working correctly as you could push and push before something happened. The walls in the corridors are not straight the look like some downhill slalom course. Doors are scratched and the pipes to the sink had leaked some time but never got cleaned. However the cleaning were actually other then that pretty good. The closet looks like it were fr some horror movie and I am pretty sure you could just rip the safe with you. The bed was really comfy and alot of the others from my party liked the pillows. They were good but not really what I personally like. Not sure if there also is some issues with the fan in the bathroom because it took some time to get the moist away after you took a shower. I really liked the shower. Good pressure and heat. Also a issue we ran into was that you could hear you neighbour or when pl walked in the hallway. One of the rooms we had were just next to the elevators and they could hear that ding noise it does on ever floor. The breakfast was also really good. Most of the staff were real nice. Never had dinner in the Bride restaurant but we did have a bite in 1602. Not really a good experience with staff or food drinks. The water and sodas were stinking of chlorine and tasting it. It felt like the water is straight from the pool. They screwed up the orders and one time we had to wait an hour for ice cream. It gets real loud and there is not alot of seating if you are more then 4 people. The pool area were lacking some love but the few times I were there it felt ok. Alot of the chairs needs to be replaced but hopefully it is in the works. I understand they have done some renovations so it might be on the list. The area around the hotel is very strange. You have some real nice buildings and then you have a Ferari store. Around the corner you have homeless people and it feels really unsafe at times. It was my first time in Miami so it could just be me not used to this. I would not recommend anyone to go there and stay a week like we did. A night or two I guess is ok. That tram is real close and some buses. So t was pretty easy to get around even if you did not want to drive or take a taxi. So if Hilton could manage to fix alot of the details I would easily say it is a 4. But comparing it to the Hilton in Dubai down at the beach or the Hilton in Stockholm.

But no because the next day it happened again we were in front of the mirror getting ready and i was helping my sister put on her bathing suit top and someone came in the room AGAIN without knocking so we slammed the door and told them stop coming in without knocking first. Now my sister could have been naked or my brother or even me invasion of privacy do not you think. I was super angry because i told my family that the reason we stood at the hilton was because i have always had a phenomenal experience but this was insane. Now here was ANOTHER THING that really pissed us off their latin vibes Friday event when we get there they did not play latin music and advised us that they are not because their were more Americans White folks. then latinos blacks there.

It is large and anonymous with long gloomy Kafkaesque corridors leading to the rooms. But the rooms themselves are bright generously sized and the staff helpful and friendly. The breakfasts are generous busy and sensibly priced but dinners in the same restaurant are gloomy ill attended affairs with a poor dog eared menu staffed by only one waiter. It has a lovely pool but no changing room and no pool attendant most days that we were there. so if you want a beer or a club sandwich you have to put on your shirt and walk back into the hotel.
