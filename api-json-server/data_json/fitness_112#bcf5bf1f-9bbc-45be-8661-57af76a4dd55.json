The positives Room is large Good views from floor 18 and above good size pool and spa pool excellent gym lots of choices for food and drink better than expected conciege lounge good natural products for hair and body but no sewing repair. shoe shine or ear buds and cotton like all the other hotels we stayed. Amazing location in the heart of everything free fruit in the gym and free fruit seems to be a good signature benefit of this hotel negatives. Inconsistent policy with the use of the sauna. Having paid over \u00a3 300 per night we were allowed to use the sauna twice but not the third time because different staff were unclear about the rules for elite vs platinum customers. The sauna was on anyway and most hotels offer these to any guest paying for special rooms or services for me it just created bad will. Too many small children under 7 in the spa pool. I would have thought it was dangerous for them its certainly not allowed anywhere in Europe. however they were allowed as long as they were with their parents. Sounds like a law suit risk to me. Very large impersonal hotel. I think hotels of these types are going to be things of the past eventually. Smaller boutique hotels are the way of the future. Bigger is not better. We were disturbed quite a few times before check out because cleaning was not informed that we had booked a late check out typical problems I suspect of large impersonal hotels. Cleaner was not very thorough and left dirty towels in the bath twice indicating that she. he never cleaned it we did get new towels though. Cleaning around the pool area seemed distinctly lacking. Loads of dirty towels around. Being the most expensive hotel we stayed in we certainly were not wowed. in fact positively underwhelmed. We have both now decided any future stays anywhere will be smaller boutique chain or individual attention chains like the Acor Group.", "offset": [788, 922], "date": "2015-01-02", "cpt": "0", "category": "fitness"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "182fc866-b368-42c6-96a2-183eec3b0935", "sentence": "Exceptional.

The front desk was very helpful and moved us to the 25 floor. What a difference it makes to be in a high floor. Water seems to be flowing more and sheets seem to be better. The exercise room is like a normal gym. It is a very huge place with full weights and exercise machine. I wish there was a pool for the kids to swim in. The location is great. There is a target and Metron across the street and shopping in union square. We rented a car and I parked on the street basically for free during the memorial holiday.

We heard absolutely no street noise so sleeping was very good. The room had a bar area and a sitting area. The bar area had a coffee maker that was really appreciated but it would have been nice to have a mirror in that area then 2 adults could get ready simultaneously.

My stay at this hotel was really really really mixed. As I travelled for business and pleasure I need to evaluate this hotel from both perspectives. I my opinion this hotel is really better suited for the business traveler. Let me explain why with pros and cons. Pros. the rooms are fine. They are updated for the most part. The actual shower is old with the generic white 3x3 white tiles but there is the added grab bar and circular shower curtail. The bed is comfortable. The WiFi works well. The convention facilities are HUGE. Tons of space for large conventions there were 2 large conventions going on when I was there. Convention facilities are great and the staff attentive. The gym is quite large and with top equipment. The food in the restaurant is good. Staff for the most part is nice. Cons. The hotel is SUPER crowded. This is big downside in my mind for the regular holiday traveler. It is so crowded that the valet even has a TV monitor for people to see when their vehicle is ready. The food options are minimal but then again you are in the middle of city so no big deal. On top of the hotel is The View a beautiful bar with a great view of the city. Unfortunately since there are so many conventions going on at this hotel a lot of the times half the bar is closed for private parties and when the bar is not closed off for private parties it is so crowded that it is noisy and difficult to get a seat. Some staff may not be so nice since there are so many people they need to take care of they feel overwhelmed. Overall I really think this hotel is for the business traveler. It has all you want for the business traveler. If you like a busy hotel then this is hotel is for you. However for regular tourists a smaller less business oriented hotel is better in my opinion.", "offset": [695, 741], "date": "2017-07-22", "cpt": "1", "category": "fitness"}, {"id": 16, "uid": "2a03a7aa-8d26-4f26-8bd1-c2911d0f24dc", "sentence": "Perfect 3night stay with family.
