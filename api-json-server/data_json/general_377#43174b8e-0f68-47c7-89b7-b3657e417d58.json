There are also a few options for dining and they have a Starbucks and places to do a little shopping. There is a walkway over to the beach and they offer guests free chairs towels and umbrellas to take there. For a fee they will deliver to the beach and bring back.

From the moment you walk into this amazing property to the time you leave you feel taken care of. A grand entry room and doorman greets you as well as hospitable staff all the way from valet to manager. The rooms are well appointed with comfortable beds nicely lit bathrooms a large closet a fridge a small sitting chair a desk with two chairs and a good size balcony with two outside chairs and a table. You have the option to be located in three areas if available one is a large area in the center of the property overlooking the main pool and the beach another in a quieter fish pond and spa area without a beach view but with the sound of trickling water several other areas are located on either end of the property. one overlooking a long vertical fountain with a beach view and nearer to restaurants one overlooking the private jacuzis and one overlooking the kids slide pool. Most rooms have beach views either from the side or directly from the rooms overlooking the beach which are also closest to the roadThis location offers incredible options for dinning from casual gluten free. pizza in one on site establishment to fine dinning in several others. The site also offers a main small store for pool snacks drinks gifts pastries expreso etc. There are several clothing stores and a great place to rent bikes surf boards etc. Check out the pictures because you will see this is a newer property with Spanish tiles and a slightly charming adobe feel for such a large property. Such excellent architecture for what could have been otherwise just an average large hotel site. The interior feels lush with lovely fabrics and warm colors unlike other hotels with can be overly cold and modern in design which we do not prefer. I also appreciate that there are only four floors which creates a more welcoming less urban atmosphere. Room service is good and portions are larger more tasty and less expensive than most room service prices which I appreciated. The pool is divine you can lounge all day and order food and cocktails right from your pool chair. Unlike most polls this pool is designed with round edges with a slightly diagonal curve so it just feels less urban and more unique. They play pretty good upbeat music and offer fun things like kid surf lessons in the pool and smores at night. They have a movie night as well. I find this hotel to be family friendly without the craziness. In other words kids are having fun here but are well mannered and do not take over the experience. We stayed here instead of the craziness of Anaheim. The Hyat offers a shuttle to Disneyland which is very convenient. Also if you leave after 1030 it is only 40 min to Universal Studios which is open until 10. This location is a great way to get away from the madness of Anaheim while still being able to go to Disneyland. Our child even opted to stay on the property rather than go an extra day to Disneyland if that tells you how lovely it is. Hyat has built a bridge over highway one small 2 3 land road that is right next to the hotel. so you can walk across to the beach. it is a famous surfing and boogie board beach and also offers a jogging waking area right next to the sand. Huntington Beach allow fires on the beach at night so that is either fun to do or to watch those glowing lights at night from your balcony. The Hyat provides beach chairs and umbrellas so you can enjoy yourselves at the beach without the hassle. Their spa looks amazing as well as the 3 of 4 small outdoor jacuzi areas although we did not have time to enjoy. there is also a small couch nook with fireplace for reading and a fully outfitted very impressive gym with all the machines you had need. So well done so many options on one property. Downsides. A bit expensive for the room size but when you take in what is available on the entire property it is worth it. If they raise their prices though I might look elsewhere. 450 575 a night is steep along with added daily valet costs resort fee and taxes. I would have appreciated one more shuttle option to Disneyland as it leaves very early and returns late. Perhaps a way to purchase Disney tickets at the hotel with perks. What was amazing. Most everything. But a place is not lovely just because of what it offers but because of the people. At one point during our four night stay we realized we should have counted how many smiles and positive greetings we received from almost every staff member. Honestly it was the people here who will bring us back as well. We had a slight issue with our final bill and Roxane at the front counter could not have been more helpful straightening things up and making sure we were taken care of. Even with a confirmation phone call later the day after we left.

This review is really written for any British tourists going to the Huntington Beach. I booked it through British Airways and had typed in Los Angeles as my preferred location and this is the hotel they offered. I checked online and it looked fantastic and the reviews were great so without checking the location I accepted. This showed my naivety of the geography of LA and the size of the surrounding area. It took quite a while to get to the hotel from the airport and that should have been a clue as well. However as per the reviews the hotel is fantastic. The rooms are huge the landscaped grounds and pools are beautiful and as the name suggests it is right next to the beach. There is wifi in the rooms and the hotel provides towels for the pool and beach. There are two restaurants in the hotel and the food is very good. We were there for four nights and had booked tickets for Universal Studios. So on the first morning we asked the concierge how we could get there. His first question was do you have a car. Now I have seen the driving and congestion in LA so this was not an option. He also did not suggest it has we would have to use 4 freeways and I estimated would probably take about 2 hours. He then checked taxi costs and it would have cost over 300 so we ended up giving him the tickets and then had to book tickets for Disneyland so we lost about \u00a3 300. In addition whilst the Huntington is a great hotel it sits on its own. There are no shops or restaurants nearby so we ended up eating in the hotel every night. Therefore this review is more about my stupidity and BA offering me a hotel in Orange County when I asked for LA. If you want a lovely relaxing hotel then this is for you.

We have stayed at various locations on the PCH over the years and last week was our first visit to the Hyat in HB. My wife teenage daughter and myself had a fantastic time. Our first day was surf lessons with Johnny from Toes on the Noes. It was a super experience for my daughter as she immediately learned to zip around on the waves and had some good laughs with him over my inability to catch a wave. but hey at least I tried and have convinced myself to get in shape. We rented bikes from that facility the next day and rode miles and miles on the nearby trials. Next day was an early morning visit to the spa for my wife she loved it and now has her game face to come back to snowy Montana to finish up her school year. Final day was a pool day enjoying the well kept pool area and having some fun snacks delivered by a very friendly staff. For me I enjoyed all of the pools hot tubs along with just sitting on our awesome deck having a beverage. Super friendly staff and very clean facility. I have read mostly outstanding reviews on this facility and agree completely. I am a bit bewildered with the periodic negative comment and am curious if those folks were at the same place perhaps they are just the type that are not happy with anything.

There are hundreds of people at the pool with nowhere to sit and it simply just feels like a public place. nothing special or crisp at all about it.

My two teenage twins and I stayed here for 2 days in August and we look forward to a return trip. Unfortunately one son was sick one of the days which meant we could not take full advantage of some of the activities such as surfing lessons using the exercise room and having smores at the beach firepits. A huge shout out to Luke Stelmach Ast. Guest Experience Manager at Hyat for contacting us prior to our arrival to see if we were celebrating a special occasion. In fact the twins were turning 15 yrs. old. He personally came to our hotel room to deliver a thoughtful handwritten card and birthday vouchers which the boys redeemed for food and a Smash ball game. Perfect gifts for teenage boys. It was a small gesture but really appreciated and made the boys feel special. Kudos to Mr Stelmach for also honoring my room request high floor quiet location since I am a super light sleeper. The room was wonderful. You could tell they were recently remodeled with nice decor roomy bathroom really nice mini refrigerator gigantic TV Keurig coffee maker which we used to make hot tea for my sick son and sensor lights on the foot of the bed. These lights were wonderful to see at night without having to turn on a light especially with a sick child. We also had a nice balcony with a view of the pool and ocean. The location across from the ocean was fabulous. The bridge over PCH with complimentary chairs umbrella and beach towels made for a wonderful day at the beach. We also rented the beach bikes and had a scenic 2 hr ride along the paved beach path. Access to the Regency Club was golden for us especially with a sick kid who stayed in bed for most of the first day. We could eat quickly and for a light eater like myself. both breakfast and evening appetizers were very satisfying.

Our family of four stayed at the resort in October during a conference I was attending and was a simple 25 minute cab ride from John Wayne airport. We had a Huntington Suite which was very spacious with a king sized bed as well as a pull out bed in the couch for the kids and one large bathroom including shower and separate tub. The suite was on the main level which was convenient with not having to use elevators and very quiet even though we were close to the grotto hot tub area. The room was cleaned well everyday however we did learn if you want the bath robes replaced each day you must call housekeeping and request them. We used the Sliders kids area pool and water slides and our 4 year old and 10 year old loved them although the slides are not very long. The only issue we had with the pool area was that when we went there on Sunday morning about an hour after it opened we found it to be a total mess. Nothing had been cleaned from the night before so there was food beer bottles and used towels everywhere. For dinner one evening and two mornings for breakfast we went to Watertable. The food was excellent and unique however not inexpensive as you can expect for a high end resort. We traveled to Disneyland one day and used Uber to get there which worked great. We were picked up within 5 minutes and it took about 35 minutes to get there early on a Friday morning. Not renting a car worked fine for us and helped avoid paying the high valet charges. The Surf City Grocers provided an easy place to get coffee and a quick breakfast while heading out even at 6 am. All staff that we encountered at the resort were helpful and friendly. The conference facilities were great even with a group of over 60 people there. The resort is huge and takes some time to get to know your way around but it was a fun adventure while we waited for our room to be cleaned upon arrival. Speaking of that even though we used the ap to notify them we would arrive at 3 pm the room was not ready til after 4 pm but it gave us time to look around anyway. The beach is easily accessible over the walk way and they even had beach chairs still available to borrow for free during the air show when it was extremely busy.

NORM HUTTON hotel manager was unprofessional. Our stay was quite interesting considering my daughter found drugs in our room our first night. As I was getting my daughter ready for bed my daughter found two blue tubes on the sofa bed that seemed to be ear plug containers. Clearly the maids did n\u2019t check the sofa bed to see if the sheets have been used or else they would \u2019ve seen them. But upon inspecting them I found two marijuana joints. I was first furious because if I was n\u2019t right there who knows what would \u2019ve happened with my 9 year old daughter and these drugs especially if they had traces of Fentanyl. So I informed the front office but since it was late at night they said the GM will contact me the next morning. The next day the guest relations manager contacted me and was apologetic and offered to refund me one free night of my 3 night stay. I \u2019m thinking 1 free night after my daughter found drugs in the room. Are you kidding. Long story short the GM finally contacted me and said we will give you 600 points which is equivalent to a 3 night stay and after negotiating with the guest manager I was able to get a 200 credit at the restaurants. The problem then began upon checkout when I encountered the assistant director of rooms Norm Hutton when I was trying to get the 20 day room upgrade charge either waived or added to my daily rate since I was there on business and would n\u2019t get reimbursed for that charge if it was a separate line item. Norm immediately became defensive and his tone aggressive and said \u201c you \u2019re more than welcome to complain at the security office and I will just take away all the points and incidental credits we gave you \u201d. This all took place in the front desk in front of my family and other guests. I felt embarrassed and put off since he was threatening to take away all that was promised to me already by the GM if I was n\u2019t satisfied paying the 20 day upgrade charge. Apparently their computer system ca n\u2019t just add it to the daily rate and the upgrade charge has to be a separate line item charge. I \u2019m not a hotel manager but common sense would say that these guests have been through a lot already and waiving 20 day upgrade charge would be a no brainer. Not for Norm Hutton though he stood his ground continuing to be rude and unprofessional with me and my family and left me with no option but to be completely unsatisfied with my experience.
