Nice location near airport and Cascade Center for dining and shopping. Great speedy on demand shuttle service to Cascade Center and airport. My biggest complaint is this property is in dire need of renovations. We learned this is under way. I had huge issues with the noise. The doors of the rooms slammed every time and were heard throughout the entire hallway. The insulation is so bad I can hear the entire conversation of the folks in the hallway or on either side of my room. Miserable. The hotel provided ear plugs I am assuming because is overlooking runway. I used them for the hotel noise not the airport. The only saving grace was the hotel management and staff. The second week they put me on the 5th floor. This was much quieter but still not optimal. I appreciated the response from the staff and management to my issues.

There were 2 drawers available under the TV on the TV stand. However those drawers were only about 3 \u201d tall and did n\u2019t hold much. The bed took up most of the room giving it a cramped feel. There was no refrigerator but one was available for rent no microwave just a coffee maker next to the TV. The location of the hotel is next to the airport.

The hotel itself is very good. ProsIt is in a convenient airport location They are updating. It appears cleanBut they had some major consThe construction is not complete and potentially dangerous. There was a pipe cover on the floor upon walking in to the room. The housekeeping staff actually walked in the room with me as he was dropping off a trundle bed. He just shrugged and said oh. He did not pick it up or offer maintenance. This is not a deal breaker as the room is otherwise clean but that is one star off. The hot and cold water is backwards at the sink. When I brought this up to the front desk they did offer to have maintenance come up but we checked in late and my son was already asleep. They offered no warm apologies or comps or anything at all. The hotel should count their blessings that someone without integrity has not stayed in that room and sued for that safety concern. I can attach a video proving this if needed. Another star off. Popcorn ceiling is different colors. Usually for me this is not a deal breaker as long as it does not look dangerous. But with all the other maintenance problems it makes me worry why it is discolored. 12 star off. The staff is without any notion of friendliness or initiative. They were not overtly rude but they definitely were NOT amiable. This should be 12 stars off. I am very disappointed.

So we arrived Thursday evening and upon entering the hotel you can tell that it has been renovated. The lobby was beautiful and the check in was painless. I was acknowledged as an SPG member and given an upgraded room and offered a late check out. Room was beautiful and very modern. A few downsides were the pillows were all way too soft and almost nonexistent. Even putting three tougher did not make one nice one. We had a room that faced the runway. If your a light sleeper this may be an issue but after a certain time the planes do not fly but this was not a problem for us. You do get a refrigerator and one free bottle of water a day. The bathroom was updated the only problem i saw was the door barely cleared the toilet. No issue with water pressure or getting hot water. HOUSEKEEPING. So Friday we left at 11 am and returned at 9 pm to find that our room had not been serviced. I called down to the front desk and requested that clean towels be sent up. After 30 mins I called again and was told someone would come up. After 1 hour I went down and requested a manager. I explained to him that our room was never serviced and that after an hour I was still waiting on towels and wanted to go to bed. He was really understanding and by the time I got back to my room he was calling to me the towels were in route which they were. As an apology I did receive under my door two vouchers for the bar restaurant area. Saturday we left again at 11 am and returned about 830pm to find our room had not only not been service but housekeeping came in and left fresh towels on the vanity in the bathroom and then left. Never made the beds never emptied the trash etc. I did not even have enough toilet paper to make it through a night. I immediately went downstairs and requested a manager and was directed to Melody. I explained how this was the second day and that I could overlook the first time but the fact that someone actually came into the room and left towels on the vanity and left did not bother to put them away nor clean the room was just astounding to me. She was great. She was very apologetic and offered me vouchers in addition to making sure the room was serviced immediately. Since I already had vouchers she did agree to give me some points to my account. Husband and I went to the bar while Melody oversaw our room being properly serviced. She came back downstairs and checked with me two different times to let me know that it was in process and then when it was done. I really appreciated the fact that she went up and verified it was all taken care. I would stay here again just for the hotel and the cleanness of it but i might request a room that is not at the end of the hall near the stairwell or make it a point to stop by the front desk on the way out to make sure my room was serviced. By the way the older gentlemen working the bar Saturday night i think his name was Jerry was great. Drinks were not watered down and he was great to talk with.

Honestly Portland Airport should have a bit more hotel options and this particular Sheraton is one of the hotels closest to the airport.

The room has indeed gone through major renovations with new designs. However I can not get over the fact that there is no more desk. It is just a coffee table with sofa chair in the corner. It is just WRONG. Then I have already spotted many wear and tear in the room. WIFI suffered issues in the late evening but things were back to normal in the morning. The service was okay and the agent checking me in was apologetic for all the recent changes to Starwod and Mariot. The new gold elite status means only a 2 pm late checkout instead of a guarantee 4 pm. The agent offered me a few amenities but I declined. I think I will stay at other airport hotels next time as this Sheraton is underwhelming. There is also nothing closed to the hotel. If you stay at the Aloft you will have a few eateries near the hotel. If you get a great rate it is okay to stay here but if you find a better rate at any other hotels you should stay at those other hotels. This Sheraton has past its prime. PS.
