The Radison Blu sounded promising a four star hotel at little more than half the price of the nearby five star hotels with a location that was almost as convenient to sights and the metro. Our room was modern immaculate and in excellent repair with a comfortable king size bed abundant closet space and an in room safe. The bathroom was well equipped with ample vanity space. Our sixth floor room was quiet with minimal traffic noise despite bring on the street side. The WiFi was fast and easy to use. Our rate included the breakfast buffet which was comprehensive and well staffed although some of the staff seemed inexperienced eg clearing plates prematurely. We were delighted that our room was available despite our arrival at 930 AM. Other guests might not be so fortunate but this was a huge plus for us. All of this would lead me to give the Radison an \u201c excellent \u201d rating but there were annoyances. A small one. unlike most competing hotels in Kyiv the Radison quotes rates without taxes which are only added in at checkout resulting in misleading comparison shopping. But the much more significant problem is that the lobby of the hotel is undergoing major renovation. The absence of a lobby was not the problem what seemed to be the breakfast area was pressed into service as a small reception space with boxes of supplies on the floor breakfast was instead served in the restaurant space. The issue was construction noise which started at 9 AM and was continuing when we returned from dinner at 830 PM on a Sunday. In addition a circuitous path through the construction zone was required to access the elevator see photos with two of three being inaccessible to guests. That the hotel was being renovated with construction extending into the evening hours clearly should have been disclosed on the hotel website.

Well it is said that a first impression is everything and this hotel does not disappoint. A sleek and smart reception lobby and very friendly and helpful reception staff.

Classy decoration design spotlessly clean and well stocked. The room had an iron ironing board safe stocked minibar shoe cleaning accessories slippers complimentary water and all the usual bathroom necessities. The room service menu is different to that in the main restaurant which is exclusively Italian. Restaurant service was quick and efficient and friendly. Food was really nice and complimented by bread and olives. The food was nicer than what I \u2019ve had in ItalyBreakfast has pretty much everything you \u2019d want with the exception of more basic cereals and a decent toaster. But this is nitpicking as the breakfast buffet is extensive and from what I had really nice. Staff were again full of smiles and very friendly and willing to help. The lady on the front desk who takes your room number is just full of cheer. A great way to start the day. The gym and spa area is nice. Gym well equipped for a hotel with separate male and female changing rooms with showers. The sauna and steam room is mixed sex. Both the sauna and steam room are large and outside are loungers and showers. Towels are provided. The gym spa is unmanned so you just help yourself to towels robes and slippers.

Number of people went to the reception to complain but the answer was we do not know what is happening. even if they were clearly responsible for the noise. Smiling and lying. Unbelievable.
