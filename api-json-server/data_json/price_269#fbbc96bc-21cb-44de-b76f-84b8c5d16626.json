Our objective at the end of a 7 week adventure in New Zealand was to find a place to just relax on the beach and chill out. Having looked at many possible options in Singapore we chose Langkawi first then the Four Seasons. Did we chose rightThe customer service starts when you make a booking. Not many hotels advise you that there is a better cheaper option to the one you have just booked. We were advised that staying 7 days instead of the 4 I just booked would mean we got 2 nights free. Then just before arriving we had a note from our personal customer relations representative seeking information in order to make sure our holiday was just perfect from the get goFirstly I would say this is not at cheap hotel. But in my view our stay was worth every penny spent and more. More importantly it met our expectations and much more. Having met and spoken to many of the staff one is struck by the fact that most of them live and have lived on Langkawi. They are local people who have been taught the skills of working in a top class hotel without loosing the essence that is the local culture. Their soft and gentle approach to everything is quite captivating leaving one with the feeling that everyone really cares that you have a good time. The FB was extensive and certainly exciting enough to accommodate the taste buds for a week or more. A nice touch was a visit from the FB manager to invite us to request any special dish and they would do their best to produce it. The wine list was resort wide and contained some good wines at reasonable prices. As whole the resort which is vast in size but has only 94 rooms needs you to take one of the free bicycles and set off on an adventure to see all its amazing features. Getting around is bikes or buggies that whisk you from place to place. I recomend just walking along the beach shoes off. This is not a formal resort with dress codes for the restaurants so you can pack light. I liked it so much I made a movie of it htpsvimeocom12179709. enjoyThis resort is attractive to all age groups and creates the perfect environment for your dream holiday no matter what it is.", "offset": [1505, 1586], "date": "2015-03-18 00:00:00", "cpt": "0", "category": "price"}, {"id": 3, "uid": "a61e28cb-04ae-46c9-b02e-5e3fb0f7dd89", "sentence": "Amazing but prices are pretty eye watering.

I have been very fortunate to stay in some of the world best hotels over 40 years of business and leisure travel but the Four Seasons is the best hotel I have had the pleasure of staying in. Why. Firstly the staff then the location facilities food service and did I mention the stafOn arrival we were met at reception and sat in comfort with a cool drink during the check in formalities. Luggage transported to the room as were we by buggy always available 24 hours if you did not want to walk. the grounds were beautiful and extensive even with fab monkeys birds and other wildlife. We stayed in an upper pavilion which I think is at the lower end of the price range but it was unbelievable spacious 2 sides open to the balcony with fantastic views of the grounds beach and sea. The bathroom was unbelievable with a fantastic large bath. loads of space for storage and free wifi. Facilities fantastic adult pool with individual swim up pools ice water and free fruit etc. Family did yoga but we did not use gym. Great business centre with free use of computers printers etc. Lovely spa though we did not use it. The food fantastic breakfast with everything you could want both western and Asian etc loads cooked fresh to order. 3 restaurants italian malaysian and grill. We were on half board and had the run of the menue no limited menue or supplements which made having the likes of lobster etc a real treat. Beach side setting. you can eat outside on the terrace or even a table on the beach. We were able to have a special family meal with individual menus selected by the staff based on what we had chosen during the week a really special evening. The location is a bit remote but everywhere in langkawi is 30 mins away and taxis inexpensive. More than 1k of private beach made us feel as if we were on our own tropical paradise. Finally the staff always keep the bst to last. They knew us personally by day 2 and their friendly but professional approach made the week. Special thanks to Anekhe and also to Kartik and Muthu. New hotel manager Andrew Harrison welcomed his guests individually and had a much appreciated cocktail party.

Its not often i feel compled to write a review however after stying here during July15 for 12 nights i feel its only right to share our experinces of what i can only discribe as the most amzing service levels we have ever encountered. We stayed in one of the beach front villas with private plunge pool and we opted for half board. this was an absolute winner on both counts. there are 3 main restaurants on the resort with a bit of a trek out if you want to experience local places \u2026. so worth adding in the half board option. The best place we found was down at the beach front restaurant which gave the most amzing views of the sunset whilst your feet are in the sand. food was excellent and the wine although expensive was godif you are looking for a place to relax enjoy your time with the family and be looked after from the moment you get up to the time your ready for bed \u2026. this is itwounderfuly attentive staff who make every effort to make sure you have what you need. special mention to Garam hotel experience manager who was fantastic.

I rate the resort as good as its above average. I would not however place the Resort at the same level as the Nam Hai in Hoi An Vietnam and Qualia on Hamilton Island. The Four Seasons Resort in Langkawi is in a beautiful location even after allowing for the cement factory that is a few kilometer \u2019s down the bay. The gardens are lovely and while the fitout of our room was beginning to show its age a bit it was still of a very high standard. The resort is spread out over a large area and is a very private place ideal for those who value their privacy and are seeking a bit of solitude peace and quiet. We booked a Lower Melaleuca Pavilion for two reasons 1. It had an outside shower and 2. it was the best price. The accommodation at the resort consists of Villas and Pavilions which are artfully spread throughout the resort. It would seem that only the Villas have full seas views while the Pavilions are split into two categories those with a partial sea view and those without. The Pavilions are built in blocks of four with two upstairs and two downstairs. Our pavilion had an interconnecting door which I hate but no internal noise came through although it was empty except for a couple of nights when it had a single guest. We found that the inter pavilion noise was non existent unles the people upstairs were making use of the outside verandah. Overall I felt that it lacked a certain \u201c Sharpness \u201d that I would have expected of a Resort managed by the Four Seasons Brand. The Good. It is a beautiful resort with well maintained tropical gardens spread out over several acres. The beach is beautiful. They have an excellent buggy service that will transport you around the resort. Our room was beautifully fitted out and the outside shower was a treat. The Resort I was given to understand had 90 odd rooms and I believe that the occupancy rate was around 60 and yet while moving around the resort it felt that we were the only ones there. It is also possible to obtain a bicycle to ride around the resort. The restaurants are excellent if not overpriced. AUD50 four 3 prawns is a bit over the top \u263a but I suppose we can expect that from a brand like the Four Seasons. I would also mention that the staff at the restaurants were also very good. The buffet breakfast was excellent and as good as the best we have ever had. While all the restaurants were uniformly of a high quality the Ikan Ikan was in our opinion the best with delicious food and a Malay menu. It is shut on Fridays which happened to be my wife \u2019s birthday which was a big disappointment to us however the hotel made us a small cake and sung happy birthday to her which was really nice. Without fail the staff were extremely courteous and very helpful and nothing was too much trouble. The pools were fantastic and the idea of having an Adult pool is excellent. I expected to have a daily hassle in obtaining a cabana this was not the case. The free WiFi is excellent in the rooms and in the restaurants however in the area of the adult pool and the Rhu Bar its abysmal. There is a paid wifi service if you are a heavy user but we found the free wifi to be great. For Later. Our room seemed to have a few small maintenance issues that should not have been. They should have been picked up as part of a maintenance schedule. If you are just a couple like us there are a quite a few young families at the resort which in itself is not a problem as the resort is spacious and there is an adult pool for those without children. This policy however does not seem to extend to the restaurants and the resort does not appear to have a policy with regard to very young children in restaurants in the evenings. On our last night just as we were about to order our coffee and gaze at the stars and the beach when a family with a young child under two was placed beside us in a near empty restaurant. we found out later that they had made this request. The child was obviously unhappy and proceeded to make the few dinners that were present aware of this fact. The same child had been in the restaurant over lunch behaving in a similar fashion. While many parents have the grace not to bring such a young child to dinner there are a few that do n\u2019t. It would be simple to have a child free area in a restaurant a child free restaurant or child free restaurant times. Simple renovations were being carried out to a Pavilion beside us on our last two days. On our last evening they were still dismantling scaffolding and loading a truck at 8 pm in the evening and had also been working outside when we were having pre dinner drinks on our verandah at around 5. I called and had it stopped. My issue is that we should have been notified that work would be carried out beside us and that if it interfered with our peace and quiet we could ask to be moved but this never happened. The duty manager I spoke to did not seem to get it explaining to me that the hotel had not been aware that they were working so late which is another story within itself. Food service in the Rhu bar and the Adult pool is very slow it took at least 45 minutes for a club sandwich to arrive at the adult pool and by then the fries were cool and soggy as was the sandwich we just about sent it back but were starving and did n\u2019t want to wait another 45 minutes. We had a similar experience at the Rhu Bar. The home web site advertises a very interesting Japanese menu for the Rhu bar but it was obviously out of date as the food menu at the Rhu bar is quite limited very tasty but a long way from being Japanese. If you are intending to visit the Resort I suggest that you do not rely on the Four Seasons web site for the restaurant menus. In all we had a very relaxing and enjoyable stay and I would recommend the resort to others with the proviso that it does lack a certain crispness or sharpness that I have experienced in similar luxury establishments. The Villas appear to be excellent and if like us you intent to stay in a pavilion I would pay the extra and choose a upper pavilion with a partial sea view. I also believe that the Resort would do well to provide a courtesy bus service around the Island as it would enhance the stay and I think encourage visitors to stay longer.", "offset": [19, 66], "date": "2015-12-02 00:00:00", "cpt": "0", "category": "price"}, {"id": 8, "uid": "61d6b128-7ea2-4857-a399-ad06809cf585", "sentence": "Staff excellent resort stunning.

Recently our family stayed in langkawi Four seasons resort hotel from 2nd to 7th June for 5nights. We stayed at the partial sea view king room. From airport to the resort was about 30mins. Hotel included pickup from the airport which was excellent. Upon reaching the Hotel the staffs was extremely friendly and give us a tour of the place using their buggy. The room was fantastic and huge it has a huge Jacuzi at the back yard too. TV had some problem with the receiver flickering all the time. But managed to solve the flickers after changing to a new receiver. Have to watch out for crickets a lot of them and very noisy at night. We had about 10 monkeys outside our room one afternoon which was a pleasant surprise. But please remember keep your room door close. We fed them all the fruits from our room. 1. Food review There were 3 restaurants that we have tried. I must say all the Staff services was excellent. a. The Kelapa grill near the family pool if you order the nasi goreng and fried kway teow it wo nt be wrong. We ask for additional chilli padi the noodles was excellent and tasty b. Ikan Ikan restaurant more traditional restaurant serving local malay cuisine. Our favorite was the egg fried rice and the Malay fried chicken which you do not want to miss c. International Serai restaurant that serve breakfast located near the hotel lobby. Breakfast spread was not bad but I wish selection was much more. As every morning was the same food after a while it get really boring. But dinner was excellent as well they serve me Mediterranean cuisine. We had the triple cheese pasta and fish while our kids had the usual pizzas. Overall the food in all the restaurants was very good and well prepared. But the price was extremely extremely expensive. A simple soup might cut you back around 20 to 30sgd. During the last night we even went out to Ochard Ria in cenang for seafood travelling by normal taxi was about 30mins and cost 15sgd one way. The food was normal nothing to shout about. It was catering more to tourist not to locals. They were selling live seafood. Price was a lot cheaper than Four seasons though 2. Beaches at the Hotel and sea sports. Pros The beaches are long exclusive and private. Cons The beaches was really dirty fill with shoes and bottles. Water was not clear and clean as we would prefer. Not for snorkeling. More cleaning of the beaches highly recommended Weather was unpredictable during June. it can rain or shine 2 to 3 times a day. Seasports was available most of the time. And the staffs in charge was very helpful and gave us alot good information. During the last few days one the staff Zul and lady was fishing at the rubber jetty. This gentlemen and the lady was very friendly helpful and taught my sons how to fish for the first time in their life. Even though it was not part of their duties or responsibilities. This was a wonderful experience for my sons. I hope the hotel could seriously think of incorporating this fishing activities as one of the experiences for all the hotel guests. Overall review. We need to highly comendate a young gentlemen working there Mr Suyash from India. I believe he is one of the manager the restaurants. His service is way beyond excellent. We usually meet him at the breakfast restaurant in the morning. When he found out my younger son was down with high fever. He immediately help to arrange the hotel medical assistance to our room. He was always extremely hardworking and willing to go beyond his duties for the guests. He should be rewarded for such dedication to his profession and his guests. Always willing to help guests in any way. His friendly and positive attitude is a good representation of Four Seasons hotel. I would not hesitate visit the resort that he is working in during my holidays.

Take Joane in reception who phoned to check all was OK as we unpacked. When I mentioned that our only slight concern was that we were nowhere near the adult pool she had us moved within the hour. Or the resort \u2019s own David Atenborough Aidi a brilliant naturalist passionately committed to conservation. He led our fascinating trip into the UNESCO mangroves site do n\u2019t miss this realised husband is a keen photographer so came round to us at breakfast next morning and gave him a superb CD of his own photos of the eagles monkeys hornbills and other wildlife he cares so deeply about. A real ambassador for the hotel and the UNESCO site. Or the very impressive Bernard Solomon Banqueting Manager. Talking to him on our last morning I happened to say how sad I was to find the superb Ikan Ikan Malaysian restaurant our favourite was closed that evening. No problem. He found us by the pool that morning brought us the extensive Ikan Ikan menu and arranged for his Malaysian chef to cook our chosen meals that evening and deliver them to us in one of the other restaurants. Service indeed. This hotel has the largest grounds and beach area on Langkawi with yet the smallest number of guest rooms. The gardens are just vast and beautifully planted. Wherever you are you \u2019l find privacy and space. Just spend time sitting at the stunning water area off reception breathtaking. Or wandering down the paths to the peaceful lotus pool. Our upper floor pavilion was just was enormous with a huge cathedral ceiling full length windows and balconies on two sides and wonderful views of exotic trees. The bed was just about the most comfortable ever the bath ridiculously big. Was it \u2018 run down \u2019 as a previous reviewer complained. Hardly. Certainly we \u2019ve stayed in flashier glitzier places with more \u2018 bling \u2019 and ultra modern styling. But the muted colours and furnishings here were far more to our taste. My one dislike was the lack of a solid glass door to the very big and efficient shower. curtains are not our favourite. And certainly some of the dark wood used so often was weathered but that \u2019s hardly surprising in this climate and doubtless will be renovated in its turn. The atmosphere here was always informal laid back relaxing. Quite a few kids around but the hotel sensibly tends to organise activities at separate ends of the resort. So the adults pool area at one end was the most peaceful place we have been to. Fantastic lap pool about 90 metres long plenty of sun beds with views out to sea and Abas and Adix thteam to man the bar bring you food try the delicious meze platerconstant water or occasional cocktail fruit ice cream. all with the inevitable smileBreakfast was as good and as varied as you would expect. All the usual plus delights like smashed avocado and poached egg on toast sparkling wine homemade Bircher muesli daily health \u2018 shots \u2019. Dinner at one of three different themed restaurants. Apart from Ikan Ikan we especially enjoyed The Kelapa Grill on the beach tasty fish and meats always well presented. Of course the hotel is not perfect. And our reservations are those that you will find in other TA reviews. Food and beverage prices are indeed exorbitantly high higher than we have paid in similar hotels. It was a comment made often by people we talked to and we know management are aware of these views. And yes at times on the beach you ca n\u2019t help but look over the bay to the distant cement factory eerie at dusk as the smoke rises next to the setting sun. And occasionally just very occasionally that superb service did falter. But the way a problem was dealt with is exactly why we will hope to go back here again Bernard Solomon had come to talk to us that last morning as unusually we \u2019d had a problem with very slow service the previous evening. human error. Not only did he try to make amends by organising the fantastic Ikan Ikan meal for us that final evening but when we had finished insisted we did not pay for it to make up for their previous error. Now that is superb serviceAnd it \u2019s just that type of approach that will definitely bring us back. Great hotel fantastic staff.

I must have lost count of the number of guests who on walking up to and looking across the crystal clear waters of the Infinity Adult Quiet Pool towards the Andaman Sea beyond the golden sands of Thulang Rhu Beach simply exclaimed one word. wowWith only 91 rooms dotted along the edge of the one mile long Tanjung Rhu Beach with acres of manicured gardens one never feels particularly crowded in this resort. The basic rooms are the Pavilion rooms. In blocks of 4. Odd numbers 0103 are ground floor rooms even numbers 0204 are upstairs rooms. Built some 13 years ago in a traditional Malay design these unfortunately as commented upon by other reviewers are starting to show their age and looking a little tired. Upstairs rooms have a balcony and an indoor bath Jacuzi. Whilst ground floor rooms have a terrace opening directly onto the gardens as well as an outdoor shower bath. I had hazard a guess that once the wow effect has worn off the outdoor bath shower see little if any useBe prepared that if you sleep on the right of the double bed your iphone electrical leads will not reach to the bed and you will also have to jump out of bed to switch off the bedside light. Heavy slightly faded and ill fitting curtains along with aging sliding doors with significant gaps all add to the tired appearance of these rooms that are simply in need of a little tarting upThe Beach side villas appeared to be in better cosmetic order and we noticed some had private plunge pools. But be prepared to pay a significant premium to have your direct beach access and that real Robinson Crusoe feel. The resort has 2 pools a family pool near to the Watersports Centre and Kids Club. If you want this specify a low numbered villa or Pavilion. If you want to be near the Adult Quiet Pool you will need to specify a Pavilion room in Blocks 13 17 or one of the higher numbered beach villas. Food options are the Kelapa Grill Malaysian and International Ikan Ikan Malaysian and the Serai International Italian which also doubles as the breakfast restaurant. Breakfast is varied and plentiful and caters for all tastes. I never had the same breakfast twice in 14 days. The restaurants are sort of in the middle of the resort along with the Rhu Bar for your evening sundowner. If pushed we would state that Ikan Ikan was our favourite restaurant. But be prepared for a hefty bill in all the restaurants. We found that on average a 2course meal you will be full believe me with wine will cost \u00a3 250 for a family of 4. Beware also the bottled water at \u00a3 9 a go and ask to drink the free iced water insteadThere are very few options nearby but a taxi ride would find food much cheaper even with the added cost of the taxi fare. As usual polside food was somewhat expensive a coke \u00a3 450 a beer \u00a3 630 Caesar salad with chicken \u00a3 17 Wagyu Burger \u00a3 23 and Pizza \u00a3 1350. But sadly these are the sort of prices I have come to expect when staying at 5 Star Resort Hotels where there is a premium on the stay. The Gym was well equipped and frequented by us on a daily basis. We did not have any Spa treatments but the reports I heard were all very good. Table Tennis Petanque Pool and Tennis all available along with the use of free bikes to get around the resort. However beware of the reverse breaking system on some of them it takes a little getting used toIf you do not fancy riding or walking which at night can be a little hazardous as the resort is quite dimly lit there are plentiful buggies waiting to whisk you anywhere in the resort. Mangrove safaris water sports archery and rock climbing are all provided for a small price. Indeed you choose if you want activity or simply want to take in the splendour of it all. However the best bit of the resort without doubt are the staff who are all truly wonderful and try to do everything in their power to make your stay special from Nizam the pool attendant I hope your wedding was magical to Melissa Tang The General Manager they all genuinely want your stay to be as perfect as possible. Indeed from the airport pick up to departure we found everything was very smooth and refined. The Four Seasons Ap is brilliant. The chat system means that all restaurant bookings and requests can be made from the polside sun lounger. The communication was simply excellent. I truly came away from this hotel believing that nothing was too much trouble. So where was I happiest simply with my arms over the end of the infinity pool weightless in the cool water staring out to the glistening Andaman Sea and the limestone outcrops simply taking it all in we will be back.", "offset": [2538, 2745], "date": "2018-04-19", "cpt": "1", "category": "price"}, {"id": 17, "uid": "3d05a9a8-bd91-4e59-b27a-2f967ab188d4", "sentence": "A few improvements could make a stay here truly wonderful. The location and accommodation are brilliant and the welcome very warm. We had a 2 bedroom family villa right on the beach with a stunning outlook which was extremely spacious and well fitted out. The complimentary wi fi worked consistently well. Staff are very helpful and keen to provide good service but there are some gaps that could be filled to ensure that they can do so. For example rooms may be serviced randomly anytime between 8 am and 4 pm. so maybe it would be a nice idea to ask guests for a general preference on check in which would help both staff and guests to know what to expect and plan their days. It sounds so churlish and first world problem to complain but very late servicing of our room I am writing this at 145pm and our room has not yet been serviced with no set up of towels and beach lounges left us feeling a little underwhelmed given the cost of the experience. Also unfortunately the food is pretty average for such an expensive getaway. Again staff really want you to enjoy the offerings and try hard to get to know your preferences but with the best will in the world the dining experiences are disappointing from breakfast to dinner at the Kelapa Grill. Our spa and gym experiences were great and this really is a lovely resort. There is a new manager on board and I am certain he will be planning just the enhancements needed to lift the Four Seasons Langkawi to great heights. Despite minor complaints we would definitely come again.", "offset": [954, 1030], "date": "2018-07-22", "cpt": "1", "category": "price"}, {"id": 18, "uid": "5436ec40-a91f-495b-916d-3bb129e93828", "sentence": "Ultimate getaway. Simply put I do n\u2019t think we could have chosen a better place for our luxury beach holiday. The hotel is excellent the staff are genuinely friendly and helpful service impeccable and the attention to detail is impressive. Stayed in a beach villa which was luxurious the beach is amazing and ideal for lots of water sports and swimming and there are two beautiful pools as well. The hotel is spread out but you can choose a buggy service or they loan out bicycles to help you get around which was fun. The spa treatments were world class. There are three hotel restaurants to choose from which was good but a little pricey. Cocktails are about a tenner and dinner cost about \u00a3 50p. However you are spoiled for choice with breakfast with a fantastic selection. I recommend the waffles. We opted to go to Cenang beach in the evening. It \u2019s a lively tourist spot with lots of places to eat and you can walk on the beach after with people doing shows foot massages by the sea live music etc. We used Grab cabs to get around which was very reasonable and reliable. The hotel is pricey but going out of school holidays meant we had the beach mainly to ourselves or felt like it. and the rates are cheaper. However it was totally worth the spend and now we ca n\u2019t wait to go again. There \u2019s quite a bit of wildlife to see. Mangrove tour was excellent thanks Aidi and we had the occasional monkey by our window which added a bit of fun. Congratulations to Inderan the manager and his entire team for this world class team that gave us a holiday to remember.", "offset": [556, 640], "date": "2018-10-02", "cpt": "1", "category": "price"}, {"id": 19, "uid": "c10e2951-2989-45f7-9109-a1bdf2102d81", "sentence": "Disapointment. Hi We came to this hotel almost end of 2019 to have rest after our road trip in Taiwan. My husband made a surprise for me in a 6 star hotel in an amazing island. We arrived to the hotel on Sunday afternoon and we were exhausted. The staff was very helpful and kind. Day after on the Monday noon we could not wake up in the morning came to the adult pool to continue our rest and read a book after having small breakfast. Unfortunately there was no available deck. The pool area has not enough area and we have been told that we can search a place nearby the family pool. Actually we do n\u2019t like pool idea if there is a great beach and beach decks are only in front of the family pool. at least I saw only those Pool was of course full with the families with children. Due to the new year a lot of family stay at the hotel which is absolutely understandable. So we lied down on the beach. Today first day of the year we woke up again late around 11 am. We did not have breakfast and wanted to have some snacks at the restaurant and lie down again on the beach. But the surprise. No place. No place. Almost 1 mile Long Beach and no place. Yes. As you can see on the photos Four Season Hotel let only 20 decks on a giant beach. The staff is very helpful and solution oriented but the problem is lack of decks. Unbelievable. So the meaning that I got from this we must wake up at 7 am and have stress to find a deck on the beach as if we stay in a military camp. I do not even want to mention about the cost of staying here. Shame on four seasons.", "offset": [1474, 1535], "date": "2019-12-31", "cpt": "1", "category": "price"}]}
