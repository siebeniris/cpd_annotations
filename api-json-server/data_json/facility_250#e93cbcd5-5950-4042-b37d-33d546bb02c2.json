I was unfortunately here on business so did not get to enjoy many of the amenities but this was a first class hotel with first class service. Easy walking to a bunch of restaurants and shops. Thoroughly enjoyed again. 2nd stay here in the last 2 months. For you business travelers the internet is slow. Free service was 05MBps and I paid one night and unfortunately it was only 1MBPs. so not worth the upgrade.

We just stayed 5 days and I still did not want to leave. My family did the snow actives I pretty much stayed in the gym and spa when I was not shopping. I do have to say this is the first time the family was not up at the crack of dawn to ski and I think that is because the beds are so comfortable. All the ski equipment is handled for you no lugging skis around. And the personnel offers to help with the kids equipment big help.

I really do not like to give bad reviews. We try to look for positives. But this hotel missed a chance to turn a negative into a positive. Everything was great to start with. Even the very mediocre and over priced breakfast was tolerable. I am sorry but 4 for one egg and 7 for 2 slices of toast. They should be life changing. Instead it was institutional food at best. I would not have written a review to complain about the food. What really ruined the experience was the housekeeping staff moved my flat iron. It was on the bathroom counter with all my toiletries so I knew where it was. They put it under the counter with the hotels hair dryer. When I packed up I did not realize it was gone. I got 3 hours away from the hotel and it dawned on me that I did not remember packing it. I called the hotel and they found it. First they wanted to know if I was coming back for it. I had already told them I was 3 hours away. Then they said they would send it and wanted to know if I wanted the credit card on file to be charged. If they had not moved my personal property it would not have been left. But they are charging me to send it back. Terrible customer service. Not what I would expect from this hotel. There are a lot of choices in Vail. Next time I will make a different one. Oh and since I am ranting the valet that brought our car to us when we were leaving befouled it so badly we had to drive with the windows down for 30 minutes.", "offset": [545, 622], "date": "2015-06-03", "cpt": "0", "category": "facility"}, {"id": 7, "uid": "ef340390-d73f-46e2-bf6c-d9dba504301f", "sentence": "We had a buy one night get one free so took advantage. The hotel entrance faces north so GPS will not guide you to the front door. Great location at Vail Village. If you request a village view be prepared to look at the condo building right next door not the village. Mountain view gives you a view over the pool and towards the slopes. Restaurant breakfast service was very slow first morning much better the second one. Fireplaces and balconies in most rooms nice bathroom with marble granite soaking tub. Covered underground parking. For the price I recommend the Vail Cascade Spa as you can get right next to the creek and mountain for a better price. However it is a walk to Lions head and the village beyond but it is on the path that goes right by the creek. Bring your bikes for any summer stay in Vail.

We like everything in the hotel the rooms the facilities no question about that at alBut the responsiveness of the security front desk management is a joke. They did not allow us to check out at 1 pm instead of noon and we had to prepare our luggage early in the morning for check out because we wanted to ski until noon. When we came back we found our stuff on the dirty floor not on a cart or stored nicely in a room outside on the side of the hotel. My brand new purse was squeezed between a rock wall and one of the bigger bags with marks from the wall and also the color of the corners was visibly scratched. The security came and made pictures and we were assured that they will contact us. After a month no one called. I called they initially told me that there was no case filed but later found it. After few calls back and forth the last one was a message Rodney telling me that there is no decision yet on my case. What decision.

The workout facility something important to me wherever I stay was very good and offered a wide variety of machines cardio and resistence and free weights. My only complaints were the location of my rom looking immediately across to the restaurant balcony only a few yards away.

The facility is excellent rooms are spacious and well appointed and the amenities consistent with a resort hotel with a wonderful spa bar and fitness centre as you would expect. Service is outstanding from everyone although the one observable difference is in the breakfast service which is sporadic and somewhat stilted although this is only relative to the cheery smiling service from everyone else. Skiing is effortless and movement of equipment is very efficient and the facilities at the base of the mountain take every bit of the unpleasant trek with boots and skis at the end of the day away and replaces it with the ability to hand your skis over at the base of the mountain for them to be returned waxed and tuned the following morning.
