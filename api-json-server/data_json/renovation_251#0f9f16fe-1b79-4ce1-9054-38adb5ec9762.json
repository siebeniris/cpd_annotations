This was our second stay here and definitely the last. The good. the rooms are spacious and you can not hear the traffic from the nearby expressways. The bad. This place is in serious need of a renovation. The rooms are tired and dirty. We had a room on the sixth floor. Obviously there had been some roof leaks because our popcorn ceiling had two large moldy looking bubbles in it. Gross. The couch in the sitting area reeked from mildew. I made the mistake of putting my shirt down on the sofa overnight and the next morning the shirt reeked from mildew. Gross. The hair dryer in the room bolted to the wall would work each day for exactly about 10 seconds. Then it would shut down and not work again. The bathroom was area was dirty and in need of a thorough cleaning. The carpet in the elevators emitted a dirty odor that you could smell from the moment you stepped in. Gross. This traditional weekday business hotel has found a niche for itself in order to fill up the rooms on weekends. They host travelling soccer teams at a discounted rate. The place was overrun with families with small children who ran up and down the hallways screaming at the top of their lungs. The hotel put signs up in the elevators asking people to respect quiet hours from 930pm to 930am but people took the signs down and did what they wanted. Needless to say these families were extremely discourteous of the other guests. We complained after night one about the ceiling. We complained after night two about the hair dryer.

I grew up in Derfield and come back to visit a couple of times a year. I love staying at Hyat properties and do so a lot for work travel. My experience here has been awful over Christmas. First on a positive note the check in and bartender staff are wonderful. That is the reason I gave a rating at all. The fitness center is also nice. I ordered room service for breakfast and there were 2 short dark hairs on the side of my plate. I did not have time to wait for another plate nor did I want to risk it. The room and hotel are not well maintained or cleaned. The bathtub is old and slants in so you can not stand well for showering and after showering there is dirt that collects in the tub that is loosened under the side of the tub from the moisture. The room temperature is too warm and no matter how low I adjusted the temp has not changed. Hyat Hotel are known for their excellence. This hotel is not one I would ever stay at again. The Mariot Suites is old too but well maintained and far more worth the price. Hyat Regency Derfield is due for a major remodel.

I started staying at the Hyat Derfield for work in July 2017 and stayed there almost every week SundayThursday until July 2018 so I know it fairly welFirst the basics. The rooms are all pretty much the same and contain a living room that is separated from the bedroom by a built in tv cabinet. The bathroom is off the bedroom and is decent enough sized. I liked that the countertop in the bathroom had plenty of space for my toiletries. Rooms on the 6th floor are better than other floors and have upgraded beds and bedding. I believe they are also renovating the 6th floor early next year. Lower floor rooms are fine though as I stayed on pretty much every floor at one time or another and did not experience any noise problems. I believe almost all the rooms have keurigs as well. There is an indoor pool and hot tub that looks out over the courtyard. Its ok but nothing special. The workout facility however that connects to the pool is well maintained and easy to use with both weight machines as well as cardio equipment. The courtyard and facilities are clean and well maintained. I recommend sitting out by the fire during the summer. The bar will bring food and drinks out to you which is amazing. Really good service and usually good company while you are at it. The bar is staffed with some of the best bartenders I \u2019ve ever met who have worked there 20 years Angelo. They remember your name your drink and your stories. As a road warrior being able to sit at a hotel bar and feel at home is valuable and not something I will forget. If you are at the bar ask for the blue cheese stuffed olives for your vodka martini. Angelo and Rigo another amazing bartender will know who sent you. The food is really good for a hotel and especially one without a big name restaurant. I recommend the quesadillas hot wings or the chicken sandwich all tasty. The rest of the food is pretty good as well although it used to be better before they changed up the menu in December. With the variety they have it was easy to eat here almost every night. The breakfast is good with fresh fruit put out daily. They also have a mini starbucks to get your coffee fix in the morning. I did n\u2019t eat breakfast here as much just because I \u2019m more of a coffee for breakfast person but the times I did were generally good. At the staff level the front desk people are very friendly and helpful Greg Malcolm Fasilia Nick. I had few problems while I was staying there but any time I did they took care of me quickly. Kerie is a great manager and seems to keep a customer centric focus which kept me and many other regulars coming back week after week. I will say that the rooms do run a bit too hot but I \u2019m to understand that \u2019s because the hvac system is on the older side so be aware of that. Nothing that would keep from staying there but notable nonetheless. Overall the year I stayed here was a good one and I have to thank everyone there for going out of their way to take care of myself and the other guests.
