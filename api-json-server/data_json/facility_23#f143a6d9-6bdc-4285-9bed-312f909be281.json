This was my 2nd stay at this Hilton and I will say that it is one of the better Hiltons in the system. We checked in late and the staff was absolutely great friendly cheerful and efficient. The hotel facility is great with a huge beautiful lobby nice bar and comfortable clean rooms. I will say that I was just a little disappointed in the breakfast in the executive lounge. The space seems a bit too small for the size of the hotel and was quite crowded. Otherwise everything was great.

You can hear some construction sounds in the day time as the hotel is being renovated. 4. The rooms have must smelly like soggy cheesy fries and basement. 5. The heat takes a long while to kick in but it does work. 6. This location does have a shuttle to the airport that runs every thirty mins from 5am1am. Had to come back to add to review the new rooms thermostat stopped functioning. Hotel staff was on it and very accommodating. Unfortunately the thermostat broke 3x and the staff moved us to our 3rd room where water still never really got hot. Also the construction sounds were way too loud all day and even the lobby was covered in dust and interrupted lunch service. If it was not for the amazing customer service I would give a poor review. Looking forward to renovations being complete but you may want to choose a different hotel until renovations are complete. We were in 3 different floors on various sides of the hotel and the noise was outstanding. Also food was good at buffet and room service were delish. Fish tacos and salmon a d potatoes were very good. Airport shuttle service was good. Shuttle left promptly a d driver was great. Grab an earlier shuttle as the shuttle makes a stop to Mariot as well.

I did not change my reservation and was grateful for the advance notice. I have stayed on several different floors where rooms were undergoing renovation at the other end. I never noticed noise. One time I could smell paint when I exited the elevator but once in my room no problem. My rooms have always been clean. I have not yet stayed on a newly renovated floor but hear good progress has been madeI am thrilled that Vinos food menu has expanded since my first stay.
