The Hilton San Diego Resort and Spa nestled at the edge of Mission Bay is a pretty nice place it deserves three and a half stars but I rounded down because of how much it costs. Our room was run of the mill two beds a TV a small patio. The shower was nice but the toilet area was small. There was not enough lighting in the living sleeping area and one lamp had a malfunction that the maintenance staff had to fix. While the housekeepers seemed competent one day our room did not get cleaned we had to call in the evening to get it touched up. Other less than impressive experiences included a bike rental shop that could not open one day because it was locked and they could not come up with a key a business center with three computers all of which at one point were occupied by children playing video games and an outdoor Ping Pong table with really shoddy equipment. On the other hand the pool was fine and the restaurants excellent. We had a fine dinner at Acqua and the next mornings brunch was high class with a satisfyingly wide array of foods. It was not especially cheap but the server undercharged us pretending that several of our kids were young enough for the lower kids price and got a good tip. A coffee and pastry shop opens fairly early 60 am the line there one morning got up to about 15 people before they brought in a second employee. There are a reasonable number of wicker seats some chairs some semi enclosing pods in the general area of the pool and restaurants small fires warm the areas around some of them. A highlight was a massage at the spa everything there was upscale from the robes though the changing area was cramped to the relaxing massage itself to the way we were treated deferentially by everyone from the desk clerks to the masseuses. So there were certainly nice elements to our stay. I just feel that a resort charging these types of prices should be a lot more consistent in providing top notch facilities and services.", "offset": [932, 998], "date": "2016-07-07", "cpt": "0", "category": "pool"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "bf1d1385-ab6a-41d3-91ba-bb5c3b92f420", "sentence": "Excellent place to relax.

The resort itself is fairly nice. The pool and facilities all seemed well maintained and the staff was nice. The room was not the nicest and the TV service was horrible and badly needs updating. The Wi Fi was not great either. All of those were acceptably though my biggest complaint is the fees. I booked this hotel through Expedia for 150 per night. Expedia stated that there would be a 30 night resort fee. Upon arriving we learned that we also have to pay 36 per day for parking. When checking out my total extra bill was over 150. Why can not these fees be part of the hotel stay. Is it just so they can be advertised as cheaper than they really are. Nice location in a not too busy area.

First trip to San Diego and decided to stay here since I am a Diamond member. The team was gracious enough to provide a small upgrade in room type for me and even when I arrived hours before check in time they were able to get me in. The only minor complaint was that my room was located immediately off the elevator and across from a noisy ice machine when my Hilton profile has a preference to be away from the elevator. First night was quiet no issues second night was loud with people yelling in the hallways and stomping around. So glad I travel with ear plugs. We were very confused about the breakfast that was included with being a Diamond member. The first morning we ate at Acqua and were told we could have a hot breakfast where a credit would be applied to the meal in lieu of having just the cold continental with our breakfast coupons and we would pay the difference 10. We were seated and waited for quite a while for any service. We had no idea what we were supposed to do. We finally got menus and then when we ordered we were told the credit was not towards the menu but for a hot buffet that we could have just helped ourselves to and we did not need to wait. Breakfast offerings were more than adequate but service was slow and it was very confusing. 2nd day we tried Aroma and I do not recommend it. 1 coffee 1 juice and 2 items certain muffins certain pastries and fruit. and that is it. We ate at the Olive Lounge for dinner on our last night and enjoyed it very much. The pool was very nice with plenty of lounge chairs towels and fire pits. We had a fire pit all to ourselves on the last night and it was very relaxing. The hotel is in a convenient location and is overall a beautiful property. Yes it is easy to tell in the rooms that they have been mostly updated but still show some signs of wear on the doors or pieces of furniture but overall we were very pleased with our stay and I would certainly consider staying here again. Staff was pleasant and helpful room was clean and comfortable. Fun fact we found our fridge in the closet. Obviously not enough outlets. We had a good laugh about that. oh but 38 for parking is kind of insane.", "offset": [1513, 1586], "date": "2017-05-11", "cpt": "0", "category": "pool"}, {"id": 4, "uid": "8e6ceb73-9349-435b-bb7f-d87bd0c9a0ab", "sentence": "Great little vacation getaway spot for kids.

The smell was not inside the room though. The grounds were very nice. We were able to check out some tennis racquets and about 20 or so tennis balls to play some tennis. The gym is also very nice. The pool area is large and has lots of seating and cabanas. Cabanas were for rent but during off peak are open to anyone. We took advantage of their game room where a large screen was set up for a movie. Various board games corn hole and ping pong were available. It was a nice place to hang out after dinner. There is a full service bar with a decent happy hour selection. Outside of the property gates is a walking trail around the bay.

What a great experience. We came in today on Resortpas since we are locals. We also met two other couples that were on day passes. Our cabana rental was less than 1500.

Drinks range from hmph I did not pay attention to that detail but we have 6 real drinks and spend less than 100. The pool area is enclosed but a simple walk to the back gate and you exit to the bay. Here is what you get. The cabana is perfect for two. There are two very comfortable and padded chaise lounge chairs that recline all the way back for sleeping. Cabanas are two per section. If you wanted to rent two then the area is great for four and you are not far away. There is a 13 in flat screen tv. uneventful. The cabana comes with a portable charger that fits one USB and charger for android type of inserts. I am sure they may have an apple option. A bag of mixed chips two waters and excellent customer service. There is a pool obviously a childrens kidie pool with simple water feature and perfect for infants up to 5 and nonswiming adults andtwo Jacuzis. The property was immaculate at all times. The pool was immaculate at all times. Savanag was our host. First she greeted is with a genuine smile. She was personable had a humble demeanor answered irrelevant questions and assured us that she was a moments request away and she was. Chris was our server. Despite how crowded it was he was attentive responsive and no matter where we sat he was keeping an eye on us. Hey we are hot chicks. No he was like this with all guests. Bre the manager come to our aide because we had a question. It is truly enjoyable to see that management and line persons are genuinely customer service oriented. They took interest in us as guests and encouraged us to be a part of the atmosphere for future days to come. Bre was also responsive to our needs and we appreciated it greatly. Ronaldo Qis the food and beverage manager. The picture itself of the Bloody Mary will wow you. If you have considered trying one and decided otherwise this one must be tried and savored. If you have a Bloody Mary palette then your taste buds will be doing the tango. We were also prepared a razzle dazzle champagne combo that too was delicious. And truly a gentleman. A kind man. He wants his customers to be gratified rather than satisfied. We had an ebullient time. I would recommend for friends and couples. If the price was lowered I would come twice monthly without a blink of an eye. No plugs available. Charge your laptops ipads ahead of time. We also had our wireless speaker linked into Pandora.
