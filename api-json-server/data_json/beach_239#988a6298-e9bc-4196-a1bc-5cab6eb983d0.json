From the moment we arrived at the One Only counter we felt welcomed pampered and indulged. Lovely trip over from Hamilton to Hayman sipping champagne. Smooth ride do not forget the sun screen. Room to sit inside in this stunning launch. Arrived at the Marina and the staff were all there to welcome us no waiting straight to resort and into the safe hands of our friendly Butler Alie. Reservations were confirmed new ones were made itinerary printed out low stress. Alie showed us to On The Rocks for a beautiful lunch then returned to show us to our room. I had agonised over what to book not sure if the two bedroom was worth the price. it was. Beautifully presented cool spacious well appointed. Two super comfortable king size beds Huge deep long bath. In house movies three plasma TVs. Great view of iconic Hayman pool and beach. That was the start of a really memorable three night stay. did not get to try Bamboo as it was closed the night we had allocated but Alie sorted other options Amici was good and Aquazure was a stand out. Get down to Aquazure on sunset watch the bats with the sun setting over the ocean. stunning. Breakfast at Pacific was indulgent coffee lovely staff attentive and service prompt. Worth knowing the resort is cashles. You can pay cash when finalising bill but for day to day credit card or room charge are the only choices. A pre pay option is available so you can ease the pain before you arrive with a direct transfer into their Commonwealth bank account. This worked well for us. Went on 2 snorkeling trips beautiful turtles at Langford Island and amazing coral and fish at Blue Pearl Bay 2 close to shore. Wear reef shoes at Blue Pearl as not a sandy beach. Taken out to these sites in a speed boat group of six. Hayman provide beach chairs towels water umbrella stinger suites. Water in pools warm sea water also warm. Day spa excellent. book activities before you go an email to guest services to lock your choices in. This was a memorable stay for all the right reasons. It is a stunning resort with incredible gardens and wildlife. Staff are enthusiastic friendly and have a problem solving positive approach. We felt we got a five star service in a five star resort.

There has been mixed reviews ever since this luxury resort has reopened after it is multimilion dollar makeover. Like all things I for one will withhold judgement until I experience it firsthand. All I can honestly say after spending four days there with both our girls is that they have superseded our expectations on many levels. The resort is immaculately presented and the area is expansive. There are a few restaurants there but our personal favourites are Aquazure and Amici. Tasty tapas and Italian respectively. If you have children you will adore the newly built family pool. Initially I pictured family pools to be one big space with children splashing like maniacs and noise levels skyrocketing upward. This one has essentially 5 separate areas ingeniously designed to flow from one to another right next to comfy cabanas decks and the beach. If you have toddlers you will love the super warm water and sand in the first area. It is basically a miniature beach but without you having to monitor their every single move there are plenty of opportunities for you to sip your cocktail and enjoy the delicious seafood paella. The little ones would enjoy the mini burgers if you are able to successfully pry them away from the waters. The next stage is where many would describe as the Isle of cushion right in the middle of the pool. Great for photos during sunset. The deeper end which any adult can easily touch the bottom of the floor is usually shaded in the evenings so your angels can enjoy swimming from 3 pm onwards without worrying too much about the sun damage. I see many couples there enjoying the sunset by the infinity pool not at all concerned by the children around. When you get too tired relaxing you can hop into the spa which is located to the left of the infinity pool. This is a nice spacious area with powerful jets that do not require you to get up every 5 minutes to switch them on. If the water does get too hot then you can have the option to jump into the plunge pool at the opposite end which probably has the depth of 18 m. The rooms are spacious and beautifully appointed with amenities made in Italy the little ones receive a pack of organic products from UK with beautiful smelling wash cloth and cute bedroom slippers. Kids club is an absolute must to visit. You will be doing your children a disfavour if you think you had want to be parent of the year by spending all your time with them. We took the helicopter ride to Whitehaven beach it is one of the top 5 beaches in the world for a reason. I will not spoil it for you you just need to go. Money does buy experience here and it is worth the time and. The 15mins journey there is a WOW factor in itself. The ride was smooth with plenty of commentary on the way. Snorkeling was great fun. We managed to see two sea turtles on Langford Island. If you are not keen to breathe through your mouth it does not really make a difference as we spotted the turtles straight from the beach in knee high waters. We could have touched them had we stretched out our hands. There are lots more but they have already been covered by other positive reviewers so you can read those. Our only regret was not to book for a longer stay. We would have skipped the start of school term if we had known what a truly amazing place this would be. A big special thank you to our butler Cristian Hayley Kaila Brikesh and the team at One Only. Our thanks to housekeeping to the watersports group and the luxury cruise transfer staff. Keep up your warm hospitality and smiles as you are the ones that make a good place GREAT.", "offset": [2804, 2857], "date": "2015-02-01", "cpt": "0", "category": "beach"}, {"id": 3, "uid": "a1b4e4ce-fb87-454b-bd1f-3366ec6f5938", "sentence": "One and Only Hayman. We enjoyed the Premium Ocean View Room but the Pool side rooms also looked good if being right by the pool is preferable. We tried all the restaurants and our favourite was Amici as there were enough Italian dishes to choose from and we came across the best waiter there. Fire was also quite good but expensive. We did not have a good waiter for lunch at Aquazure who ignored everyone except one family. We had to keep going over to the register each time we wanted to order something. The food portions were also exceptionally small there too. The people at the Marina went out of there way to book activities for us so I am really grateful for their help even though the weather did not permit some things to go ahead. I really enjoyed the trip to Langford Island for a couple of hours. It was wonderful to see all the turtles and even dolphins on the way back to Hayman. Jacko is such a superstar. he is a lot of fun to feed. We also loved the Heart Reef helicopter trip with great views of the GBR. When it did rain we enjoyed a foot massage and facial. I have to say it was the best facial I have ever had.

Being a frequent traveller all classes and holiday types and truly capable of differentiating this place is a rip off. Why are we writing the review. Warning other people hoping to have the biggest leverage on Mngt. to change the way the place is run. We spent our money do not waste yours. And yes one of the only places we havnt read TripAdvisor in advance Wanted to go there expected to receive what we pay for and not a type of hotel we would expected to have to read a TA reviewWhat we came for a relaxing and deserted stay at the end of a 2month AUS Roundtrip wanting to revisit the Whitsundays and the GB Reef. Been to multiple WS Islands sailed around all of them in an own boat never set foot on Hayman so far. Off Season stay fully aware that Feb is not the time of the year to visit this region. but on this island you can reach a pretty dry and sunny compromise due to its distance from the mainland. This Island is unique beautiful cove beach well sheltered nice fauna and flora and its own island reef it is paradise. The Hotel on it a disgrace for what could be done out of it. It was refurbished only 9month ago and we guess most of the AUD 85 m. were spent on some exclusive beach villas one new restaurant and pool which are all very nice and live up to expected standards in terms of architecture design and atmosphere created. The vast majority aprox 95 of all rooms got a repaint and some new furniture. Tilling bathrooms windows balcony are still in an old state. So here is a structured but not exhaustive reviewTRANSFER FROM HAMILTON ISLAND. Transfer is with a show off boat left in a not so show off state. In conditions and utilization like the boat is set out to do so it just needs a fresh water scrub every day which it does not receive captain and crew are not a team. Just hope you will never have to relay on them. Being a skipper myself I would have a little more pride in my maneuvers scrapping along a jetty then bouncing into the next one are not really signature moves. Soaked foot mats left to dry on sofas and aperos tables not very classy. The price you pay for the transfer is most probably higher than the price you paid for your air fare. A distance of 20 nm at a speed of 20kn have surly got their fuel price. But disposing AUD 30 p on arrival just to get to the Island and back well just hide the cost in the room rates or something like that. As a customer you feel like some what milked you got no alternative choice then to just bite on it. The transfer is nice captain will try to avoid waves and currents move along the sheltered coast and keep passengers as dry as possible. you will be served plenty of boubly poor steward needs to wash all the glasses by hand in the boats kitchen do not look into it nor the glass and cutlery you are left with. Just get used to it because it does not get any better once your on the island. CLEANLINESS OF ROOMS. bellow average arrived still finding lots of hair every where in the room shower floor. It can happen might have forgotten to vacuum the room mentioned it and got it re vacuumed straight away concierge reacted instantly then def. knowing where they come from. If staff does not tie back their hair and unsystematically zig zags diagonally through the room with a vacuum cleaner it pulls through gang ways with the brush on the floor. Well it will never get any cleaner. Bathroom shower sink have their moldy spots and corners. To be expected in the tropics and a back packers due to constant humidity. But not a standard for a room costing AUD 80 a night. def. lacking systematic scrubs and appropriate technical equipment. They do not just appear over night. Housekeeping is poorly trained monitored and equipped. Room service and turndown service is done daily but they might miss out on the one or another occasionally so keep your towels hung up in case they miss out on the one or other service. Laundry except of stains on decoration pillows and dusty curtains nothing to complain. They are well boiled and bleached. CLEANLINESS OF FACILITIES AND PUBLIC AREAS. ok. but again a lot more could be done. Be aware this is a remote island exposed to wind weather salt and wildlife. Tree leafs sand and Bird Po are inevitable in gang ways pools sunchairs and on your balcony. Guests feeding birds surly do not help either. But it is nature it is why people come here. The facility is huge it surely takes a lot of resources to keep it tidy. Gardens are vast pools gigantic. But still there are major no goes happening. Although gangways are bird cleaned once in a while this is done with a mope diluting and spreading the excrements everywhere and not actually removing them. Mngt. get your staff a floor cleaning machine with a rotating brush and a vacuum. it is a question of efficiency. An other no go is cleaning balconies bird excrements with bathroom towels and a water sprayer. let us just hope laundry is boiled. An other no go washing pool furniture like sunchairs and pillows in the pool itself whilst guests are swimming. Or using pool towels to whip off bird po. Again staff is poorly trained not motivated and badly equipped. Walking around with empty hands most of the time is not the way you work in a luxury 5star hotel. Not when there is plastic bottles straws cans cocktail glasses laying around which they just step over. And they are not hidden but very obvious to see. RESTAURANTS. In general they are all good cook well and have menus starting at adequate prices Considering an Island surcharge of corse offering dining in an ok atmospheres. Nothing that will make you go WOW but they cook well and are some what authentic to their theme country. All thought the facility is extremely spaces and you feel like your more or less alone all day long. Restaurants are very tightly seated and all crowded. Little outside dinning is offered. This is most probably a result of old building architecture that would need a complete rip down if wanted to layout differently. They tried their best put some attention into detail but again nothing that will make you go wow. SERVICE RESTAURANT BAR STAFFING. In general all staff is friendly some down from the heart doing their job with passion. Most mostly the local ones having their 6month pocket money brush up stay give you the fake friendliness you pay for when booking. And that is where the difference comes from. Most staff will only do what they are assigned to do. Not help out each other nor do any common sense task. Walk by a left table 10x and not cleaning it up because it is not their assigned table. Never seen so many service people walking around with empty hands. Usually there is one or two people doing a great job whilst the other ten are just walking around like lost chucks. Where does it come from. well there are simply no Station Chiefs no one keeping an upper birds eye view of what needs to be done. do not be surprised if your left without a coffee at brake fast and then asked three times for a coffee the next day. The Chef de Bar at one pool will take your order make the drinks serve the drinks arrange towels and refit umbrellas whilst people assigned to recreation will walk over an empty glass 10x nor see that there are new guest arriving that would need a towel. They are mostly still hung over from the Staff Party from the night before hide behind their sunies or in their office taking a nap on the desk. But again there is no one there really responsible nor designated to assign tasks. Most of the staff are interns or high school kids on their 6month pocket money brush up missing any guidance nor training. They try their best but they receive no help no supervision and are pretty much left to themselves. In the end the place is totally miss managed has no hierarchy and very very disappointedly run. The only thing done well is selling you drinks. you will be asked in a 10min interval if you want a drink or snack at the pool. But again they will walk over an empty glass whilst doing so because the person is designated to take orders and not clean up. do not bother ordering a cocktail or something like that. Very highly diluted with ice no taste. Stick to what comes straight out of a bottle or can. On the premiss there is only one chef the bar you can actually call one. you will figure out quickly who he is hint he will be the one handing over towels putting up umbrellas serving and taking orders at the same time he is the only one actually having an eye for the work he does and he does a lot more then he would need to do. But that is it. Rest of people working or pretending to do so is really badly trained and simply does not have the standards nor the eye that would be required for a place like this. ACTIVITIES. well you go to the GB reef so anything with water sports would be the main goal. Be aware weather is key for this 25kn at the outer reef are no fun you will not see anything anyways. But in general trip offerings are very scares and about 3x the price of any other destination. They offer one trip to the outer reef a week. But it might happen that you get get crossed of the list if some one comes along and rents the boat for a private trip. So you might end up coming to the GB reef and not actually seeing it even if weather would allow to do so. Anything that is complementary is very poor it is not near a Club Med standard you will find newer surf boards SUPs Kaiaks and HobyCats at any garage sale. They will gladly sell you a Helicopter18hole golf trip for AUD 160. Even if there are 35kn of wind but do not expect to receive a Hobby Cat Windsurfer or anything when there is actually sailable wind. But you can go WakeBoarding and Jetsking in choppy conditions that are no fun they can earn AUD the hour on it not telling them of for not advising you off it. You can do diving with their own dive centre. Just be aware prices again are 3 4x that of what you would pay somewhere else. A daily dive trip is close to the price of a multi day dive safari in other parts of the world. All in all see your stay as a comedy you paid to much money for and that you actually find yourself trapped in till you leave. Never paid so much to be able to do so litledo not get us wrong we enjoyed our stay in terms of remote location in the heart of the GB riff. Weather beach and island where beautiful. Swims and snorkels lovely. Just the stay at the hotel is way off the level you would expect to receive from the price tag that comes with it. Worst value for money ever spent. All issues where addressed to management and this is where the best part of the story comes. They will not even dine it when spoken to. They are fully aware that they are not offering what they charge for. We feel sorry for restaurants and fb management that listened to all our complaints. They seem left with little support the hotel manager is more of a representative figure well informed about weather but will not have the guts to come speak to you in person asked multiple times never came bye.", "offset": [983, 1101], "date": "2015-02-20", "cpt": "0", "category": "beach"}, {"id": 6, "uid": "0a34a054-ec3f-4c78-8bb4-6f4a709551e6", "sentence": "A special place experiancing major growing pains. My wife 2 teenage daughters and I travelled to Australia from New Jersey for a 2wek family vacation over Christmas and New Years. One and Only Hayman Island was our 2nd of 3 stops while in Australia. We were met at Great Barrier Reef airport and brought to the One and Only Reception room while the OO staff gathered our luggage. We choose the seaplane transfer which I highly suggest. First of all we were not on anyone \u2019s schedule. As soon as our luggage was picked up we got on the plane and quickly departed for Hayman Island. The flight was 25 minutes or so and was very scenic. It was a real thrill landing on the water and much smoother than we anticipated. Once in the water we taxied thru One Only \u2019s small harbor and rode up onto the island. There we met Sean our personal Butler for the next six days. Shawn Dickson was incredible and made us feel very special many times during our stay which I will get into further detail later on in this review. First of all let me say that we loved our stay at Hayman Island One and Only. It is definitely one of the most special places we have ever been and the most fun we have had on vacation. That said we noticed many issues which we attributed to growing pains. Its funny to suggest that a 50 year old iconic resort has growing pains but Hayman had only been taken over by One Only about 5 months earlier. Let me be clear there were lots of issues but the positives outweigh the negatives by a very large margin. It was hot and humid while we were there 90 or so during the day. The air conditioning in restaurants was not adequate and in many cases not working properly. This was a very big issue for me and made dinning a very uncomfortable experience. We heard many others complain as well. Fortunately this is a very relaxed island so wearing shorts was fine. The pools and beach area were all stunning. At low tied it seems like you can walk forever without the water going above your ankles. We got complementary cabanas at the signature pool for the entire time of our stay because we were in a beach villa. Both pools are spectacular but the signature is set up really perfectly. To our surprise no one ever came by the pool or beach with refreshing snacks like fruit or sorbet like is done at other One Only \u2019s we have stayed at. Much of the staff is extremely inexperienced. These were mostly very very young kids learning on the go. Many of them said it was their first real job. They did not seem well trained or experienced in the hospitality industry. However everyone was extremely nice and It was refreshing because they came with no attitude. This was a big surprise to us for a One Only but was not a big issue for us because this is such a relaxed place. It felt like much of the staff was thrown together. It was kind of strange when someone who was getting you towels at the pool might be the person serving you dinner at one of the restaurants later that night. Before going to Hayman I spoke with a manager who was at the old Hayman Island before One Only took over. He told me that he expected that One Only would be in for a surprise because hospitality service in Australia is very different then their brand is know for and expects from its employees. Australian hospitality is much less formal and more relaxed then One Only style of service around the world. He suggested that there would be growing pains. The property was dead at night. There was vibe missing and this was over Christmas New Years the busiest time of the year. There were no outdoor bars open at night. This was such a waste because there are so many great settings for them on the property. Not having an outdoor bar with music at night was sorely missed and a disappointment. The one indoor bar is nice but was mostly dead too. The bartenders at that bar did seem experienced which made seem out of place. I reluctantly bought 2 Cuban cigars that I normally pay approximately 15 in Europe the Caribbean. I believe they were charging approximately 160 at the bar. I found this offensive of the hotel. Normally I would smoke 1 or 2 cigars a day at a beach vacation. I only had 2 because of the pricing. I realize everything had to be brought to this island but there is minimal shipping cost for a box of cigars. I heard 2 people mention to me that they would have bought some if they were n\u2019t so ridiculously priced. It ca n\u2019t be tax related because I bought some similarly priced Cubans at the hotel near Sydney and they were maybe 300 markup rather then 1000 plus markup. This is wrong for a hotel to do. Because of our past experiences at other One and Only locations we expected exceptional food. We could not have been more disappointed with the food at One Only Hayman Island. The food at the breakfast buffet was just fine but it was virtually impossible to get someone \u2019s attention to bring you a drink or coffee. We had lunch at both pools and tried all of the restaurants where we found the selection both limited and the preparations and combinations were odd and unappetizing. There was a limited selection of seafood salads comfort foods and sandwiches. No amazing burger club sandwich or great salad. It was so disappointing. The food was just bad. and basic goto items. How bout some shrimp on the barbieThe Italian restaurant was horrible. The red sauce tasted like red burnt oil. The pizza was ok but nothing else was good and most items were not even edible. I had fish soup that had so many ingredients that did not belong. It really was odd. The pasta and fish was not better. They could not even get some very basic Italian dishes decent enough to enjoy. Once again we heard so many others with the same complaints. We went to the buffet one night which is on the beach. We decided to leave after looking at the limited options on the buffet. We also found it way too bright and not intimate. This was a beautiful setting wasted. The signature restaurant has ok steak options but the appetizers sides deserts and other entrees once again had a bizarre combination of ingredients and preparations. Get basic right before you try to get fancy right. We did end up eating here twice because of our issue with the other places so we ordered plain steak. We did enjoy the Asian restaurant very much and ate here 2 nights. There were several things on the menu my family liked very much. But the air was not working in this restaurant so we were dripping wet by the time we left. Service at the restaurants was very spotty and extremely slow at times. This is too special a place to have such horrible dinning experience. I can easily say that this is the worst possible dinning of any hotel that I can recall. This is a One Only I should be raving about the food. One Only Hayman Island must start again from scratch and hire a new executive chef. I would be very surprised if they have not gotten this message loud and clear by now so I am hopeful this will be corrected. I strongly suggest that as soon as you book this trip you contact the concierge to book excursions as helicopter and seaplanes book up quickly. The hotel should contact people when they book to ensure they get what they want. Imagine travelling half way across the world to see or do something to only find that it \u2019s not available. This nearly happened to me but hotel management worked hard to make sure I was able to do what we came to do. There was Wifi and cell service on the island but it was unreliable most of the time. The hotel had some live music though out the property. The music was like the food preparation odd and bad. It was unpleasant to listen to. The music at the Asian restaurant was a series of loud random noises. If you told me it was a bunch of 5 year olds playing instruments I would believe it. The fancy restaurant had some lady with a bad voice singing horrible songs. We saw people around the restaurant giggling. Our server even had to contain her laughter. Some of the music at the pool was fine all retro 70s 80s from CD. We had a Beach Villa and Retreat Room. The retreat rooms are behind the beach villas away from the beach. Our kids stayed in the retreat room which was perfect for them. The beach villas were amazing a unique design with a pool between the bathroom and bedroom. They were absolutely beautiful. Next to the pool is a covered walkway which also serves as a mini bar and pantry. The bedroom opened to a terrace right on the beach. These rooms could not be any nicer. Our butler Shawn did many things to make our stay special. On Christmas he gave me a LV wallet my wife a ESL Scarf and diving gear for the kids for Christmas. This was very generous of Shawn and the hotel. Also one day we chartered a Seaplane for a areal sightseeing tour and snorkeling of the great barrier reef to take us to Whitehaven beach. This was the most incredible day. What we did not know was that Shawn arranged for the Seaplane to drop us off at our room on the beach where he was waiting with cocktails. It was a little embarrassing as everyone wanted to see who was getting out of the plane but special never the less. I am hopeful that much of the issues we experienced are because the hotel is only recently opened after a long renovation and more significantly a change in management companies. I know that I focused on a lot of negatives. This is for 2 reasons. First because it is do unusual to see these types of issues at a brand like a One Only. The other reason is because this place is so special and I want to see it correct these things. Even if nothing got fixed I would still go back.", "offset": [581, 633], "date": "2015-02-22", "cpt": "0", "category": "beach"}, {"id": 7, "uid": "0a34a054-ec3f-4c78-8bb4-6f4a709551e6", "sentence": "A special place experiancing major growing pains.

How bout some shrimp on the barbieThe Italian restaurant was horrible. The red sauce tasted like red burnt oil. The pizza was ok but nothing else was good and most items were not even edible. I had fish soup that had so many ingredients that did not belong. It really was odd. The pasta and fish was not better. They could not even get some very basic Italian dishes decent enough to enjoy. Once again we heard so many others with the same complaints. We went to the buffet one night which is on the beach. We decided to leave after looking at the limited options on the buffet. We also found it way too bright and not intimate. This was a beautiful setting wasted. The signature restaurant has ok steak options but the appetizers sides deserts and other entrees once again had a bizarre combination of ingredients and preparations. Get basic right before you try to get fancy right. We did end up eating here twice because of our issue with the other places so we ordered plain steak. We did enjoy the Asian restaurant very much and ate here 2 nights. There were several things on the menu my family liked very much. But the air was not working in this restaurant so we were dripping wet by the time we left. Service at the restaurants was very spotty and extremely slow at times. This is too special a place to have such horrible dinning experience. I can easily say that this is the worst possible dinning of any hotel that I can recall. This is a One Only I should be raving about the food. One Only Hayman Island must start again from scratch and hire a new executive chef. I would be very surprised if they have not gotten this message loud and clear by now so I am hopeful this will be corrected. I strongly suggest that as soon as you book this trip you contact the concierge to book excursions as helicopter and seaplanes book up quickly. The hotel should contact people when they book to ensure they get what they want. Imagine travelling half way across the world to see or do something to only find that it \u2019s not available. This nearly happened to me but hotel management worked hard to make sure I was able to do what we came to do. There was Wifi and cell service on the island but it was unreliable most of the time. The hotel had some live music though out the property. The music was like the food preparation odd and bad. It was unpleasant to listen to. The music at the Asian restaurant was a series of loud random noises. If you told me it was a bunch of 5 year olds playing instruments I would believe it. The fancy restaurant had some lady with a bad voice singing horrible songs. We saw people around the restaurant giggling. Our server even had to contain her laughter. Some of the music at the pool was fine all retro 70s 80s from CD. We had a Beach Villa and Retreat Room. The retreat rooms are behind the beach villas away from the beach. Our kids stayed in the retreat room which was perfect for them. The beach villas were amazing a unique design with a pool between the bathroom and bedroom. They were absolutely beautiful. Next to the pool is a covered walkway which also serves as a mini bar and pantry. The bedroom opened to a terrace right on the beach. These rooms could not be any nicer. Our butler Shawn did many things to make our stay special. On Christmas he gave me a LV wallet my wife a ESL Scarf and diving gear for the kids for Christmas. This was very generous of Shawn and the hotel. Also one day we chartered a Seaplane for a areal sightseeing tour and snorkeling of the great barrier reef to take us to Whitehaven beach. This was the most incredible day. What we did not know was that Shawn arranged for the Seaplane to drop us off at our room on the beach where he was waiting with cocktails. It was a little embarrassing as everyone wanted to see who was getting out of the plane but special never the less. I am hopeful that much of the issues we experienced are because the hotel is only recently opened after a long renovation and more significantly a change in management companies. I know that I focused on a lot of negatives. This is for 2 reasons. First because it is do unusual to see these types of issues at a brand like a One Only. The other reason is because this place is so special and I want to see it correct these things. Even if nothing got fixed I would still go back.", "offset": [8721, 8859], "date": "2015-02-22", "cpt": "0", "category": "beach"}, {"id": 8, "uid": "3c69b4aa-5b59-4c49-b6ee-4328f7a2a382", "sentence": "ah mazing. We stayed here for a long weekend to celebrate our first anniversary in an Ocean View room. This hotel is the complete package. It is total luxury. Breakfast at Pacific was good there is a really large selection. I think that the only let down was the bacon. Being Aussies and getting an American style bacon on home soil was not so exciting but something called maple bacon made us feel a little better. We had lunch by the pool at either OTR or Aquazure. One small frustrations on our first day after 6 hours of travel the wait for a burger was 45 min. I completely understand human error and we saw the chef frustrated that he had 2 dockets for the same table number but it did not help when the table next to us took our order and ate it. But every day following was perfect. Special mention to Gisele I do not think this is the right spelling at Aquazure she was fantastic very helpful and friendly. We had dinner at both Bamboo and Fire unfortunately we could not eat at Amici as this was only open for one night on the weekend that we stayed and it was booked out. Call up before your stay to find these things out if you would like to try all the restaurants or when turn down is done a daily newsletter is put out for you that will let you know what is going on the next day. Otherwise go to Fire and order the tomahawk it is hands down the best thing we ate during our stay. The room was spacious and clean. If our do not disturb was on the butler service would ring through to check if we needed anything or a note was left at the door for us to call and the services would be done at any time we like. We did have an outer reef discovery tour booked which was unfortunately cancelled due to weather but the staff then helped us arrange to get some massages. Over all this is the perfect resort. Whilst there were a few mistakes I think that we can allow for human error and realize that we are on island time and also on holidays meaning that we are in no rush. We came home well rested and telling everyone how fabulous it was.

The One Only resort is situated on Hayman Island which is the most northerly island of the Whitsundays. The island is private and apart from the resort and a few private properties is a nature reserve and protected. The One Only group purchased the island relatively recently and has spent significant time and effort in renovating and improving both the island and the resort. We flew into Hamilton Island and then took the hotels launch to Hayman. Our first view of the One Only resort was therefore amazing approaching the island on the launch with the deep green of the trees juxtaposed against a deep blue sea and a clear sky shot through with white fluffy clouds. The location is just idyllic and the amenities available are incredible. There are multiple restaurants two pools a beautifully clean beach a private marina and helicopter excursions with snorkeling or golf. The resort is well set out with a central area housing the reception and restaurants plus two bedroom wings each with its own pool. The rooms are also really well designed and comfortable. Each room has a balcony overlooking the sea pool where one can relax or have an informal meal a sitting area with a sofa large chair desk and two comfortable arm chairs a four poster bed plus a separate dressing room and a large bathroom. Unfortunately there were issues and these were predominantly service related. During our three days there were multiple incidents where service was less than ideal examples include there is a 24 hour room service available with an expected half hour delivery but our meal took over 50 minutes to arive we had to call three times over a period of 2 hours before our tray was picked up from our room after the meal the staff service the rooms in the evening and you can call to have someone come if you are not available when they try to visit. We called for the service however they did not arrive so after an hour and a half we called again only to be told that the staff had now finished for the evening and were no longer available we had pre booked an island sunset excursion and were given paperwork on arrival at the hotel telling us to meet at 160 at reception to take the launch to the island. At the reception we were told they had given us the wrong time and we would need to come back an hour laterAlthough none of these incidents were major they were disappointing and seemed to reflect a general lack of management coordination and training. Hopefully this is something that will be addressed as these issues should not be happening in a hotel that positions itself as a top level establishment.

The service as noted in many reviews here prevents the One Only from joining the ranks of the worlds best beach resorts. Are the glitches enough to spoil your stay. No. Would I book here again if given the choice. Yes. First the positivesThe hotel may have a 70s Cancun vibe on the outside stark white and Brutalist but the recent renovations are nothing short of spectacular. In the Pool Wing the number of rooms was cut in half to create suites each with one of the better bathroom set ups we have experienced the free standing tubs are really cool and exceedingly roomy. The bed is heavenly with great linens and pillows. The A C and wifi free thank you were both really good for such a remote place. Room tip. All the Pool Wing rooms are identical although some have direct pool access with private but exposed decks. Only about 10 percent of these ever seemed to be used so I had skip the extra cost and go for a second or third floor romBonus room tip. An extra guest can stay in your suite on a nice cot for 130 a night including breakfast. there is a sliding door that keeps the living dining separate from the bedroom so this could be a smart option for any groups of threThe original pool is truly spectacular the size of five Olympic pools we were repeatedly told. And no kids. So niceFod is awesome everywhere except the fancy Fire steak place which is weirdly empty most nights. Ask about the wine buffet option at some of the restaurants that lets you try unlimited wines for about 30 bucks eachThe activities were really great and some quite reasonable. We did the sunset sail which was lovely. Another sunset we got dropped off on a nearby sandbar which was great as well. If you are spending this much on your room you should pony up a bit more and take a flight over the Great Barrier Reef. We chose the seaplane option which gave us better views than the smallish looking helicopter and also landed right on the reef to allow us to do some snorkeling. On the way back we stopped at Whitehaven Beach. Order a picnic basket and some wine like we did and you will have an unforgettable experience. It worked out to about 750 a person but was the highlight of the tripI also had a massage over the water in the bay. Another expensive but totally memorable experience. Now about that serviceThe average age of the staff seems to be about 22 which means the staff here is friendly but very very inexperienced. Many of them seem to be Aussie kids doing a gap year. I think they just do not know that it is not cool while you are working to chat on your cell phone or talk about issues with your boss or stand around talking to your work budiesThere are lots of staff but they seem to be oddly deployed. On one day at the recreation centre for instance there were five staff and only four customers. Our guided bird walk had two staff and three participants. Yet getting a drink around the original pool routinely took at least half an hour. Like others I had strongly advise you to book every last activity well in advance including dinners and massages. My travel agent told me trying to arrange these via email was a nightmare. Once at the resort the concierge desk was a bit of a mess. Trying to book reservations for dinner devolved into a who is on first routine. And there were never written confirmations of anything in our roms a simple thing that would make a big diferenceIt became a running joke in our room that the guest services line would always go unanswered. Like 20 times. Another simple fix you had think. All of these issues could be fixed quite easily with better management and training.

Shame about the food service. My wife and I wanted to spend a couple of days at a special location. We chose One and Only although had some concerns after reading negative comments re the dining. Firstly it has to be said that the resort is brilliantly laid out with beautiful gardens and the refurbished rooms overlooking large pool are great. Staff are all very friendly and show a genuine interest in guests wellbeing. Yes the beach is tidal however that is the overall situation at all destinations in this part of Australia. We were terribly disappointed with food service. From afternoon tea to dinner the staff have no idea at all and no system in food service. After being greeted it took ages for someone to take drink order and then an interminable wait to actually get it. This happened at all outlets. At conclusion of dinner all staff seemed to be doing other things and even after standing at reception desk we still could not get our bill without chasing up someone. I might add that the restaurant was around 60 full. Amicis food bland lasagne ragout and over salted at least the waitperson was prompt. Breakfast Buffet was excellent but coffee service very slow. The Asian themed restaurant was closed a big pity as our party was looking forward to dining there. This was a Sat night. The cost of the 50 min launch transfer at 195 p each way is ridiculous. yes it was a nice launch and yes the crew were friendly but at just under 80 per couple return it is outrageous for such a resort. We are disappointed as this resort has so much potential however until there is a decent service training regime in place it will continue to get reviews such as this. I might add that these sentiments were shared by others and when one of our party mentioned our disappointment in the service at a retail outlet they were told such complaints were commonplace.

We decided to move room to the Beach villa and change butler which was a good move and the room is cheaper. Make sure u book all your day trips and choice of restaurants and activities way in advance as they can not keep up with the demand. This can be very bad if u hoped to visit the outer reef.

The resort is truly 5 and is an incredible destination but when we visited in March 2015 we found the edge was taken off slightly by some pretty indifferent food service. I would score it 6 stars for the resort and 3 stars for service at that time anyway. The trip started off very well that must be one of the most impressive airport to resort transfers in the world. Normally we think of a longish motorboat transfer as a bit of a chore but in this case the yacht used for the trip was an amazing trip in itself and I could not fault the arrivals process. The resort itself situated on its own island is incredible and the standard of the resort facilities is spectacular. We stayed in a beach villa which there are only 8 of. I have to say that the layout where the bedroom is separated from the bathroom by the pool is a bit odd and actually not ideal from a practical perspective. But the real issue for us over the whole week was the service standards. There were not 5 at all. We found that housekeeping was patchy and reponse to basic requests was hit miss. Also the service at lunch was outright poor. We were not impressed either by the availability of food options. I felt the problem was basically under staffing. So at lunch especially the staff who were there were great but they were probaly at 50 of the required number even though the resort was not even busy at that time. At breakfast and dinner lots of basic errors were made. Even with the shortcomings it was still a great trip but I hope that management will address this shortfall in service and food offering.

It was fast moving spacious and comfortable but people did get sea sick due to the rough weather\u2022Hayman Wing vs Pool Wing and Pools With our older children we probably would have preferred the Pool Wing which is closer to the main pool whereas the Hayman Wing is closer to the kids pool. The main pool is fantastically large and can be entered directly off the decks of many of the first floor rooms in the Pool Wing. It is filled with salt water maybe saltier than sea water and is unheated so quite brisk in June. But it has a fun layout and we all took swims in it over the course of our stay. The kids pool is freshwater heated which meant we could stay in it for longer has a shallow sand filled section for toddler play a wheelchair ramp entry and several sections of varying depths three of which look out over the beach and are infiniti pools with stunning views. We had fun in it. On the down side neither of the pools had a hot tub for warming up after a cold winter swim. FOOD. Food was decidedly unremarkable and VERY expensive. Menus are very limited if you eat at one place repeatedly. No good alternatives for between meal snacks and obviously since you are on an island nowhere else to go. Service was extremely slow which is okay at dinner time but not when starving and looking for a lunch snack in the middle of the day with kids. Booking in advance is VERY important for dinners. We booked at the same time as we made our room reservations two months in advance and still could not get a reservation before 8PM. \u2022Pacific. Pretty great breakfast bufet\u2022Azure.

When we arrived the tour group was already there and left before us before sunset I think. Very rocky trail that would be unpleasant to walk on in the dark even with flashlights so after sunset you need to walk quickly back before dark. View was nice but it is hard to beat the views from the resort\u2022Hike to Blue Pearl Bay and snorkeling. We borrowed snorkeling gear from the marina and headed off self walked on this 3 km hike over a rocky trail. The halfway point is the Whitsunday Lookout. Unfortunately the tide was out and entry into the water was over sharp corals. The guided walk was scheduled to leave early in the morning to coordinate arrival with high tide. At low tide the water was very shallow so you had to swim way out to get to comfortable snorkeling depth. Visibility was limited due to shallow waters and silty bottom. Ultimately only one of us actually snorkeled and he reported that it was good but not fantastic. We could see people snorkeling off a boat in deeper water in Blue Pearl Bay 2. That was probably a little better for snorkeling but we enjoyed the hike. We saw plenty of wallabies through the bushes on our walk and had a nice chat. Take plenty of water for the walk back\u2022Jet skiing water skiing wake boarding. We booked in advance for 2 hours of wake boarding water sking but on the day the sea was too rough and these were cancelled. We opted for jet skiing instead. We were first time jet skiers. We rented two jet skis. Drivers must be over 16. Our 18 yr old drove one and dad drove the other with 13 yr old on back. Mom opted out. 13 yr old on back HATED it. Cold wet out of control and hanging on for dear life. 18 yr old driver LOVED it. She was in control. Conclusion driving good riding on back not so much. Very easy to learn to drive. Seas were rough but guide assumed drivers were in it for the speed the bumps and the adventure. Drivers were passenger was not\u2022Best of both Worlds Helicopter Excursion. A major splurge for our family of four since each helicopter takes only 3 passengers. so we needed to rent two helicopters. But the best thing we did on our familys trip to Australia. So glad the weather was nice that day or the trip could have been cancelled. We took the afternoon excursion 1PM start and flew first to Whitehaven Beach. The pilots talk throughout and point out interesting things visible from the air. One of ours spotted two manta rays in a shallow cove. We landed on Whitehaven beach and stayed there for about 45 minutes sipping champagne and wading in the water just enjoying the gorgeous white sand beach. Then we took off for a helicopter tour of the reef. I took so many photos of the reef from the helicopter. Just dazzling. The pilots took two circles over heart reef and then landed on a pontoon near Reef World. We arrived just as the day boat departed and met up with another helicopter group of two for snorkeling. The six of us had the entire reef off of Reef World to ourselves to enjoy for an hour or so. Crystal clear water and loaded with corals and fishes. Then we flew back to Hayman Island over open water. The day was an amazing bucket list experience totally worth them money. UNEXPECTED DELIGHTS\u2022Cockatos.

This review is a bit delayed but here are just some of my thoughts that may help those deciding between Hayman Qualia. We stayed over the Valentines Day weekend in February this year. We flew into Hamilton Island and took the yatch transfer over. The cruise over was great the captain pointed out various points of interests along the way and we were served canap\u00e9s and champagne. We stayed in the Beach Villa No1. It is located very close to reception and halfway between the Hayman pool and the Aquazure pool. The villa is beautifully designed and has a really nice relaxed luxurious feel. There are floor to ceiling glass doors around the whole villa allowing direct sunlight into it making it nice and bright. The only issue for us was that because it was on the beach the villa itself lacked any privacy. If we left the blinds up to enjoy the beach front views then everyone that walks past can see straight into our bedroom. We felt this was the major downfall to an otherwise perfect room which is why we gave it a 4 star rating. Despite the renovations walking around to the Hayman wing we felt not much had been done to the exterior of the buildings and so it felt outdated and out of place. but that is just us being nit picky. Service was very good and consistent and we were assigned our own butler which is a nice touch. Our butler was very helpful friendly and very enthusiastic. It is definitely refreshing to see an Australian resort getting on par with the rest of the world. Food here does not disappoint we ate at The Fire restaurant twice during our stay and were impressed both times. Breakfast is also really good with a great selection of food to choose from something not many hotels do very well but Hayman nailed it. We had a couples massage which was really good we were able to pick our own music which I thought was something different. In terms of the layout and design of the spa I was quite disappointed. it is just located in a building and does not have that zen relaxed stepped into another world feel like at Qualia. The Hayman boutique is worth visiting for those wanting to shop it stocks a lot of cool designers both Australian and International we were happy to find quite a few goodies. For those wanting to know which is better Qualia or Hayman it really comes down to personal preference and what you are after in a holiday. I found them quite different and so one is not better than the other. In terms of service I think both are pretty on par. Based on my experience I would return to Hayman if and when I have kids I think it is a great place for a family holiday but for a rejuvenating couples getaway my preference is still Qualia.", "offset": [861, 981], "date": "2015-08-25", "cpt": "2", "category": "beach"}, {"id": 17, "uid": "9f01c50f-5792-42ce-af24-6131a9980692", "sentence": "Swimming with Turtles on Langford Island.

I wonder if they need to better target their offering. As it is currently it might be better suited to older less travelled guests and parents with children. If you have travelled elsewhere in the world or even within Australia and stayed in 5 star hotels or even boutique luxury accommodation you will be disappointed. If you are a foodie do not bother staying unles they are hosting a guest chef. The food was at best average. Small surprises like an amuse bouche one night and a starter in the Asian restaurant Bamboo but nothing I will remember in the weeks or months to come. We spent a day on Langford Island which was beautiful but the picnic we ordered to take with us did not have any cutlery making the salads and other items impossible to eat. Everyone else on trip advisor seems to have been impressed with the buffet breakfast I am going to break that mould and say again it was at best average. I am sorry but you can not serve hash browns that look like they have come from the frozen section of the supermarket and call yourself 5 star. While there is an omelette station when I asked for two freshly cooked poached eggs I was pointed to the watery bain marie with three sad looking eggs that I am sure had been there since the breakfast started 2 hours earlier. There were frequently no bowls for muesli or fruit a number of the pastry items were put back in the fridge only to return the next morning stale and inedible. The seafood buffet was also nothing spectacular. This should have been the jewel in the resorts crown. No oysters no fresh scallops no coral trout despite seeing 100s in the water while snorkeling. etc etc. The fish on offer salmon and barramundi was dry and unappetizing. The matching wine buffet while expensive was very good and the sommelier seemed to know what he was talking about. The best thing about the food scene right now in Australia and the rest of the world for that matter is the focus on locally sourced produce. The Whitsundays is perfectly located to make the most of this but again this resort fails on that front. The resort has a captive audience each night and yet there is nothing special on offer. No cocktail bar on the beach or after dinner drinks by the pool. special little offerings that may have resurrected the experience. The big wood fired lanterns that sat on the beach each day remained unlit as did my excitement for this resort. The day spa is also average. A few key services such at the Bastion hand and foot treatments and their signature massages are amazing however standard treatments are just that standard. After a 60min minute facial I was left unimpressed. Again if they kept to a few key treatments and did them well the experience would be better. The more you are disappointed the more you notice where improvements could be made. For example the pool and beach towels were old and tattered the picnic baskets beach chairs and umbrellas were poor quality and looked cheap there were candles in lanterns all over the resort that in the 5 nights we stayed were never lit the interior of restaurants and rooms had dust dirt and cobwebs that were never cleaned glassware in some restaurants and on the yacht transfer were poor quality staff uniforms were tired and the fabrics not suited to the climate the marina is tired and needs renovating. I did feel that the arrivals and departures via helicopter and yacht transfer were impressive. The natural beauty of the location is second to none and was really what made this trip for us. Snorkeling at Blue Pearl Bay and Langford Island swimming with turtles just off the main beach of the resort. These experiences I will remember forever. We will not be returning and will be unlikely to recommend to our family and friends. For the same spend there are other options with an offering that is perfect.", "offset": [3153, 3662], "date": "2016-10-11", "cpt": "2", "category": "beach"}, {"id": 20, "uid": "f36cf975-5d1d-414b-abae-7e8d47b06dba", "sentence": "Amazing location with ok service. Loved the location and natural beauty can not be beat. But for the price would have expected better service. do not expect Ritz Carlton or Park Hyat level of service and you be fine. An example they do not have a single person working the beach chairs etc to take ur order. You have to walk to pool area quite s ways to order. Would expect something better when it is over a 1000 night when all said and done. Activities were amazing and loved the Asian restaurant Location. Alex and mario st the activities center for snorkeling. They were amazing. Scuba snorkeling hiking sunsets. Needs more staffing so better service can be provided eg service staff for beach chairs.", "offset": [217, 307], "date": "2016-11-04", "cpt": "2", "category": "beach"}, {"id": 21, "uid": "20a9325a-fbb2-4c6d-94dc-c7074a128215", "sentence": "Gorgeous Location but not perfect. I will start by saying that I have never stayed in a resort this expensive and so I had high expectations. I chose to stay there because I wanted to be able to snorkel near the Great Barrier Reef without having to go in a boat seasick easily. The website indicates you can walk 3 km to a cove to snorkel. What the website does not say clearly is that the trail is very rocky and uphill and takes at least an hour if not more. So it will be hard for many people to hike there with snorkel gear. You can sign up for a 2 hour boat trip to snorkel sadly there is no shuttle service to the snorkel spot you have to sign up in advance for a tour. The pools are beautiful and look just like the pictures. As someone else said I was disappointed with the snacks on the boat trip to the property. The website talks about a luxury yacht trip with champagne abc snacks. The snacks were bread sticks olives nuts and dip. It was not much considering it was lunch time. Two of the three dinner restaurants are not airconditioned and we found them hot about 82. We ate outside by the pool or persuaded the Pacific restaurant to let us eat on their deck. They really preferred we eat inside. Some of the activities only run a couple days a week which is frustrating. I asked for a large map of the property but there were not any. In general the staff was very accommodating. They brought water and popsicles to the beach. The non motorized beach activities are free but are only available at high tide. That info is not really shared until you get there. Some day when we thought we had sail in the morning we could not. Our room was as described. The property was only 12 full so no problem getting beach chairs or scheduling trips. Meals were very expensive but we knew that in advance.", "offset": [1442, 1522], "date": "2017-02-03", "cpt": "2", "category": "beach"}, {"id": 22, "uid": "c57ce18e-9425-4ac6-99e6-13609cdd6467", "sentence": "Disapointing. Our sixth visit and more than likely our last. Since our last visit in late 2015 Hayman is in need of a lot of TLC and a Management with an eye for detail who can get things done and liaise with guests. The trip over on their new cat 420 return p was nice but the canap\u00e9s they serve homus water crackers olives and nuts per table on board and O O brand pink bubbles were disappointing. Not a good first impression when you are thinking is this going to be the style of their five star service. Why can not they still serve the lovely canap\u00e9s that they do at the GMS cocktail party and Perier Jouet bubbles on every other trip we have taken. Staff are very friendly and helpful but need more training to get things right first off. Like not waiting 34 of an hour and three phone calls for a bucket of ice. The first three days we were there the newer area. pools had a lot of leaves and sand in them. The overflow from the infinity edge was green with moss. They only started cleaning them when my husband mentioned this to one of the Managers. The next morning the pool cleaner was in the pools for 1 12 days with guests doing his job. This should be done at the end of the day or early in the morning before the arrival of guests to the pool areas. The original pool also needed a clean and in difference areas the pool liner was lifting up. Not 5 star. The grounds look tired. A good going over with a gurney would make a huge difference to the sandstone in all areas and clearing out of the ponds and garden of dead vegetation would make it sparkle. Rooms are clean but the mattress in our room needs replacing way way too soft that you sag into the middle. New soft towels would be an added bonus. Restaurants are very expensive. 25. a cocktail. The cheapest of wine is just under 100. a bottle. Bottles of spirits four times what you pay in a liquor shop. Moet 175 a bottle. The food in all restaurants is average at it is best. Nothing outstanding to make a dinner memorable. Even the seafood buffet 125 p. food only really surf turf needed a lot more imagination but into it. Breakfast has a good selection to choose from but a change of items from time to time would be good. Excursions are hugely expensive. Check them out on their web site. All in all the staff made it a memorable long awaited family holiday and made things easy for my expectant daughter and our two year old grandson. With all the new planned building and resorts refurbishments in the Whitsundays One and Only really need to up their game if they want to keep that 5 star branding.", "offset": [870, 913], "date": "2017-03-04", "cpt": "2", "category": "beach"}]}
