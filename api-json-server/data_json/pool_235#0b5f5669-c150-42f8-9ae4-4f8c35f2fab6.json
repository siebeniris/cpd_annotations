It is hardwired in our psychology to make stronger memories of negative experiences so we can avoid them in the future. So good and happy times all blend into an indistinct continuum while bad times are often never forgotten. Similarly twenty good reviews can be negated by one bad one. This tendency can be exploited by those with an agenda or reinforced by those who are unreasonably demanding. Bad reviews should be read with this in mind. That said I had intended to start off with my negative experiences while spending a week at Turnbery for a combo of business and vacation. We had absolutely none. Our day of both arrival and departure changed multiple times due to winter weather. Turnbery was completely accommodating with all the changes. I arrived by myself at 10 am and expected to wait all day for a room. Lovely Stephanie at registration welcomed me and told me she would do her best move me in immediately. It took some time for her to search but she succeeded and next thing I was being led through a beautifully landscaped terrace and into Hibiscus. Our room was very spacious with a large and very comfortable king bed and a balcony overlooking the Cascata pool and fountain. This balcony was a lovely sunny place to sit and watch the sunset. The Cascata pool is for adults and is very peaceful. The bathroom was all marble and mosaic tile with a huge tub and separate shower soft robes and slippers and Moulton Brown toiletries. The toilet was in its own room with a phone. A small minibar allowed some room for our own items to be refrigerated. There is a much larger pool for families at the other side of the resort. This pool is understandably much louder and had live music two of the days we were there. Riding in a tube on the lazy river enjoying a mojito and listening to a steel drum band is a very fun way to spend some time. There was a large jacuzi with strong jets and a very fun waterslide too. There were many chaises and cabanas to be had but they tended to fill quickly. The attendants are very accommodating in finding you a spot and setting you up with a chaise liner towels and umbrellas if you need them. We were at the adult pool most of the time and the attendant there Juan Pablo is a treasure. I watched him from my balcony from early morning until late evening working very hard. He always found us seats in our favourite area and I witnessed him dealing with some very demanding guests with grace and a smile. He always did his best to please. Turnbery you are lucky to have him. We also hopped the shuttle to the beach. This was a quick ride and the beach club has a restaurant cabanas hammocks a good sized pool and a game area. Jean set us up on the beach and brought lunch in a bento box. He was very attentive and pleasant. The beach club is on a lovely wide sandy area with no highrises to shadow in the afternoon it so the sun shines very late. Once you are settled there you will not want to leave the azure ocean. Aventura mall is right across the street from the hotel and you can shuttle there too but why go to a mall with such a beautiful resort to enjoy. The spa and fitness center were very luxurious. On day one I went in to book a massage and saw that they had many fitness classes so I bought a package of 6. Next day I went back for a pilates class to learn that a lot of the classes were for members only. So I asked for a refund for my classes and used the state of the art equipment and 4 mile jogging trail around the resort instead. No problem except on checkout the charge was still there. I went to the spa and they apologised most graciously and removed the charge. I had a wonderful massage with Nely. I wanted a deep tissue myofascial release sports massage and she delivered. Breakfast buffet at Corsair was very good but too much food for me. I was happy with fruit yoghourt and baked goods with a latte from the lobby coffee shop eaten out by the fountain in the sun. I have never had a multigrain seeded croissant before. We ate at Corsair three times which we enjoyed very much. Their Valentines prix fix dinner was good value and the food was top notch. Still dreaming about the Burata with winter veg and hazelnuts and the shortrib agnoloti with horseradish agliata. We tried Bourbon Steak and it was very crowded and noisy not at all as fresh and creative but much more expensive. Steak lovers will be in heaven. The bar there however is a lovely place to have a craft cocktail or after dinner drink. The selection of libations is very high standard. The food at the two pools and the beach was good but was the same in all three places. This is my only complaint as the menu was limited and got boring pretty quickly. It seems it would not be too difficult to give each location its own individually tweaked menu so that each place is a unique lunch destination. Keep the same menu at Laguna for families at Cascata add some adult sophistication or ethnic influences or even open up some of Corsairs lunch menu to polside and make beach fare more Floribean. Finally my memory fails me in remembering all the wonderful people who went out of their way to help me anytime I seemed to be in need. One young man took it upon himself to locate the stairs in the Hibiscus building as I could not find them and he did not know. A very pleasant blond lady went out of her way to furnish me with a shuttle schedule when she saw me standing uncertainly out front. Everyone I passed smiled and asked what they could do or wished me a good day. I had no bad indifferent or negative service. We had a very relaxing time at this wonderful hotel and I will most readily return.", "offset": [1282, 1334], "date": "2015-02-18", "cpt": "0", "category": "pool"}, {"id": 2, "uid": "ff572667-d609-4d41-b730-4d58376a76b9", "sentence": "Taking a Turn at Turnbery.

My family and I checked in Memorial Day weekend May 26 27 2019. As we arrived valet was backed up a bit however this is understandable as it is a very busy weekend. We were greeted by a very friendly valet attendant who guided us to the check in desk inside. The lobby is nice well lit clean and the decor is very nice. My family waited on the comfy couches while I checked in. I had the pleasure of being checked in by Michele who was amazing. Michele assisted me with the two reservations I had explained the property grounds. She advised me that my rooms were not ready and asked for my contact number so I can be reached when they were ready. Michele offered to store our bags and provided me our Tidal Cove bands to start enjoying the grounds. The walk is very easy to the Tidal Cove area when you arrive you need to go through a checkpoint and then find an attendant who will help you find lounge chairs. I was very lucky to find Lucas who was extremely helpful. The pool area was packed but he was able to find us three lounge chairs near the water slides which was perfect. Lucas also found us an umbrella so we would not get direct sunlight. Throughout the day when Lucas walked by he would ask me if everything is good and if we needed anything. What amazing service. Our server was Kevin who did not skip a beat with checking up on us and bringing us food and drinks. Although he was very busy running around he always stopped to check in and see if we needed anything. We spent the entire day until 6 pm enjoying Tidal Cove. The slides lazy river and pool were amazing. Our kids and friends had a wonderful time. I especially enjoyed the two different DJs located at the main pool which was playing some great music on Sunday and Monday. Once we left the Cove we went up to our rooms to get ready for dinner. Our room was spacious and we had a great view of Tidal Cove. We were located on the 11th floor. The bathroom was well lit and spacious as well. The room truly felt comfortable and decorated lovely. The beds were very comfortable as well which is why we slept in until 1030 am the next day. Sunday morning I went down to the Starbucks which i located near valet to get breakfast for the kids wife and I Great move on having a Starbucks on site. After breakfast we all headed back to Tidal Cove to enjoy sometime prior to departing. I had the pleasure of meeting Claudine Basile near the pool Claudine had assisted me via email with some requests and she was amazing as well. Claudine enhanced our wonderful experience at the JW. I want to also praise Chris I believe he is the Assistance Director of Tidal Cove. Chris was wonderful in solving a small issue we had regarding another guest who was holding 12 lounge chairs but her family was not at the pool. Long story short Chris showed leadership and great customer service in assisting my family and friends in finding a new location.

We decided to stay at this propert a couple of days prior to going on a cruise. My wife and I travel extensiviely and know the Mariot brand well Titanium AmbasadorThis property was simply fantastic from start to finish. Comments are. Check in was amongst the best I have ever experienced at a Mariot. Upon arrival we were met by Fabi provide chmpagne and had a private check in experience. I can not say enough how this set the tone for the entire stay. We were give a room in the new building request the new building if booking with a view of the golf courses and the ocean in the distance. Beautiful. The entire property was very inviting. We especially enjoyed the outdoor hallways felt like some resorts we have stayed at in Mexico. The attached waterpark was enjoyable. We especially enjoyed the Lazy River lagoon pool and hot tubs. On site breakfast met all of our expectations and was the typical Mariot buffet. Very god Extensive food and retail surround this hotel. We were able to take a free shuttle or take a short drive to access all of the surrounding businesses. We had dinner at a wood fired pizza location 80 degree pizza was the name I think. which was very good. Overall we were both very please with our stay here. In an urban area but it did not feel that way on the property. We will return for another visit here in the future.", "offset": [792, 854], "date": "2020-01-27", "cpt": "3", "category": "pool"}, {"id": 25, "uid": "176cc316-6af8-4872-a299-c95bad684219", "sentence": "Large rooms with lovely decor.
