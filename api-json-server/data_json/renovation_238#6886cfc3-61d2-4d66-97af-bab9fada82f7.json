This was a return trip for us over the holidays. The beach and pool areas at this hotel are fabulous. The location on the island makes it easy to walk to some restaurants and grocery stores and shopping are a short car ride down Collier. We are Platinum Elite Mariot members and used a significant number of points for this stay. Our room had a partial ocean and pool view which was nice but the room itself was extremely worn and torn. Once we settled in and spent one night we provided a list of items to the front desk requiring attention. The shower drain was clogged and you stood in dirty water for the duration of your shower. The TV remote control did not work. The in room safe was showing an error code and could not be accessed. The plastic shower liner was filthy yellowed and sticky. For a resort we found this level of basic maintenance issues to be very disappointing. When we raised these issues they were addressed immediately and professionally. However routine maintenance and room reviews should be part of the overall plan at this hotel. It appeared that the toilet had recently been replaced. However the tank lid did not fit the tank. The result was gouges in the drywall in the bathroom. Room cleaning was hit or miss. We had to call twice to request service. All rooms should be cleaned by 430pm based on the info displayed in the room. That did not happen twice despite our room being unoccupied and the privacy sign removed. There is a lot of room for improvement here. Our mattress was hard and firm and I do not recall that being an issue during our last stay. It proved to be very uncomfortable as the week wore on. The restaurants are ridiculously high priced but we knew that going in and made sure to spend our time at local eateries so as not to get gouged. Having a small fridge in the room also helps with snacks. If we return to Marco Island we will likely explore another hotel in the area despite the great beach and pools at the Mariot.", "offset": [842, 928], "date": "2016-01-08", "cpt": "0", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 3, "uid": "a896b0cc-5978-430f-be4a-760d9e629f1e", "sentence": "Very nice stay large resort and good location. We stayed here on a vacation as a couple for three nights four days. After reading all the reviews and seeing that this was the best resort to stay at on Marco I think our expectations were very high. The resort was very clean lots of things to do and the staff was very friendly. However those were the only things we really enjoyed about the hotel. We felt this was just an average resort due to the price restaurant options and quality. Rooms construction We upgraded and paid for the pool Gulf view room and ended up in a room on the 6th floor of the Island tower. This was an upgraded room. Our first room was on floor three of the Palms tower not updated. We understand we were not paying for a full Gulf view but when we opened the curtains to see the balcony we were looking out onto a large rooftop of what sounded like the place where they kept all the air conditions for the entire resort. Yes if you leaned over the balcony you could see a glimpse of the Gulf so they get to charge the extra price. but it was just extremely disappointing. Once we trekked back downstairs to the front desk with our belongings they switched our room. Being 6 months pregnant this was not fun for me. The room we ended up in was extremely dusty. There was dust over the bathroom and bedside table. Also the construction noise wake up call before 9 am was not my favorite either. We were told the noise would not start until 10 am the next day Saturday. but it did start much earlier. Parking. We were glad we did the self park option across the street as it was 10 cheaper and easy to access at any time. Fees. Beware of the 4 different taxes applied per night as well at the 25 resort fee. The resort fee does get you lots of amenities. internet access water replenished access to the practice fold facility 2 spa fitness classes beach umbrella and BOGO adult breakfast at Maia. Some of these I feel should be included especially with a high room fee. Food Most nights we ate outside of the resort as none of the food on the menus really appeal to us. We did eat breakfast at Maia and lunch at Pazis. Both were good options but the only places we really wanted to try. Overall the experience was average.

I have been excited to take my kids 3 and 8 here planned this trip months ago but the Mariot is not up to par. I am picky about hotels and vacations because well let us face it time is precious and they usually cost thousands of dollars. We stayed for six nights for roughly 50. The beach is beautiful and all of the staff are friendly and helpful. The main entrance and lobby are in need up update very 1970s. The entrance valet is overcrowded and understaffed. The valets all hustle but it can take a long time to get your car at peak times like dinner. Definitely call from your room before you head downstairs to request your car. The rooms are ok but not great. The bed and pillows are not of good quality at all but the TV is nice. The bathrooms are great obviously recently renovated. My kids and I were put in a room next to the elevator so we heard that going up and down all night and were awoken at 7 am our first morning by a mom screaming obscenities at her son because he refused to get on the elevator. I talked to the front desk lady about this and she was very kind offered to move us but alas they were fully booked. Definitely ask for a room away from the elevator. The wifi in the room is TERRIBLE. Do not bother coming here if you plan on using your device. I called tech support several times and they pushed through our devices. This worked fine during low traffic times but when lots of people are presumably on line in the morning and evening you can not get on. Very frustrating. And they charge for it. The TV is not a very good alternative they offer the least amount of channels I have ever seen in a hotel and ONE kid one a teen one at that. Nancy the head valet in the mornings is a wealth of knowledge of local attractions. There are a couple of good kid activities the animal show was a good one and bungee jumping on the beach. The food at Quins and Pazis the only two property places we ate are ok but can take a long time to get to your table. Not conducive to travel with kids. We ended up going off property most of the time. The coffee shop in the lobby is quite good. There are two pools which are okay but in the shade much of the day because of the towers on either side.

Purpose of stay Overseas family holiday resort with twin toddles taken late August 2017 to enjoy beach pool and surrounding area. Dislikes first Hotel Restaurant Maia buffet breakfast bill. Final hotel restaurant Visa charge was 10 higher than what I originally signed for due to a fiddle with the gratuity line. Listed Buffet breakfast cost is 30 p adult but the18 service charge tip is obligatory at time of payment therefore the list price is misleading. In principle Mariot is lying to the customer. Unsure why one needs to pay 18 service tip at a buffet self service. Pool area Pool rules clearly state no food or drink inside pool area yet this is clearly overlooked by the amount of people drinking eating inside the pool. The Pool Monitors at the towel dispensing kiosk dismissed the situation as an issue when queriedit is noticeable Mariot allows non hotel guests to use the pool facilities for a nominal fee. Housekeeping hours run from 090 until 1630 and sometimes twice in four days. they knocked on the door for cleaning well after 17hr when you are having an afternoon siesta. Resort fee is 30 p day on top of room cost up to individual to determine if that cost is reasonable. Our family did not see the value but maybe that is because the services included are geared towards adults. Likes Location is spot on if you want a 4 resort on a decent white shelled beach with warm bathing sea. Hotel maintenance keeps the sand in front of the resort well groomed. On premise Ice Cream Parlour served frozen yoghurt and was a big hit at a reasonable price. One of the two pools included a children area water slide park and this was a crowd pleaser. Rooms we had room 708 and the size was generous with large contemporary bathroom and nice terrace with splendid unobstructed beach sea views overlooking pool. Beds were medium hard and slept well. Linen towels and toiletries were above standard. Front Reception and Concierge were pleasant and professional. Despite the 10 unaproved charge uplift the buffet breakfast was delicious with plenty on offer. Hotel parking is across street from resort with security. 15 p day. Plenty of spots to park. Overall we enjoyed our stay and as a loyal Mariot member I will continue to use Mariot but I shal not return to this property due to the final unaproved restaurant line cost even if its the principle. I appreciate Mariots vision is to ensure positive customer experience and in my opinion they tick many boxes with this resort however if they were to remodel their buffet breakfast cost structure they may find more guests stay on premise to eat than dine outside. Simply put a family of four with 2 5 year olds has a minimum daily breakfast bill of 75 including obligatory tip and over a weeks stay that is a significant outlay especially when 5 year olds eat very little.", "offset": [2382, 2645], "date": "2017-09-03", "cpt": "1", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 12, "uid": "6a797d40-1f37-41bd-b594-d902616e88b0", "sentence": "Great Experience at the JW Mariot Marco. My family and I have been to the resort when it was a Mariot and always enjoyed it. But Mariot has stepped up its game now that it is a JW. We went over the New Year holiday and stayed over 10 days. The service was always very good in the past but I must say the personal that are up front at check in do a great job. When I checked in I did have a problem with my reservation. However the front desk manager Caitlyn Baughman went the extra mile and provided the excellent service one would expect at a JW property. She was professional courteous and caring in handling my situation and making sure that my problem was solved. Over the days that I stayed there I noticed her doing the same for a lot of guests. She greeted guests that had an issue with a smile and continued to provide the excellent service under a few times difficult situations. Caitlyn is definitely representative of what you want a JW Manager to be like. She goes the extra mile and does a great job in providing excellent service. Very impressive. And I must say the rest of the front desk staff were also always pleasant and smiling when greeting guests whenever we were up front. The bell man and up front personal for cars and baggage were very helpful to us especially Dan Hagerty who has been there a number of years. I do stay at JWs for business and this is one of the best I have stayed at in recent times. And while the old Mariot staff delivered service at a high level I think the upgrade to being a JW is noticeable. Construction was going on during our stay but it really had minimal impact with noise while we where there. The beach area staff were great as always. I also noticed the pool staff doing a much better job with people that would put towels down and leave for a few hours. While it was crowded and chairs were being saved the staff did try to make sure that if towels were left unattended for over an hour that they would clear them. And they were always pleasant. It was not perfect but I definitely appreciated the effort they put in and I never really had a problem in getting chairs if we decided not to go to the beach because it was to busy. I feel the the restaurants on the property are very well run and we really enjoyed the Quins grill on the beach. My family ordered there almost everyday for lunch. The fish tacos were great. They also enjoyed the tiki bar and Pazis pizza and their unlimited soda and water drinks if you buy their cup. It was a great value for the days we were there. The rooms in the two towers were all renovated in the JW style. I think they are really nice and comfortable. One other area I will discuss was the Spa. My wife and I were fortunate enough to meet the Spa director Paul Nunez. They have upgraded it and Paul and his staff are doing a wonderful job. Again when you go in you are greeted professionally and always with a smile and with care. Nothing is pushed on you. We enjoyed the facilities they have a great mineral pool and decided to both just get a basic massage. I have to say it was the best massage we ever had. Paul said he had a great staff and with him as the Director I can see why. He does a great job. I would definitely recommend the Spa for a day when you visit. And ask to meet Paul. You will not be disappointed. Again just an overall great experience for me and my family. And we look forward to the summer when the renovation on the new adult section will be completed.
