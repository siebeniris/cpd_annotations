I could not recomend the hotel highly enough. i stayed here for 3 nights. I traveled all the way from Australia for an event that was in Santa Clara. This was a last option booking for myself but I am glad I booked this hotel. Matt at the front desk was outstanding. No question or request was too much for him to assist with. Even with some silly questions I asked. In saying that though all the staff were friendly professional and nothing was too much trouble for them. The room was spacious modern and the bed was very comfortable. You could choose your sleep number setting. I went for breakfast on the Sunday. unfortunately due to personal reasons of the chef there was no hot food available however to compensate for that the breakfast was free. cereal juice tea coffee. and it was more than enough for me. I ordered room service and it arrived quickly and it was very nice. If I ever come back to the silicon valley I will definitely stay here again.

My wife and I had a good memory of the Domain Hotel from having gone to the Potlatch science fiction conference there a few years ago. The hotel has some things to recommend it. it is attractive especially in the public spaces. The location on El Camino Real at the Sunyvale Santa Clara line is close to a lot of employers and a lot of restaurants. Parking is easy if you want it there is a frequent bus line on El Camino as welBut this time my wife and I were really put off by the hotels attitude when we checked in. The first room we saw had a broken heating cooling unit. We changed to another room where the shade was broken. There are blinds but the room faces onto El Camino a very busy multi lane road with lots of light even at night. When we asked the hotel sent someone who informed us that yes the shade was broken no they could not do anything about it. that is not how things should operate. They shifted us to a third room where everything worked. When we came back to the desk after the first room my wife saw an interaction which she believes was the manager on duty directing the clerk not to give us a better room. The hotel did give us free breakfasts. This was nice though it was a very mediocre hot breakfast and definitely would not have been worth the 1495 the hotel normally changes. The much friendlier check out clerk also gave us a modest discount on our room rate which was also nice. But there are a great many hotels and motels in Silicon Valley and if we stay down there again we had go somewhere else.", "offset": [43, 177], "date": "2016-02-28", "cpt": "0", "category": "venue"}, {"id": 2, "uid": "f5b3ae92-0672-4104-b8d8-bb1e1174d8ce", "sentence": "A Small Silicon Valley Hotel with Atmosphere.

January business visit from the UK for 4 nights. Interesting setup with an open central atrium and a walk up bar near the main external doors.

Breakfast was OK but repetitive and fruit often ran out not to be replenished during my time in the room even after being requested. Bar food small plates were quite good but bar hours were odd and on one night it closed at 11 pm despite a decent crowd ready to spend some more.

I want to love this place the style and detail on the main atrium are just delightful. Alas at the end of the day you must stay in a room and the rooms here are increasingly mediocre. There are still hints of style and flair but the sink is cracked the shower takes 10 minutes to get hot there is no bathmat and for rooms facing the atrium there are only thin blinds covering a huge window that opens to said brightly lit atrium so it is utterly impossible to make the room actually be dark at night. Some curtains would help. A lot. Two new features were interesting. there is a wine dispenser which works as advertised with exactly two flavors of mid grade wine. And they have put in sleep number beds which in my opinion are a gadget that would better be replaced by a regular high quality mattress such as you would find at any local Mariot Hilton etc. I admire the style but I need a dark room with a decent sink and shower. do not get distracted from the boring functional details they matter too.", "offset": [0, 55], "date": "2018-10-17", "cpt": "0", "category": "venue"}, {"id": 10, "uid": "1eb4b00b-e19e-41a2-b3ae-ae67182226fa", "sentence": "Mediocre rooms and services with odd touches. We last stayed here a number of years ago when they were owned by a different group. This time I was disappointed by the lack of services and general run down feel of the room. The bar restaurant and room service were all closed for the holidays. Although it was 9 pm on Satureday Dec 22 we were hungry and ended up walking to KFC for food. Also the room was odd. I recalled they were a little odd from the last trip and was reminded of that. There was a window to the atrium with bright lights coming in all night I found the light blocking shade the next morning. There was an odd wine serving contraption that might have been cool but it was empty and opened. Also the sleep number bed while something we enjoy at home is not one of the better ones. You can set your firmness level but there is no comfort or cushioning layer. The sheets and very thin covering also left a bit to be desired in the comfort department. The room also had a definite mildewy odor or maybe a sort of sewage odor. And what I had thought was cool tech touches 5 7 years ago is now pretty obsolete. Now the big screen modern TV was an upside especially for husband but for me did not make up for the negatives. In summary I get the hotel trying to save money by closing its bar and restaurant but that would have been nice to know in advance or how about a credit for that.
