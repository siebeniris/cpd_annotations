We have been to Dubai a few times but wanted to try a new location. We had a beautiful room a moderate suite with separate living and bedroom areas and two baths with two large balconies overlooking the pool and beach area. The lobby area the spa the hotel property overall is gorgeous. Great attention was paid to architecture and decor. If design is important to you this hotel will not disappoint. Our room was generous in size with walk in closets and perfectly appointed bathrooms. Because the property is new you will enjoy not only the stunning decor but small touches like in wall plug adapters for various countries the latest electronics contemporary lighting and other convenience features such as electronic drapes etc. The staff was for the most part very professional friendly and accommodating and in time I think this will be one of the best choices in Dubai. We experienced a few glitches mostly due to the lack of training for staff or just the newness of the property surely these things will get addressed in the coming months. Things to consider. The two pools one quiet and one for kids or louder activities are wonderful. Really beautiful surroundings for a Dubai location. We loved hanging out at the pools with the palms and flowers cascading all around. Great chairs wonderful set ups and good service at the pools. However if you are looking for the best beach location this Four Seasons may not be the place for you. The actual beach area at the hotel is very nice but small. The views presently to the left and right include construction walls or other construction obstructions that detract from the overall feel of the beach. Also if you are looking for great food options this hotel will be limiting for you. The food quality was fine there just are not really any exciting options for dining. If we saw a big gap in service this is where we noticed it the most in the dining areas. The hostesses were often uninviting upon arrival and then several of the servers in the restaurants were not up to par for a five star resort. We waited for long periods with no service were served the wrong food we were given checks before we finished eating then alternately could not find anyone for service. servers gave us incorrect information about options served our food to others and then attempted to put the same dish on our table after it sat on the wrong table etc. Just lack of training and supervision I believe but worth noting. Especially as food service often involves food safety and also because Dubai has some of the BEST food in the world. so I have to trust that the Four Seasons will bring this up to par for this property quite soon. I think the breakfast buffet was nice enough in the main hotel restaurant and we looked forward to seating on the patio each morning. It was very much a buffet experience however and so anything beyond lunch there seemed less desirable. Pool side lunches proved to be a good alternative for us. Fortunately it is easy to go out and enjoy the many fantastic restaurant alternatives in Dubai. For all the foodies out there just noting that we did not find the Four Seasons to be outstanding in this department during its initial opening period. If activities or outside excursions are important for you be sure to do your homework before you leave for Dubai and make arrangements early to avoid missing out. Things are often filled up even before you arrive. While we found the concierge desk to be very professional and helpful a few of the junior staff members were not as knowledgeable as the others that were truly exceptional and you would not want to leave your details to chance. Things we recommend 1. See the Desert Desert Jeep 4x4 Tours with Dinner super exciting if you opt for the more aggressive dune driving tours or nice if you just go for the more leisurely tour and have dinner at the desert camp with belly dancing and short camel rides under the stars included. Not so impressed with the falcon option so do not worry about skipping that part. Absolutely take the more extreme driving tours if your group would enjoy that type of activity. We have done both and enjoyed each for different reasons. Just note here is a BIG difference in the company you take and the option you chose so clarify and ask for the one the suits you best. If I went again I would try to take the least full or smaller company I would take the more thrilling extreme driving option neither is truly extreme and I would try to be the first or last vehicle in line. I would spend a few dollars more and also opt for a private car for sure otherwise you could be assigned a 4x4 with others if you are only two or three for your group. Good excursion for adults or kids. The photos on the dunes are great be sure to take your camera. If you do not take a 4x4 tour then maybe check out the sand surfing wildlife tours camel rides etc. BUT be sure to head out to the dunes. 2. Ski Dubai and Penguin Encounter. I thought this would be horrible or so touristic that I would not enjoy it but we all loved the experience of skiing within a mall and hanging out with the penguins. Mainly for kids I suppose but our adults applauded by surprise. The snow is better than you would expect the run is longer than we thought it could be and we all said it was a totally fun short adventure3. Atlantis Day Pass with Dolphin Adventure. I would never opt to stay at Atlantis Dubai after experiencing that property in the Bahamas for the sake of my kids one too many times. but we all did enjoy going over to the Atlantis Dubai for an afternoon with the Dolphin programs. Excellent marine staff there and a different dolphin encounter than we did in the Bahamas. Great adventure for families with kids. 4. Helicopter Over Dubai5. Burj Kahlifa Dubai Mall Fountain Show People watching shopping coffee etc6. Restaurants Burj Kahlifa and Armani Hotel. All have great atmosphere wonderful food and views7. Shows and touring artists Check out the schedule as Dubai has many exciting performers and shows booked at various times.", "offset": [1560, 1618], "date": "2015-01-05", "cpt": "0", "category": "beach"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "1baf48a5-b598-44cb-a4fc-c60b911c8871", "sentence": "Very good in time will be even better. I understand that my review will be regarded as not a very objective one in a way that there are not many people in the hotel yet and therefore the service provided can feel a little overwhelming. However the hotel staff that provide that service are so friendly that even if you were in a bad mood you would feel ashamed and a little embarrassed. The hotel itself is beautiful it does not have a typical arabic grandeur that some are used to in certain Dubai hotels but its very fresh in a stylish kind of way. The rooms are very nice spacious with a great wardrobe and clean and I love the neutral colours with some arabic decor elements. Although i have no objections to arabic style rooms sometimes they are too dark and in poorly lit rooms at times i feel like being in a grotto. I have stayed in the hotel in November once it has opened and then again in December both times with kids so i have to mention the Kids Club and the girls that work there. My children loved them. It is not a big room if there are a lot of kids it will feel a little crowded we have not experienced that so far. I loved the fact that they can order lunch for your child while he she is playing inside. My kids seem to eat better when they are around other children and when i am not around. I have been to a few hotels in Dubai and i do not remember any Kids Club offering this service. During our stay there was some construction going on but honestly i did not feel disturbed maybe because i did not spend too much time around that area and on the beach in general. I m sure it will be over soon. Regarding the beach yes its not long those who feel like taking strolls as in some other hotels wo nt be able to do that. For me personally it is fine as i am usually very lazy on the beach. Regarding the restaurants in the hotel is where at the beginning i had the only con so to speak. Have to mention the room service food its surprisingly delicious The hotel makes effort to please the kids with special plates and cutlery. I know it may seem like not much but my kids loved it. I think the only issue i had is that in the evening the choice is quite limited when you are with kids. The Suq is nice but its mostly a buffet and by the time i get everything my food gets cold. So i do prefer a la carte version for dinner so i do not have to run around. Sea Fu restaurant serves asian food and my kids are not fans. Shai Salon serves great nibbles. Hendricks bar and Mercury Lounge are not for children anyway and i did not get the chance to visit them yet. Like i said there are kids menu everywhere but. we do not always use it as it can get a little repetitive for children its the same everywhere. so that is why for us personally food choice was limited. Having said all that there is a building right next to the hotel with new restaurants restaurant village and a club if i am not mistaken. It has opened right before we left so we did not get the chance to visit it yet. I was told there is a great Turkish restaurant there. Once the village opens fully you will have a great choice of restaurants which is great. Overall. we loved our stay hoping to come back in March. Thanks to Olesya Evgeniya and Maria in reception Samir and all the other guys around pool beach area and thanks to life guards who watch kids like hawks.", "offset": [1410, 1590], "date": "2015-01-12", "cpt": "0", "category": "beach"}, {"id": 2, "uid": "818c2bb0-4d63-4838-b2fc-d3c4414cf718", "sentence": "Five stars for Four Seasons. We just returned from spending four nights at the Four Seasons Dubai on our way back to Australia. It is an amazing hotel and even though it is very new it runs like a well oiled machine. We travelled with our two young children and they were welcomed and treated wonderfully. The spa experience was very relaxing. The staff were exceptional a special mention to Lawrence the manager at Suq who personally oversaw every detail of the service. He would always stop by for a chat and helpful advice about Dubai. The rooms and the common areas are so luxurious it felt like we were staying in a palace. Given that it was winter we did not spend a lot of time on the beach but it seemed nice.

Decided to give this hotel a try after already experiencing other beachfront properties Mina Madinat Burj Arab Jumeirah One and Only Arabian Court over the years. Prior to arrival I had my doubts if booking a new hotel was such a good idea. Upon arrival early morning. We were greeted by a very chirpy chap at reception who made us very welcome. We were aware that our room would not be available until the afternoon and were given the option to change at the spa. We were then kindly shown the spa gym facilities by staff impressive and well laid out over the course of the week we used the spa everyday. Made our way to the family swimming pool where we spent the next few hours. We found the pool to be adequate as was the beach for our needs the staff were attentive and polite. The construction project out at sea and shoring up of rocks did attract our attention but was never really an issue. The fact that the top floor hotel suites were still under construction was very surprising. On being shown our room it was a really good size and had all the usual Four Seasons facilities. We had 3 devices using the complimentary standard Wifi and no problems were encountered. Expect to ring room service every time you need milk coffee for the machine this is not replenished daily. Only used the Suq restaurant for breakfasts which were of a good standard although a little pricey. Most nights we would eat out of the hotel but on a few occasions room service was ordered which was of a good standard and very efficient. Our child attended the kids club daily which she enjoyed thoroughly probably the best Four Seasons club visited so far great staff. Sarah from reception deserves a mention very professional and attentive to a clients needs whereas her colleague looked a little lost. This is not the most exciting of reviews but to be honest I just feel that the hotel was good and the staff overall slightly better. Would I return maybe but give it a couple of years feel things may of been rushed to open this soon. Something just seems missing at the moment but I am sure the hotel will be worthy of its 5 stars going forward.", "offset": [804, 920], "date": "2015-03-13", "cpt": "0", "category": "beach"}, {"id": 4, "uid": "c58dd296-d591-4152-be98-d0edd3398e5d", "sentence": "Nice product but pricey and still working out the wrinkles. Arrival was solid. Despite being almost fully booked the reception was well staffed and we were addressed almost immediately. The wait in the tea lounge while they got a room ready was comfortable and once it became apparent that it would take a while longer the concierge escorted us to the spa so we could change and use the beach. They later brought our keys out to the sunbed. Conclusion despite a relatively long check in wait proper service made it a pleasant experience. Now the odd for some strange reason the hotel does not sell day passes to the beach. Ok no problem first year of operation high end experience understood. The way they control the beach however is quite unusual there are rope barriers placed across literally every path to the beach. They have a sign saying access is restricted to hotel residents. Poor choice of words. After changing in the spa we made our way to the beach only to encounter these strange blue rope barriers everywhere. Assuming we were guests of the hotel and not residents since we were not in a serviced apartment and that is the meaning of resident in most hotels we searched for another access but they all had the same sign. Finally a staff member clarified that by residents they meant anyone staying in the hotel and so were were allowed past the magical blue rope. Word of advice in most resorts along Dubais beaches access is simply handled by security who are sufficiently organized that they know who is a guest and who is not. No need for ropes cryptic signs nor semantic distinctions. Once in the room here are the pluses very large well lit and comfortable. Everything works despite this being a new hotel and that is also an achievement. The bathroom is a generous six piece which is about right for this level of hotel. The product is clearly high end. Considering the competition it faces not sure if the price is justified though. Maybe it will taper down to a more reasonable rate after the first year and the novelty wear off. Went to Coya a very nice restaurant which is on hotel grounds but operated separately. To get there we had to exit the hotel building and ask for directions. They pointed us in the generally correct direction and left us to figure it out. Either there is a hidden indoor path which is not obvious which we were not shown or the only connection is a bumpy textured cobblestone driveway which was quite unpleasant on my wifes high heels. Advice if there is a less arduous path make it clear and show it to the guests when asked. If it does not exist yet surely someone can make that happen without major effort. Received a strange call from front desk at 1030 pm asking if we wanted help with luggage the next day. Surely this is not the best time of day for such a call. I understand that the hotel is fully booked with possibly many checkouts the next day but a 1030 pm phone call realySumary efficient front desk strange beach access luxurious rooms service ok but on expensive side for what you get.", "offset": [1381, 1546], "date": "2015-03-21", "cpt": "0", "category": "beach"}, {"id": 5, "uid": "8b3d3103-dfc0-439b-a5a8-f76548633281", "sentence": "Relaxing wonderful holiday.

Another plus of the hotel is the restaurant venues which operate in its doorstep like coya scalini nusred verda and the latest addition Namos which makes your choices very extensive.", "offset": [213, 318], "date": "2020-01-02", "cpt": "2", "category": "beach"}, {"id": 22, "uid": "432134cd-cf1a-4331-9249-e85df1138fff", "sentence": "Typical Four Seasons.

We stayed at several Four Seasons resorts such as Chiang Mai Langkawi Saint Jean Cap Ferat and Marrakech and the one from Dubai at Jumeirah Beach is not at the same level at all. While in other Four Seasons properties you are Mr or Ms X here you are a room number as you always have to mention your room number before enjoying any services. In other Four Seasons they call you by your name so they already know what you need before asking. And you can imagine that this makes a huge different through your entire stay. The resort is too big and there is no notion of exclusivity and no attention to details. Sometimes you even feel you \u2019re at a Club Med. And we have so many examples in mind when it comes to differences with the other Four Seasons we stayed in as everything is connected. Guests should also know that the official pictures of the beach they see are a lie because they are old. The beach is awful with constructions on each side and even in front of it with many cars moving on the artificial island. Oh and there is now NAMOS beach club right next to the spa which means you have cheap and loud music during your stay at Four Seasons Dubai. I\u2019m sorry for the few involved people delivering good service in this resort such as the housekeepers we met during our stay but this hotel is far below expectations. I would not complain if I would have paid for a non Four Seasons place but prices here are ridiculously high. Next time we stay in Dubai we \u2019l definitely try another resort such as Mandarin OneOnly or Atlantis. As I like leaving honest advises I have to admit that the food at the resort is good especially the Folia vegan dishes that are very delicate and tasteful the Indian food and naan bread and the breakfast at SUQ the Black Cod at Sea Fu and the moutabel and hot chocolate at Shai.", "offset": [1572, 1850], "date": "2020-02-25", "cpt": "2", "category": "beach"}, {"id": 28, "uid": "c9e8f29d-3b1a-49ad-82d5-d9aa727968e0", "sentence": "Had visited Sea Fu restaurant amazing food.
