We had made reservations months in advance for a business convention. We came in a day early to celebrate our anniversary. I had called 4 times to confirm a King room with a Strip view. I was told yes we had this as we are Platinum for Life members. From the moment we arrived it was a nightmare. We were told they had over sold the King rooms by 90 rooms so we were placed in a room overlooking the back of the hotel with two beds. I finally was connected with a nice person who told me this was wrong but there was nothing she could due to being oversold. The next morning the nice lady informed us that we were being moved to a better room but no King beds. We spoke with 4 different people telling us we would be moved very soon. I gave all 4 people my cell phone number asking them to call as soon as our room was ready. Finally at 320 pm I went to the front desk telling them we had not left the hotel the entire day as we were waiting for our room. The person said we called you. I showed her my phone nothing. They called our HOME PHONE. This is after is specifically told them to call my cell. Then the icing on the cake is the last night a dog was in the room next to us. The dog barked the entire night. We did not sleep two hours. We were told when we checked out that bringing pets is a privilege. Really. The customer service in this hotel has gotten terrible.

Stayed here for a week while attending a conference. Check in was quick and we were very pleased with our room view Belagio Fountain below and city. Just a beautiful view of the city overall. The room was nicely equipped. Lots of room to spread out and relax. The beds were probably the most comfortable we have ever slept in. Lots of pillows. Loved the TV menu and how we could log in to our netflix account and catch up on our own shows we watch. Bathroom was beautiful with double sinks and separate water closet. Safe and closet area also was convenient to hang some business clothes and lock up valuables. The room has an area with a mini fridge which we wished we could have had EMPTY. It was filled to the brim with overpriced alcohol sodas and snacks. Be careful to NOT knock anything over in the fridge or it will automatically charge to your room. We purchased most of our drinks across the street at the CVS pharmacy but there is no where to chill them. Next time we come we will bring a small cooler. There is no room in the fridge for your own beverages. Pool Hot Tub areas were nice. During the day they have water misters going every so often above the chairs to keep you cool. However it was disappointing they only stayed open until 7 pm. We were told by one of the pool staff that they close them to get the clubs ready to open. This made several people around us a little upset so just know before you go that going to the po hot tub to relax at night is NOT an option.

My wife and I travel 4 6 times a year to do just that and always stay in 4 star resorts and do not mind spending extra to feel like a king and queen in luxury for a week. With that said our feelings were although the wrap around fountain view from the balcony was beautiful it was clear that the room it is self had been used extensively with only surface cleaning. Furniture in the suite showed distress and the bits on the balcony were fiercely abused with broken table tops. The kitchen area was well set up however with NO coffee maker it left me venturing down to the crowded lines within the casino each morning to purchase a 10 cup of java. Lighting fixture controls were all on Lutron dimmers with two master control pads. With a suite as large as this that was a nice feature however if you wanted to control the lights individually masters were only all on or all off. you soon found most of the independent switches on each light either broken or malfunctioning.

I was traveling with a friend who is not a Vegas regular. We booked a double room with a balcony no strip or fountain view. The upgrade offered at check in did not seem worth the expense. We did have a balcony on a high floor and it was perfect for us. You will have to decide if you REALLY want that fountain viewThe layout of the room was okay a bit smaller than I am used to NOT a suite like Palazo. We had a sink and cupboards maybe this was a condo previously. We did have a small couch and sitting area along with a chair on the balcony. Bathroom was nice but who needs a tub. All glass shower and great products. Overal the room was nothing special but adequate. The spa was EXCELLENT. If you like spas and that type of amenity GO. My service was awesome and the jacuzi steam lockers etc were all fantastic. Fitness area was okay a bit small and narrow. Treadmills elipticals etc. The casino was disappointing for me. The tables were very expensive and I had trouble finding entertaining slots. We did play blackjack at a table right on the strip on our last night. The dealer was very nice talkative and made our time at the table very enjoyable. The drink service was extremely good. We spent one afternoon at the pool. It was nice and relaxing. Nothing stood out good polside service and friendly people. Overall we had a great time with our Cosmopolitan experience. The location is very god right in the middle of the strip.

Just recently stayed here for 4 nights April 2017. Front desk staffers are quick to attend to customers. I booked the King Terrace studio overlooking the Strip Boulevard. and the room is larger than standard rooms has separate sleeping and living. seating areas each with mounted flat screen TVs decor is tastefully done bed and pillows are comfy spacious bathroom with separate large shower bubbler soaking bathtub and double vanity which was favorable to my hubby so we do not have to share sinks and plenty of lights we are able to control to dim and soften illumination. Certain things that I thought was odd was the microwave in the room but no dishes to heat or warm your food on and no cofemaker and coffee. Water and snacks on the mini bar and mini fridge are just absolutely ridiculously priced 10 for a 15 liter of Fiji water 6 for a can of soda 812 for small snacks nuts and small wine bottles are way overpriced. We ended up walking across the boulevard to Walgrens to pick up a couple of bottled water and some snacks. On our first night we found out that the floor to ceiling slide door windows to the Terrace facing the Boulevard side are not soundproof so the music and noises outside were very pronounced and continued into the morning hours so I was unable to sleep at all and ended up requesting another room that is much quieter. Kehndal at the front desk was very helpful and was able to transfer us without any problem to a more relaxing room. I then realized the next day that I had left my 2 opal rings in the previous room we occupied but when security checked with the housekeeping he was informed that they did not find any rings BumerWe tried their buffet for dinner which was okay and priced less than Caesars Palace bufet some food are served in small portions which I thought was smart avoiding too much waste. Crab legs are a hit to many diners some even load their plates and come back for more. I could care less. I was surprised to find out that you have to get in a long line and wait for as long as an hour to be seated and this was during midweek.

Cosmo is the hippest fanciest casino hotel in Vegas that attracts the youngest most beautiful people and the rooms designed as condos not hotel rooms have useful features and are very guest friendly. Nonetheless the hotel is quite flawed \u2026. Roms. The studio suite and 1BR suite have sitting areas 2 TVs a Jacuzi bath and a fridge and Microwave and a terrace frequently with a Belagio fountain view. What \u2019s not to like. Well quite frankly the rooms are more flashy than elegant even with all the lights on and the curtains open they are dark and the cleaning staff does not do a thorough job. The rooms at the Wyn Encore are better designed and \u201c happier and the rooms at Aria are more elegant than flashy. If I did n\u2019t love my host practicality and the location convenience of the Cosmo and the sportsbok area I would stay at Encore or Aria or Vdara for their rooms. Cleanliness Housekeeping. Maybe it \u2019s generational but both the rooms housekeeping and the bar wait staff were not taken care of. An entertaining story about the bathroom I take baths in hotels \u2013 they relax me. But I am aware that they may not be properly cleaned have read on line stories \u201c never take a bath in a hotel \u201d. so I quickly do a soap and washcloth cleaning before my first bath. No I am not a clean freak but this just makes sense. Well on arrival I looked in the bath saw a few small hairs and a couple of fingernail clippings. So I called housekeeping first time in 20 years. and they sent someone over to clean. After cleaning the bath she asked if I wanted anything else \u2013 I said no. But afterwards I looked around and saw that there were some smudges and dirt in the shower area so I cleaned myself and told management. And just as a test before leaving the next day I pulled 3 hairs from my head and left them in the bathtub. When I came back after the room was cleaned one was still there \u2013 obviously housekeeping is more about speed than thoroughness. And as for the bar \u2013 I sat down at the Chandelier Bar and there were about 10 dirty classes \u2013 I moved them to the side to make a space for me I will upload a photo. There were 3 bartenders on duty. It was 10 minutes before any of them bothered to clear them away and they still left four. WhatCasino. The Casino layout is easy to navigate and there is a choice of games \u2013 if you play BJ you can play a nice 8deck game with 3 2 odds at 25 minimum. If you need to do a 15 minimum you have to play 6 5 which is not acceptable \u2013 in that case you should switch to video poker or craps to minimize your losses. Dealers and wait staff are pleasant. Sports Book is run by Cantor Gaming which means you get good odds and lots of choices. And the bar next to it is overcrowded during football season \u2013 great if you do n\u2019t mind crowds. The buffet is overpriced but very good to excellent China Poblano used to be good but some new dishes stink eg way too much cumin in the dumplings. Secret Pizza is good by west coast standards but no better than average by NY or Chicago standards STK is very happening but food is B only. I do like the Greek place Milos. The gym is full of new equipment and quite frankly packed in the mornings. But very nice. If you want eye candy you will find it in droves \u2013 a very young beautiful crowd. So if you are going to Vegas with friends for sports food action and convenience stay at the Cosmo.

We stayed on the 18th floor in the Chelsea and never had a problem with noise during our entire stay. The Chelsea pool was also quieter than the Boulevard pool but if you want entertainment and noise try the Marquee day and night club. The hotel is well situated on the strip and we managed to walk over twenty miles during the day visiting all the other hotels and the Welcome to Las Vegas sign and then back out again at night for food and drink.
