It is hardwired in our psychology to make stronger memories of negative experiences so we can avoid them in the future. So good and happy times all blend into an indistinct continuum while bad times are often never forgotten. Similarly twenty good reviews can be negated by one bad one. This tendency can be exploited by those with an agenda or reinforced by those who are unreasonably demanding. Bad reviews should be read with this in mind. That said I had intended to start off with my negative experiences while spending a week at Turnbery for a combo of business and vacation. We had absolutely none. Our day of both arrival and departure changed multiple times due to winter weather. Turnbery was completely accommodating with all the changes. I arrived by myself at 10 am and expected to wait all day for a room. Lovely Stephanie at registration welcomed me and told me she would do her best move me in immediately. It took some time for her to search but she succeeded and next thing I was being led through a beautifully landscaped terrace and into Hibiscus. Our room was very spacious with a large and very comfortable king bed and a balcony overlooking the Cascata pool and fountain. This balcony was a lovely sunny place to sit and watch the sunset. The Cascata pool is for adults and is very peaceful. The bathroom was all marble and mosaic tile with a huge tub and separate shower soft robes and slippers and Moulton Brown toiletries. The toilet was in its own room with a phone. A small minibar allowed some room for our own items to be refrigerated. There is a much larger pool for families at the other side of the resort. This pool is understandably much louder and had live music two of the days we were there. Riding in a tube on the lazy river enjoying a mojito and listening to a steel drum band is a very fun way to spend some time. There was a large jacuzi with strong jets and a very fun waterslide too. There were many chaises and cabanas to be had but they tended to fill quickly. The attendants are very accommodating in finding you a spot and setting you up with a chaise liner towels and umbrellas if you need them. We were at the adult pool most of the time and the attendant there Juan Pablo is a treasure. I watched him from my balcony from early morning until late evening working very hard. He always found us seats in our favourite area and I witnessed him dealing with some very demanding guests with grace and a smile. He always did his best to please. Turnbery you are lucky to have him. We also hopped the shuttle to the beach. This was a quick ride and the beach club has a restaurant cabanas hammocks a good sized pool and a game area. Jean set us up on the beach and brought lunch in a bento box. He was very attentive and pleasant. The beach club is on a lovely wide sandy area with no highrises to shadow in the afternoon it so the sun shines very late. Once you are settled there you will not want to leave the azure ocean. Aventura mall is right across the street from the hotel and you can shuttle there too but why go to a mall with such a beautiful resort to enjoy. The spa and fitness center were very luxurious. On day one I went in to book a massage and saw that they had many fitness classes so I bought a package of 6. Next day I went back for a pilates class to learn that a lot of the classes were for members only. So I asked for a refund for my classes and used the state of the art equipment and 4 mile jogging trail around the resort instead. No problem except on checkout the charge was still there. I went to the spa and they apologised most graciously and removed the charge. I had a wonderful massage with Nely. I wanted a deep tissue myofascial release sports massage and she delivered. Breakfast buffet at Corsair was very good but too much food for me. I was happy with fruit yoghourt and baked goods with a latte from the lobby coffee shop eaten out by the fountain in the sun. I have never had a multigrain seeded croissant before. We ate at Corsair three times which we enjoyed very much. Their Valentines prix fix dinner was good value and the food was top notch. Still dreaming about the Burata with winter veg and hazelnuts and the shortrib agnoloti with horseradish agliata. We tried Bourbon Steak and it was very crowded and noisy not at all as fresh and creative but much more expensive. Steak lovers will be in heaven. The bar there however is a lovely place to have a craft cocktail or after dinner drink. The selection of libations is very high standard. The food at the two pools and the beach was good but was the same in all three places. This is my only complaint as the menu was limited and got boring pretty quickly. It seems it would not be too difficult to give each location its own individually tweaked menu so that each place is a unique lunch destination. Keep the same menu at Laguna for families at Cascata add some adult sophistication or ethnic influences or even open up some of Corsairs lunch menu to polside and make beach fare more Floribean. Finally my memory fails me in remembering all the wonderful people who went out of their way to help me anytime I seemed to be in need. One young man took it upon himself to locate the stairs in the Hibiscus building as I could not find them and he did not know. A very pleasant blond lady went out of her way to furnish me with a shuttle schedule when she saw me standing uncertainly out front. Everyone I passed smiled and asked what they could do or wished me a good day. I had no bad indifferent or negative service. We had a very relaxing time at this wonderful hotel and I will most readily return.", "offset": [4723, 4867], "date": "2015-02-18", "cpt": "0", "category": "transport"}, {"id": 2, "uid": "5407215d-d42f-41aa-bc72-82f66f7534b6", "sentence": "Property remains excellent with a few kinks that should not exist. We stayed here 3 nights and with few exceptions had a very good time. Next time we would probably want a room in the Jasmine section which is more centrally located to the pool and the main building. It is a bit of a walk to the Marigold building. Fortunately Mariot does not actually manage the property they just use the reservation system. so they have not gone out and ruined what makes the place special. Food and beverage remains generally excellent the new Italian restaurant Corsair is OK but not nearly as good as Bourbon. Frankly we found it a bit pretentious. 16 for soup that did not even cover the bottom of the plate. The server sympathized with our protestation and took it off the bill. A few thoughts There are some kinks here that are surprising given that this place is a 5 star property that is very highly rated and you expect certain things to just make sense when you are in the business of dealing with people every day 1 when we checked in our room was not ready so they did not give us a room number. Meanwhile we were booking tennis lessons and a garden tour and leaving baggage for room delivery. People asked for our room number but we did not have one so they asked for our last name. Eventually we showed up for the various items but nobody had a record of us because there was no room number given from the get go. 2. We wanted some fish fried up for our kids dinner but there was no fish items on the kids menu. The chef at Corsair had an attitude issue and refused to make it even though they had plenty of fish at the restaurant. After being turned down twice we spoke to a manager who said it would be done. When we came back another evening they made it and our kids devoured their plates. But we should not have had to go around begging for this the first time. 3. At the gym they have an aerobics studio with a lot of equipment in it that people expect to use in a gym but you can not get to it unles the instructor is there and they keep the whole room locked up. 4. The driveway to the valet gets completely gridlocked when there are functions at the hotel. Had we not intercepted our car from the garage and gone out a side entrance we probably would have missed our flight. 5. The spa has a wet sauna and that is about it. No jacuzi or dry sauna. I do not see why it is rated so highly. My treatment was good but these days you expect some amount of Wow factor at a highly rated spa. 6. At the pool they do not give out sunscreen and you have to buy it. They had one product and I asked what it cost. The person was not sure and asked 3 people and was going to just keep me there waiting while they figured it out. 6 examples of kinks in a system that should not exist when you do this kind of stuff every day at a high level. Hopefully somebody there will take some notes. The other caveat I mention here is that the traffic in the local area around the hotel is insane if you come to this property you want to stay on the property as much as possible and try to avoid driving in the area during the evening rush hours. Fortunately the property is private enough that you lose sense of the surrounding city. That is a strength but it is utterly draining when you leave it if you get caught in the traffic that surrounds it.", "offset": [137, 266], "date": "2015-02-22", "cpt": "0", "category": "transport"}, {"id": 3, "uid": "89b53d88-236f-4920-aa14-ddafd853426e", "sentence": "Poor service tough location. Was here at the end of January for a vacation work conference. Definitely a nice time of the year for Miami. but I had advise avoiding this resort. The rooms are nice the grounds are pretty and the beach club is good but several service hiccups marred our trip and I do not know they are indicative of only isolated incidents. First when we arrived we needed to wait over an hour for our room to get ready. While I will admit we were early we were there for a conference that began at 30. you had think the hotel should have anticipated an influx of people arriving for the conference before 30 and had rooms ready in my opinion. My wife had to get ready for the conference in a locker room as did many other attendees. Secondly we were woken up around 6 am the next day because the golf course was being mowed outside our window. It sounded like we were right above I95. We requested a move which was acomodated but the front desk said that the mowing occurred every other day and they do not typically get complaints about it. I can not see how others would not be bothered. Third I and several other guests had to wait 45 extra minutes at the end of the day for the shuttle to run as back from the beach club. The shuttle driver told us traffic was not the cause for the delay but that he had been called off his route for a one off pickup which the beach club desk had no idea about. Fourth following the shuttle bus incident I had finally had enough and complained to the front desk. They promised a call back that day with some sort of resolution. That never came and when I mentioned it again while checking out they again promised to follow up. Again they did nothing. Finally the prices are laughably outrageous here. It is clearly a hotel designed for folks paying with a corporate card but even still 30 for the only tube of sunscreen in the gift shop. You are not able to walk anywhere either.

I was really looking forward to a few days away with my husband. I am the caregiver for my mother with with Alzheimers so I was looking for rest and relaxation. The hotel is very nice and most hotels we looked into were on the expensive side but I just do not think this one was worth it. My husband had been here for a golf trip a few weeks before a had a good experience and thought it would be a good place for me to decompress. I think I would only stay here again if my husband wanted to golf. Our room was nice nice and quite large. I think the name of the building we were in was the jasmine. I loved the bathroom. There were two sinks a vanity for putting on makeup and lots of space. The bad thing about our room is that it was above the private members room and there was a party there one night. I was exhausted and ready for bed at 10 pm but the vibration from the music kept me up until the party was over. I called the front desk at 11 pm to find our how late the music and they acted like they knew nothing about the party but said they would call security. I called again later and they transferred me to security. My advice is to not stay on the 2nd floor of jasmine if a party is going to be held in the private club room. The pools were nice. I laid out at the adult pool one day. The pool was nice but service at the pool was lacking. When I went to check out I noticed that we had charges at Corsair restaurant of 16 16and 136. Breakfast came with my room so I did not understand why I had the charges. When I inquired without looking at my account the girl at the front desk ask if the were for 16. How did she know that. If they know that charges are inadvertently put on accounts why are not they checked before going to the hotel guest. Also there is Fiji water next to the coffee maker and in my room there was nothing on the bottle about a charge for it but I was charged. They ended up taking it off my bill. On a positive note most every employee was very hospitable. I took the shuttle to the mall one day and the shuttle driver noticed me waking back to the hotel and stopped and asked if I had like a ride back.", "offset": [2019, 2165], "date": "2015-03-06", "cpt": "0", "category": "transport"}, {"id": 5, "uid": "6258df4d-13b9-4278-84b5-3a0987353074", "sentence": "Fancy.

We found ourselves at Magnolia Building and I have to say although NOT newly renovated and a bit outdated the room was huge and I have to admit I liked it a lot.
