Then the 2nd day I had trouble changing the toilet roll so left the fresh new roll on top of the dispenser expecting the cleaners to help change it. Nope came back after the room was serviced with the toilet roll still sitting on top of the dispenser not in it. If you pride yourself as a PULLMAN hotel why would you leave the roll like that. The next day the room was not even serviced. We were out from 250 onwards. Came back late to no fresh linen or towels.

Am not not used to car parks and do not know the difference between a Wilson one or any other. Should have been explained a bit better as when the voucher did not work we took a Wilson ticket and explained to hotel reception and they said it was the wrong one.
