Easy to get to the city by Airoexpres. Or take bus 651 it stops right in front of the Park Inn entrance. The hotel staff is very friendly and acomodating. I arrived 6 hours before official admittance time and got the room immediately for no extra charge. The room is basic but clean. Reliable free WiFi. Bathroom toiletries consist of two dispensers one for hands the other for the rest of you. Climate control is good. Small grocery shop booth in front. Overall the hotel provides all a traveller needs between flights with long connection time. I recommend it. If you came to Moscow for several days find a hotel downtown.

The hotel is a standard airport hotel good for a 1 night sleep before an early flight. Rooms are clean restaurant downstairs is good. I landed at terminal D and while there is 1 sign in the terminal towards the hotel shuttle. once you are outside there is no signage or even dedicated stop. I wandered around wanted to go back into the terminal to ask but was prevented to as you can not enter the arrival hall once you are outside for security reasons luggage gets scanned upon entering the terminal and that is only available at the departures level one level up. So I gave up and decided to walk to the hotel but around the airport it is a maze with highways underpasses etc. It took me 30 minutes to get there crossing at the most irresponsible spots. Had a lot of luggage which made this even less enjoyable. The poor signage is a big problem and takes away from any felt comfort once you have arrived at the hotel itself.

By just looking at the map the hotel was just 500 60 m away from Terminal D so we thought it \u2019s walkable. But when we went outside the airport we found that there were only highways in the front and no passenger walkways at all. So we dropped the idea of walking to the hotel and decided to go back to the airport information counter to ask for direction but the security guard prohibited us from re entering the airport. Originally he refused to speak with us in English Fortunately he finally used his limited English to tell us the hotel shuttle bus stop was located at aisle 75 outside the airport at which we caught the 30min frequency bus. It was a 5 8 min ride to the hotel from Terminal D as there was a lot of highways. On the next day when we leave the hotel to airport we found that it \u2019s walkable to Terminal F in 5 min by passing through the Aeroexpres train terminal which is right next to the hotel building.
