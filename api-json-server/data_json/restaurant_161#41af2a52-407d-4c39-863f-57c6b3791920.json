The hotel is wonderful it is huge and has a great range of activities golf spa water sports. The staff were wonderful. So friendly and so helpful when we were booking our activities. A special thank you to Min Lat manager Indira and Anes for taking really good care of my brother when they found out about his nut allergy and organised a chef to cook him stuff individually. Which brings me on to the food. The reason I booked this resort was because of the countless reviews I saw that praised the food. High praise indeed. There was a lot of choice between all the different restaurants and the food was of an incredible standard. In terms of activities it was great they had a rep on site in the hotel to help book the excursions and provide you with all the information about them.

We stayed 14 night beginning of October all inclusive Arrived late evening and were met by private car at the airport which was swift and efficient. On arrival at the hotel check in was late but quiet and done quickly we were met with a welcome drink and then escorted to our room promptly. We had room 420 which was comfortable and clean but not a great view of the car park This was booked as garden view however the room was only to sleep so was of no consequence. The housekeeper was very attentive twice daily We stayed 14 nights and was relaxing and very enjoyable as a couples break. Free wifi in the hotel worked very well enough to email message and FaceTime and worked everywhere. The first week the pool area was quiet sun beds and beach beds plenty and any restaurant accessible on the day reservations made the day before. The palmito bar very good with Denis the bar tender excellent and a lovely guy. The second week was busier being half term in the UK With queues in every bar and restaurant at lunchtime and also reservations made for the other restaurants at least a week in advance in order to get preferred times. La traviata was exceptional the manager friendly and attentive. Shooters was also very good although quiet whilst we were thereThe sports bar was our favourite in the evening just for the short walk there The cocktail bar on the 7th floor was very good and we went for pre dinner drinks there most evenings and occasionally after dinner. The bar and waiting staff were very friendly and attentive and a credit to the hotel. Most cocktails and drinks available on the all inclusive package just look for the little sun signs on each menu for what is included. If in doubt the bar staff were very helpful. Entertainment in the cocktail bar was a very good duo who interacted with the clients and truly lived for the music. Being there for a couple of weeks we also booked some excursions via Arabian adventures in the hotel. The new Dubai tour was good with a trip up the burj khalifa but the old Dubai tour seemed rushed and could have done with a whole day spent touring. Dubai mall is a must as is the fountain evenings better. We also went to the Atlantis aquarium and could have spent a good few hours in there ask the staff any question you like and they will explain in great detail. The free shuttle bus is a must from the hotel but times not great sometimes and we almost missed the bus from Dubai mall. Ibn buta mall nearest the hotel not the best limited shops found it difficult to spend even a couple of hours here. Have been to Dubai a couple of times now and the mall of the emirates and the Dubai mall far better. Taxi instead of bus around \u00a3 20The hotel and grounds were very well kept with most staff saying a friendly hello in passing. The view from the beach not fantastic with an unfinished bridge on one side and an aluminium plant on the right but not close enough to intrude on the overall picture. We did not find it hindered the holiday in any way The hotel was quite a way out of the city hence the reason why we chose the all inclusive option well worth the money.

All areas of the resort were kept immaculately clean and every member of staff from reception to beach attendants worked tirelessly and attentively. 5 service. The 9 hole golf course was kept in perfect condition with very welcome cold towels and water being handed out on course. A challenge for all standards. The quality of food for an all inclusive resort was outstanding even the buffet contained an excellent variety of dishes for all tastes. Fortunately after reading reviews I had taken the liberty of pre booking a few restaurants as we were a party of 9 otherwise it would of led to one of my few criticisms of the resort. As it was our first stay we had no idea of the dining options and wanted to settle in before we chose where to eat each night. Having pre booked Shooters and La Traviata both a must we were hoping to try Divas and return to La Traviata but were soon told that there were no reservations available for the remainder of our stay. We wish we were told in advance of the necessity of pre booking and I strongly recommend you pre book for at least 80 of your stay. But again the buffet and Captains bar are a very good standard so you are not left eating in your room by any means. The only other disappointment was the artistic use of all in all inclusive when it came to the 3rd party activities such as water sports and the spa facilities. On closer inspection your options are quite limited eg windsurfing beginners rig only sailing and kayaking are only available for a few time slots per day which soon got fully booked. So if you wanted to do one of the so called all inclusive activities so had to pay. This soon made sense once we discovered it was a franchise as I guess these places need to make their money somewhere. If money is no object then you have a wonderful variety of water sports available you. And be warned the Wibit water park has some mighty sharp edges in places which can lead to some very salty stinging. Also the spa only allow one free visit to use the hot tub sauna etc. And you could not go as a couple as ladies were allowed in the morning and gents in the afternoon. But I can see why that may be. I fully expect to pay for treatments etc but the occasional use of a sauna etc is usually covered in an all inclusive package. But these are minor complaints and ones that I feel do not warrant losing that 5th star. A few people may complain that areas of the resort are tired compared to many 5 resorts out there. so yes aesthetically this is a 4 resort. But for our family of 9 ranging from age 8 to 75 our overall experience was definitely 5Thank you so much to all the wonderful staff that made our stay so enjoyable.

For our first 3 days breakfast was fine and we were provided a Diet Coke when we asked for it around 1030 with breakfast I do not drink juice. however on day 4 this suddenly became a problem and apparently I was n\u2019t allowed this. That is fine if that \u2019s true but I should n\u2019t be told different things from different staff members. The resort is so big you need to be given a map on which restaurants are where it \u2019s not very clear. However staff are always happy to help and jump on a buggy when needed. Overall food was good did n\u2019t once have a bad meal. Be careful what you order though we ordered proseco in Vasco de gama on every night and this was included in our all inclusive package but when we ordered proseco from the restaurant apparently it \u2019s not included there. We were not told this and why would it be different. Luckily reception staff took it off our bill in the end. but just be carefulVASCO DE GAMA super chilled vibes in here for cocktails and popcorn. East meets west play here and they \u2019re fab. Such a wide range of music from current chart music to queen to Rod Stewart. Anything. BIG SHOUTOUT to MAK. He made our stay so warm and welcoming and if you are lucky will have a quick boogie with you. He works very hard and your glass is never empty with MAK. We love you. All of the bar staff in here are amazing. WHITE ORCHID this is even more chilled here. Very beautifully presented too. HAZEL AND YANG are the duo here and we can not fault them. We would come back JUST FOR THEM. They take requests and can literally sing anything. Hazel has a bloody fantastic voice and she \u2019s such a beautiful singer. Her business partner. YANG absolutely nails the acoustic guitar and also has a fantastic voice. We absolutely LOVED karaoke with them on a Wednesday in sports cafe. The Itinerary of what is going on which you can access from the tv is incorrect and needs updating as a Brit I love a good schedule so followed it and found ourselves arriving too early for performances. SPA we can not fault this one bit the SPA it was one of the best massages I \u2019ve EVER had and I \u2019ve had my fair share all over the world. The staff are so friendly and smiley andWould do anything for you. Amazing. SWIMMING POOLS there are 3 pools all superClean and all have swim up bars. The pool staff are SO helpful and super kind always checking our chairs are okay and helping with the umbrellas. Our favourite was \u201c P POOL \u201d. right in front of the lobby. Staff here are amazing and the lifeguards never take their eyes off the pool. WATER SPORTS water sports at the beach are included in the all inclusive package between certain times. We tried paddle boarding and kayaking. The staff here are very helpful and funny \u2019. We had a fantastic afternoon trying to paddle board. I did n\u2019t catch his name but the man there was trying to Teach us made our \u201c lesson \u201d a very funny one. Highly recommend.

The hotel was not busy and this could have been a nice gesture. We also had a lot of issue when it came to meals for vegetarians from day one. The choice was extremely limited and then when the restrictions came in to place such as no buffet meals the options became extremely poor. For example the only option at dinner for a vegetarian meal in one restaurant was rice vegetables and salad. We experience issues at one of the restaurants during lunch with the staff being unhelpful and we actually ended up leaving. And on a number of occasions our room was not seen to cleaned even though we had come back to the room around 2 pm. I can understand if the hotel was extremely busy but this was not the case. We ended up checking out a day early because the service had become extremely poor. The TV in our room stopped working the food options at dinner had only one option for vegetarians rice and vegetables the only activities on offer within the hotel had to be paid for as nothing was being offered in place of the cancellations.
