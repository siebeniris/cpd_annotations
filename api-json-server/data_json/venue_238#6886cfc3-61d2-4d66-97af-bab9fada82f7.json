Spent a girls weekend at Marco Island Mariot Beach Resort Golf Club Spa and we enjoyed our selves a great deal. We were provided with a newly renovated room which was great and always cleaned before we returned to get ready for dinner. Almost all the Mariot team members we interacted with were courteous and super efficient at their respective jobs. The beach is incredible. Yes it has a lot of shells but that is some what common for the west coast in my experience. Chairs are included and if you have the 25 resort fee on your card an umbrella is also included. This was great as we did not make it downstairs until 11 some days and did not have to worry about people saving chairs. Pool is great and well maintained. Somewhat limited number of chairs. Restaurants were great and while expensive earned the cost of the dinner. Buffet for either breakfast or dinner is not worth the money. If you do go to the buffet for dinner skip the wine bar as you only receive house wine and it is not worth the cost. You can also find somewhat less expensive dinner options off campus. Hardly noticed the ongoing renovation which speaks volumes that a resort this large can maintain services and not disrupt guest.

I did not pass a single Mariot employee who did not greet me or offer me help finding my destination the place is huge and those that I actually interacted with were exceeding friendly and polite. I can not say enough about how impressed I was with the professionalism of staff. BravoThe room was spectacular Spacious clean to smell and touch well appointed and well stocked bedding incredibly comfortable this is something Mariot always does well. There was ample space to store clothing outlets to charge my electronics and toiletries galore which were replenished daily without waiting for them to be finished. I was also asked my preference for when I wanted my room serviced morning or afternoon a big plus for me since I did not have to be anywhere early and like to lounge around in the room before going downstairs. In addition there were ample activities scheduled for guests with children and even some shows a fire twirler. in the early evening that would interest adults. The resort also provides several dining and shopping options multiple pools a spa gym and conference facility. If I am completely honest the food was a little pricey eg 8 for a beer but it is a high end beach resort it is to be expected and honestly the food quality is superb.

Mariot \u2019s new adults only pricey hotel within a hotel concept shows great promise. The JW Mariot Marco Island is a large 70 rooms convention and family vacation hotel on a beautiful beach. If you are seeking a luxury hotel and the type of personal service a small hotel can offer the new \u201c Sirene \u201d rooms in the brand new Lanai tower can offer that type of experience \u2026 even in a large older Mariot resort. We stayed for five days just after the new wing opened and can report a great experience. It starts with a separate \u201c Sirene \u201d registration process \u2026 you are asked to text your arrival time and you are greeted at the door by the \u201c Sirene \u201d front desk manager and guided to a special \u201c Sirene \u201d registration room. The usual credit card and ID process is accompanied by a glass of Champagne and great advice on \u201c Sirene \u201d services. You are given a personal \u201c Sirene \u201d wrist band that unlocks the elevators to the \u201c Sirene only \u201d floors serves as your room key allows you access to the \u201c Sirene only \u201d pool and the \u201c Sirene only \u201d breakfast buffet. The rooms are well appointed with a great balcony but you should be aware of the difference between \u201c gulf view \u201d \u201c gulf front \u201d and \u201c partial gulf view \u201d rooms. While the \u201c gulf view \u201d rooms on the side of the tower do indeed have a nice view of the beach you are also looking at other resort buildings and facilities \u2026 Mariot shows the beach only view of the \u201c gulf front \u201d rooms on their room descriptions and that could be considered deceptive \u2026 they should correct this. The included \u201c Sirene \u201d breakfast buffet was great with a friendly chef to make omelets to order for you and daily specials. While we were there the buffet was uncrowded with great personal servers. The \u201c Sirene \u201d pool area is beautiful with great personal service for drinks snacks. You can request all hotel services by texting the \u201c Sirene \u201d cell number and they will handle all hotel requests \u2026 the responses were prompt and efficient. Again it is a brand new building with a new service and there are still some kinks to work through. While we were there a fire sprinkler system broke and the ground floor of the Lanai tower was flooded. Not a big deal but giant carpet dryers were running the whole time. We were told by another guest that water for the entire tower was broken for one day the prior week no water toilets etc. but that was resolved before we arrived. Final construction and roofing was being completed on the hotel and it was noisy on the balcony during the day. The \u201c Sirene \u201d pool only had a permit for daylight hours but we were told a full day night operation permit is pending. One day the pool and hot tub heater broke but was fixed the next day. The curtains in the room are difficult to open perhaps an electric curtain opener would fit the luxury \u201c Sirene \u201d model. All is all a great \u201c small adults only luxury hotel \u201d experience in a large Mariot resort with a few kinks to work out.", "offset": [116, 221], "date": "2018-12-14", "cpt": "1", "category": "venue"}, {"id": 16, "uid": "4231cb3c-86f2-4ac8-bdec-2faa68364bfb", "sentence": "Great Stay.
