Veda the hotels restaurant is very good and has made waves as a go to plant based restaurant in the HK scene. The daily Happy Hour is great too. And because we like our music the hotels playlist was super. They put us on the 3rd floor rooms for guests with disabilities. Therefore the bathroom sink was quite low and narrow. We made a bit of a mess each time we used it. While we did not hear the noise from the nearby bars we could feel the pump of the base so that may keep some guests up. It may be better to get a room on a higher floor. My friend who took the room beside me was surprised when a man suddenly entered her room using a key card. He was not in uniform and did not look like hotel personnel. The staff could not explain who he was and why he had access to her room. Wifi is a bit slow and was down completely on the last day. This apparently was prompted by an accident in one of the nearby construction sites. Luckily we brought our own mobile wifi device.
