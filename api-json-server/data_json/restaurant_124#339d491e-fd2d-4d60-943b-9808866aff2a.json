Stayed overnight here as treat for anniversary which included Elkie Brooks concert at The Lowry. The hotel is well situated close to the centre and easily acesable from Picadily Station and close to St Peter Square tram stop. We were warmly welcomed by Juan Carlos who upgraded us to the Savile Suite named after Peter Savile as they had no Deluxe room with a double bed which we had requested when we booked. Also as our train home was not until the afternoon Juan Carlos also arranged for a complimentary late checkout. The suite was very nice with a very comfortable king bed a smart TV safe iron and ironing board and a Tshibo coffee machine. The sitting area had a sofa and armchair coffee table and another TV and a radio. Off the sitting area was a good sized balcony with table chairs and sun loungers not used as it was a freezing February day. The ensuite was very nice with a walk in shower next to the bath. Just a couple of niggles one of the TV remotes did not work lots of coffee but milk only for two cups more milk was happily delivered by housekeeping and no understandable instructions on how to operate the smart TV or coffee machine. As all hotel information was loaded on the Smart TV not smart at all. Breakfast was in the Steak and Lobster Restaurant. The tables here are too close to each other and there were not enough staff serving. A good choice of food though the Full English was part of the serve yourself buffet which was disappointing. The orange juice and coffee were good and I had the eggs benedict from the menu which was delicious. Our stay in the upgaded suite was marred somewhat by some drilling and hammering from work on the fire escape right next door to the suite which we were not told about beforehand. Were also disturbed by a painter wanting access to the suite despite the do not disturb notice hanging on the door.

I have recently received several emails from yourselves asking me to leave a review of my stay on the 6 7th of August. This was the weekend of my husband \u2019s 30th birthday and I was very much looking forward to staying at the Radison Blu. When I arrived for check in the team on reception were absolutely wonderful very helpful and knowledgable about the hotel. We live fairly local so we know Manchester quite well but it was lovely that they offered advice on restaurants etc. The room itself was gorgeous fab views and very nicely appointed. However the reason I \u2019m writing was for two very unfortunate incidents that were beyond the hotel \u2019s control I believe but dealt with in a very disappointing manner and sadly marred what was a very nice stay otherwise. The first incident was when myself and two friends were dining in your Steak and Lobster restaurant after enjoying the spa facilities. The meal was fine but mid way through a mouse ran right under our table and across the floor. Obviously we were horrified and extremely disgusted but very calmly we mentioned it to the waiter who had served us. His initial reaction was to seem completely unbothered and we thought he had blown us off. A few minutes later we saw what looked to be a manager looking around for the mouse. I appreciate that the staff would n\u2019t have wanted to alarm other diners and when we pointed out the direction the mouse had run again the fact of there being a rodent in a dining establishment was brushed off by the staff. We are not the type of people to cause a fuss but we were surprised that when the bill came we were actually initially overcharged and no mention was made again of the situation. This was disappointing for several reasons the biggest of which was that there was a mouse in your restaurant and there was no apology made to us not even when we paid the bill. The second incident occurred following my wrap treatment in the Sienna Spa. I had the most amazing therapist and at the end of my treatment I was instructed to shower in the facilities in the treatment room. I did this but during my shower I noticed the water level rising. As the glass was frosted I could n\u2019t see into the room itself so I just presumed that the water was draining. However when I opened the door the room was completely flooded with dirty water. I immediately mentioned this to the therapist and showed her the floor when I left the room and she apologized but again no further mention was made by spa staff and there was no acknowledgement of what happened. When my husband and I checked out the next morning once again the reception staff were lovely and pleasant but no mention was made of either incident and it just left a bad taste in my mouth. I was not going to post this complaint publicly but after contacting both the hotels customer service desk directly AND head office and receiving no response at all not even an acknowledgement of my dissatisfaction. I feel I must. I am very very disappointed in the experience especially as it was supposed to be such a celebratory weekend.", "offset": [848, 982], "date": "2016-08-25", "cpt": "1", "category": "restaurant"}, {"id": 14, "uid": "ed6b6662-4952-407c-a528-3c83cef86e8b", "sentence": "Great evening.

We had the set menu for \u00a3 25 which came with a glass of Proseco. I had the chicken mousse which should have come with brioche however because we were so it was not ready. They served it with some other bread. It made no difference to the quality it was delicous. My partner had the salmon with cucumber sorbet wow.
