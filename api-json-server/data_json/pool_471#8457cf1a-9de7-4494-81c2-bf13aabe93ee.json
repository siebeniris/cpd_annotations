The Shangri La is an elegant somewhat older hotel a short walk from the upper end of Orchard Road in an upscale residential neighborhood. The rooms are spacious and quiet and the facilities include a beautiful swimming pool and an unusually large and well equipped gym. The buffet breakfast in the Line Restaurant offers lots of choices. This is a great hotel for those wanting classic luxury including a beautiful lobby with plenty of comfortable seating and a choice of upscale restaurants. The two drawbacks are 1 being situated rather far from public transportation which often means queueing up for a taxi particularly during the morning rush hour and 2 the high cost of hotel services including laundry. The hotel is accessible from the Orchard MRT Station but it is about a 20 minute walk not bad for going to the station downhill especially in the morning but a surefire invitation for getting drenched in Singapores heat and humidity when walking uphill from the station to the hotel. In short this is a great place to stay for a luxurious vacation or for those who can set their own schedule and do not mind taking taxis for travel within Singapore.", "offset": [190, 321], "date": "2015-03-14", "cpt": "0", "category": "pool"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "4a4a9784-6260-4e82-abb1-31bca1be3573", "sentence": "Great hotel with few minor flaws.

My wife and I stayed at the Shangri La from the 1 3 Feb On arrival at 080 after a long flight from the UK I was asked to confirm that my check in and room details were correct. My booking was for a Garden Wing Deluxe pool view with balcony. I was told that the room was not ready which I fully accepted and was asked to return about midday I checked again at midday and then again at 1 pm the room was still not ready. I was then informed by a member of staff that no rooms of this type were available. I pointed out that this booking had been made months earlier and had been confirmed on arrival as stated I was then informed that the booking had been made by a travel agent to which I asked what difference does that make no explanation was given to me and were greeted with blank stares. I was then offered an upgrade to the Valley Wing but to a room with no balcony and a depressing view of blocks of apartments. The whole reason for the booking of a Garden Wing room was for a balcony with views of the pool and gardens. As this appeared to be the only way I was going to get a room I reluctantly accepted as both my wife and I were tired after the long flight. A member of staff said they would have our luggage sent up to the room. After 30 minutes no luggage had arrived so I rang the front desk and eventually after an hour it finally arrived. That evening my wife and I went to the Lobby Lounge for a pre dinner drink a gin and tonic and a Tiger beer. The gin and tonic arrived within a minute however the beer had still not arrived after 15 minutes when I asked about my drink I was informed that they had run out of Tiger beer. REALLY. but some more had been sent for and I eventually received my Tiger beer after a 35 minute wait with no apology offered. There were other small examples of poor and impersonal service during our three day stay and at times felt that we were just being processed through the system. One in particular was that although we had a room upgrade to the Valley Wing we were informed that we were not permitted to use any of the other facilities. The Shangri La Singapore is rated as a 5 star hotel but we most certainly did not receive 5 star service during this stay. On arrival back in UK on the 20th Feb I received via email the guest experience review in which I expressed my complaint and disappointment. The response from The Manager was that he wanted more details about our experience so he could improve the service. This to me indicated that he had not read the comments but just taken note of the overall lower rating as all the details were contained in it. I duly replied giving all the details again and to date 14 March have still had no response. I have been a Golden Circle member since 204 and my wife and I have stayed in many Shangri La Hotels across Asia during that time and this was by far the worst experience in a Shangri La we have had. It will not stop us using the Shangri La chain in the future but based on this experience we will not be staying at the Shangri La Singapore again. I never thought that there would be a need for me to write such a review about a Shangri La hotel and it saddens me to have to do so.", "offset": [198, 261], "date": "2018-03-14 00:00:00", "cpt": "1", "category": "pool"}, {"id": 15, "uid": "b3a5176b-e5dd-410c-9d3d-5f6d6d5a23ee", "sentence": "Even the food poisoning was pleasant I m being serious. Last time in Singapore we stayed at the Marina Bay Sands lovely pool. service ok but a bit too business like in the way things were done and lacked a personal touch. This time we opted for the Shangri La the more I read reviews of others the more I was drawn to how much guests applauded the quality of their service and this is what drew my family and I here. We stayed for 3 nights as a family of 4 in the recently refurbished Tower Wing in a Grand Premier room with Horizon Club privileges. As our flight arrived in Singapore at 6 am I had opted for the early 10 am check in. We arrived to the hotel at 7 am and were checked in to our room immediately. What a nice welcome that is to 4 weary travelers and it exceeded my expectations. A couple of minor things to mention in the room there was a fruit paring knife and fork wrapped in a linen napkin sitting on a plate however it was next to an empty fruit bowl which I am led to believe should be full of seasonal fruits. Not so much a big deal to me. Also knowing that 4 guests were staying in the room because the sofa bed was already prepared but having only 2 bath towels was an oversight for a 5 star establishment such as the Shangri La. Oh and our first trip to the pool was a non event because someone most likely a child had poped in the pool out of your control i know but super amusing. The pool crew handled the situation promptly. But that s it I ca nt fault anything else and I m quite adept at faulting things. The service was impeccable the Horizon Club is definitely worth it if you do nt want to leave the hotel grounds. We did wander downstairs to The Line for breakfast on the second morning but it was a bit too chaotic for my liking. The variety of food on offer at the Horizon Club lounge was good enough for me. Not to mention afternoon tea shortly followed by cocktails and canapes. Unfortunately for me I came down with food poisoning the day before check out. I am aware no one else reported food poisoning however I did not eat anything outside of the Horizon Club Lounge the entire time I was in Singapore so maybe i got unlucky and it was definitely food poisoning I l spare you the details. What was surprising was the kindness and genuine care shown by the Horizon Club crew in accommodating me bringing me medicines electrolyte drinks and most importantly allowing us to remain in our room 9 hours after our original check out time giving me time to recover enough to take my flight back home. For this I have no end in thanks. The service felt personal and genuine the room the grounds and the heritage laden charm of this place is warm and inviting. Thanks for the memories this was one trip i l never forget or regret. I am an author of Philosophy and to show my appreciation for your kindness I would like to donate a few copies of my book to your hotel library should you provide a contact and an address.

Before moving forward I must make a special acknowledgement of Vivien Soh she was absolutely amazing. She is the duty manager I had the pleasure of being helped by many many times throughout the stay. She was tireless with her help honestly she is an absolute blessing to your hotel and I ca nt speak highly enough of her professionalism and demeanor truly delightful. Moving on the hotel grounds are beautiful the club is definitely worth paying the extra for a great array of food and drinks. We traveling in a group with children so the lounge is only accessible for 15hr in the evening a little disappointing however understandable especially if your not traveling with children and want a peaceful reprieve from a busy day. Food is fairly good I only had the breakfast buffet once within the week and was not overly impressed however it was towards the end of the time but it was overly chaotic and all the food in all the areas needed replenishment. The egg lady on the other hand was incredible she was able to send out eggs at a speed I have never seen before. Club breakfast did not make it too but I imagine fairly good. The Bake house in the foyer is very good the girls are loverly make a great coffee and the French delights were outstanding. Gym ExcelentNegatives and constructive Criticism. Kids Club an additional cost the inside I can understand however the children splash play should most defiantly be accessible for kids all day. Its not overly large but good enough to break up the view of the pool all day. Pol You need to have music playing it lacks any kind of atmosphere.

Whilst we spend considerable amounts of money around the pool we would have spend hundreds more along thousands around the pool if the service was far more efficient. The staff were very nice so not a criticism about the staff themselves but the volume of staff and the slowness between food and drinks needs to be improved. Lifeguards These are probably my biggest gripe with the hotel whilst they are there to administer life saving skills for a time in need they a few of them are more like police from eastern Germany not just with my family which can all swim but many guest they need to be reminded guest are just that guest they are not school children and this is how many were treated in our observations.

This visit has upset me in many ways. 1. After my 12yr old son and I checked in on the 14th I got news that my 16yr old son whom I had not seen for 15 years was joining us as a surprise on the 17th. I asked reception if the twin beds could be joined or we could have an extra roll out bed. I was told the additional cost per night was SGD90. I was taken aback by this high price difference but obviously had no choice but to accept the extra cost. The alternative was that I could not accommodate my sons visit. When we returned to our room after picking him up from the airport there was no roll out bed. I had to call to ask for it. We then had a series of 4 delivered the last being at almost midnight. Having entered random dates and compared 3 adults to 2 adults in the same room I can see that the maximum difference comparing all rates is SGD 60. This opportunism leaves a bad taste in my mouth. 2. I asked in the lobby restaurant if I could please have a copy of the menu to take back to my mother in the UK as a memento of her nephew. I explained to your member of staff that the menu included mention of the Coconut Club partnership with the Shangri La and my cousin who co owned the Coconut Club had recently passed away at just 40 years old and we were so very proud of his achievements. It would have been kind of your staff to fulfil such a simple request for a printed copy of the menu to take back to my mother. I was shocked when the waitress said no and after pleading said that she must consult with her manager. She returned to our table after some time to simply say that the answer was still no and it was not possible. Without explanation. I asked if the manager could reconsider and the firm response was no. My children and I find this incomprehensible. I would like to know the reason please. It was a piece of paper. Which no doubt gets re printed when damaged or the menu changes. May I ask why we could not have a copy. What is the detriment to the Shangri La if a menu was given to us. 3. I was working on my laptop by the pool when hard rain came down. I asked the pool staff who each had umbrellas if there was a spare umbrella for me to get to the Line entrance without being soaked. I was told no no umbrellas and they turned away. I remember when Shangri La pool attendants would automatically walk with and cover guests with their umbrella until they reached the Line entrance.

With a separate big shower cubicle and bath tub the experience was so much better. Only comment is the writing table chair feels slightly uncomfortable when I sit there to watch TV. The housekeeping service was fast and responsive whenever we requested for any extra amenities. The breakfast was so great with so many choices of fodThough we did not use much of the hotel facilities such as swimming pool and health centre hope my next stay can be more immersing in the hotel facilities. I must commend highly of your reception officer Ms Sherie who had assisted us not just on her efficient and warm check in and also with advice especially for my wife with shopping ideas and places. Ms Sherie actually still recognised us whenever we are in the lobby. That personal touch was just wonderful she and my wife just got on fabulously which is special considering the size of the hotel and the many guests that you have. The concierge and front door staff were all so efficient and polite.

The breakfast buffet was the largest we have ever seen. it is just not huge but very well chosen articles and the quality was excellent. Only complaint about the breakfast is the coffee service. You can make much better coffee by yourself using Nespreso machines which are available there. Room and bathroom very nicely renovated. Only complain in that sector comes from the age of the hotel. Almost 50 years ago room height was lower and there is not enough natural light in the room. One thing I suggest is please remove those large writing desks which are totally blocking the windows and takes the last spacious feeling away. The incoming experience was one the best. Whole lobby level staff is so awesome. Every time we were around there someone noticed us and came to talk. There was no difference who was it. Everyone in there behaved the same. Final conclusion was the late checkout until 5 pm combined with afternoon tea service. It was really nice to stay at hotel premises when our flight left just before midnight. Also the lobby atmosphere and design makes blissful feeling. Then the garden or how to describe that paradise around the pool. Funny feeling to be few hundred meters from Orchard street and totally inside a forest. Shuttle was a nice addition though it might go more often and directly to Orchard MRTWhen we wandered around the hotel we thought that this would be a nice place for a family vacation if you have kids.

My wife and I have stayed at the Shangri la every two or three years since 1987. For many years it was the hotel of choice for professionals especially when staying in the Horizon Club. For the extra cost one got excellent well appointed rooms and a degree of exclusive service in the breakfast and Club areas On our recent trip we found that the room had been redesigned probably by someone who had never stayed there. The bathroom is smaller with the shower in a so called wet room area with a slippery floor which could be dangerous. A former feature used to be the full size bath tub in which one could relax but this has been replaced by a small steep sided one which is difficult to get out of. For some reason a small induction hob has been added to the entrance area. The kind of people who used to frequent the Shangri la are happy to pay to eat in restaurants and do not want the smell of cooking in their bedrooms. We requested twin beds but were given one enormous double bed. Breakfast is now only served in the Line restaurant next to the pool. This is self service sitting at plastic tables. There is nothing wrong with the food and the choice is enormous but the atmosphere is similar to the concourse at Victoria Station in London but with a few extra screaming kids. Gone are the white linen tablecloths and the smiling service. Similarly the Club lounge no longer has friendly waiters carrying bottles of wine to top up your glass. The wine comes out of a self service dispensing machine. The staff are efficient but impersonal and many of them have poor language skills clearly not Singaporean. The atmosphere remains outstanding at the Italian Waterfall restaurant with well prepared food well served and accompanied by a wide choice of wines.", "offset": [1031, 1100], "date": "2020-03-22 00:00:00", "cpt": "4", "category": "pool"}, {"id": 40, "uid": "d2aed149-4aa2-4364-a792-046f23ddbddb", "sentence": "My grandchildren enjoyed so much at the new outdoor children pool but there are areas that may cause hazard the children who get excited and start running.
