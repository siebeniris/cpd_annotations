There were six of us in our party 2 toddlers 2 adults and 2 seniors. The hotel amenities were varied enough for everyone to find something to enjoy. Pool with 3 foot shallow end good for toddlers and hot tub Fire pit. Excellent for enjoying your evening mai tai at the pool side Beach access. Not really suitable for swimming but fun to play in the sand and get your feet wet. Beautiful. Makes a great backdrop for your vacation photos. there is also an outdoor shower to rinse the sand off your feet before returning to the pol Great location. Longs Drugs close by. Within walking distance from restaurants grocery stores etc. Activities desk. Very helpful. Rooms were modern and comfortable. We had a lanai balcony overlooking the pool area and the beach.

My fianc\u00e9 and I have stayed at Courtyard Kauai Coconut Beach twice before. We had initially found it appealing due to the reasonable price and the central location of the hotel to the island. The first two times we were given a warm welcome and loved the ocean view room. The decor and physical state of the room were dated but the rooms were well taken care of and clean. We stayed for 8 days and enjoyed our Mai Tai \u2019s by the pool in the evening after exploring the island during the day. The daily resort fee always seemed a bit pricey but included 1 free Mai Tai per person per night. The pool is relaxing as is the hot tub especially since it is so close to the ocean. The only problem that we ran into the during these two trips 2015 2016 was we had a difficult time finding a dryer that worked which we needed before our flight to avoid wet swim suits in our bag. Our 2017 trip to the hotel was very disappointing in comparison. We were still greeted kindly upon arrival. We spent the bulk of our time exploring and enjoying the island but we we noticed that the beds were not as comfy as the previous trips and the room and hotel were definitely showing more wear and tear then previously. Also the daily resort fee remains the same however now only includes one free Mai Tai per person for the entire stay. We also noted that although you pay a nightly parking fee finding a place to park is almost impossible the nights they have the onsite Luau. This is unacceptable. Overall the price of the hotel continues to rise as the quality of the hotel has decreased. We will be returning to kauai this summer but will be staying at a more accommodating and updated retreat. The two most upsetting parts of our stay helped us in realizing that the hotel was not worth another visit. The hotel has a number of tables in a common area near the pool away from the restaurant. We had previously eaten dinner in the area with takeout from local restaurants. During our most recent trip a waitress approached us and asked us \u201c What are you doing at My table \u201d. She then shared that we were not allowed to have outside food at Her restaurant. Startled my fianc\u00e9 noted that this table was open and due to its \u2019 close proximity to common spaces we had assumed that it was not a part of the restaurant. In a very negative and loud voice the waitress said \u201c These are my tables and you can only sit at my tables if you are going to order from me \u201d. At this point everyone at the pool and other tables were all facing us and watching. We decided it was not worth arguing and took our dinner to our room. It should be noted that the waitress stood next to the table with her arms crossed and waited for us to leave. We found this to be upsetting and did not return to the restaurant for the remainder of our stay. The final event that turned us away from the hotel was on our third to last day of our stay. We were getting ready for bed and my fianc\u00e9 could n\u2019t find his prescription Oakley glasses. We looked everywhere for about an hour and they were no where to be found. We called guest services and let them know and they apologized and said they would check the lost and found. They were very kind and let us know that they did n\u2019t find anything but would call if they did. We called the last day just to see especially because they were expensive but were told nothing showed up. It should be noted that he never removed the glasses from the room. Our housekeeper was very sweet but perhaps the glasses were removed with bedding and the glasses were lost. The last few days at the hotel were disappointing and we left with a negative experience of the hotel. Although we have positive memories of our first stay the final trip was too upsetting to want to return to Courtyard Kauai.", "offset": [619, 703], "date": "2018-04-14", "cpt": "0", "category": "pool"}, {"id": 8, "uid": "f55360a2-bb7f-43a3-ae8a-06d34ea6d4d0", "sentence": "Wondeful view from our room outdated interior but not bad amenities good pool and hot tub.

First of all I find it interesting that I am unable to leave a review on the Mariot site. Apparently you have to receive a survey in order to do so. So I am leaving the review here. Like many others I booked this stay without being aware of the construction. I was informed of the construction via a email confirmation a week before our trip. There is major construction and the entire pool area is closed. I would not have chosen this hotel had I been aware of the construction. Shame on Mariot for not having it posted clearly on their website for the hotel. Once I knew about the construction I called the hotel and requested a newly renovated room away from the construction noise. I will say that our room was nice with a good view of the ocean. We were on the very south side and never heard construction noise in our room. The hotel is trying to a good job despite the construction. Positives 350 Mai Tais until 6 pm. Chairs Lounges set up along the beach it is a lovely beach to look at but not good for swimming. Pool access at the neighbor hotel we did not use it but it was not crowded and looked nice. The resort fee of 200 a day was a bit of stretch but it included free bikes beach towels chairs etc. In summary if you are able to get a great deal on this hotel and just need a place to sleep I would say to go for it being fully aware of the construction. We enjoyed sitting on the beach in the evenings and were out and about on the island during the days. Plenty of nice restaurants in walking distance and very conveniently located to Kapa town and both sides of the Island. If there is no cost savings pick another property.

No breakfast included and pretty much we should have been thankful that we had a room there. Very unpleasant and rude welcome to this hotel.

Our lattes had different price every day although our order was exactly the same. The kids juices usually were served at the same time with the bill at the end of breakfast. Rooms I can not quite picture where the remodeling part was. The rooms needed a deep cleaning for sure it felt like whatever they have remodeled they just left and forgot to clean up before allowing people in. The beds are very soft and uncomfortable the pillows are extremely soft do not understand the purpose of it. The daily cleaning service included just the fix of our beds and fresh towels. For the 4 of us they were leaving only 2 towels no matter how many times we requested them to make a note that we need four. One or two towels every day had some kind of stain spots indicating they did not clean them properly. The hotel is on the windiest beach on the island. The beach is nice but you can not really enjoy it due to the wind. The wind never stopped for the entire time we were there. This might be a reason to the tree to be so leaning away towards the hotel. The beach is windy the pool side is windy as well you can not find a place to avoid it no matter where you go. The fire pits around the pool are lovely in the evening but again with so much wind is hard to enjoy even a single drink. The tiles around the pool the breakfast restaurant and the lobby was quite slippery. There were a lot of signs about that but that can not prevent slipping.
