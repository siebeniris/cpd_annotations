The Chatanogan has been a favorite hotel of mine for a few years since we first stayed there. We make frequent trips to Chattanooga from Atlanta just to stay here. The rooms are very nice as is the entire hotel. It is tastefully modern contemporary with out overdoing it. Rooms are nice. I have stayed in 540 most recently. it is a king room with a city view. Floor to ceiling windows are nice. The room appears to have just recently been refurbished as the furniture all looked brand new. I have also stayed in courtyard suite which was also very nice. It has a fancier bathroom with a large tub. Facilities are all clean and well maintained. Indoor pool is always a highlight. The Foundry and Broad St Grill have good food and great service albeit a little on the pricy side. Only real downside is that there are very few other restaurants within walking distance. Otherwise it is 5 stars.", "offset": [518, 581], "date": "2015-01-03", "cpt": "0", "category": "room"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "a9b5cf80-3b79-42b1-a33d-b636c49e58ce", "sentence": "Great value and convenient stay.

Highly recommend. Very nice hotel in pretty much every way. Valet us are super friendly front desk staff are quick friendly. Rooms are nice comfy clean. Water pressure is serious in the shower haha. The spa is on the 2nd floor they offer massages such this is also where the pool is located. It is indoor really just a splash pool it is only 312 feet deep. There is a hot tub too. The pool chemicals are very strong which is good for germs but be aware. We read in one review not to stay on the 2nd floor because of the spa it would be noisy we were on the 2nd floor had no problems. Guess it just depends on who is at the hotel. The restaurants in the hotel are nice. Breakfast is a big buffet it is not included but that is to be expected this is not a holiday inn express it is a nicer upscale hotel with lots of banquet rooms even a small amphitheater. The chef waiters at breakfast carry on chit chat they were very funny. The towns free shuttle that runs every few minutes has a stop about a 3 minute walk from the hotel. We used that but we also just walked to the aquarium area which was about a 2025 minute walk through town. We really enjoyed it we would definitely stay here again.", "offset": [138, 165], "date": "2015-06-14", "cpt": "0", "category": "room"}, {"id": 4, "uid": "36a43ec3-447a-491a-8937-bba6088beb4a", "sentence": "My only choice in Chattanooga. The Chatanogan is so much more than a hotel. The hotel itself is very comfortable and has the best guest service. The front entrance has a park like setting.
