Overall we were not happy with our visit and would not return. The hotel had several areas of renovation and repair going on that were accessible to guests and were unsightly to view such as an area of the hallway ceiling that was literally falling down on the first floor behind the pool area and secondly the lack of an on site restaurant was also an issue. We were traveling with a small child so the pool was important and that was fairly clean and he enjoyed swimming in it. The jacuzi needed some attention because it was not pristine in its cleanliness nor were the bubblers working properly. We notified the staff but nothing was done. The hotel offers a breakfast if you pay 14 per person per day and that was not acceptable to us. There are TONS of awesome restaurants nearby that we went to for breakfast but the convenience was an issue for us and we would not stay here again based on that as well. Especially with kids it is so convenient to just go to the hotels offered breakfast even if it is just basic and get stuff for them to munch on to start their day. The cost of the hotel was not insignificant we paid 150 for a king bed room. so the added cost for the routine hotel offered breakfast fare was not something we were interested in. Honestly there are so many other hotels nearby that you could easily find something a bit better than this location. The staff were as accommodating as they could be but they are not working with a great property. The staff was as accommodating as they could be but the property is not up to par.

Since this is a new hotel and only 1 review I will be even a little more detailed than usual. It was a Radison years ago then independent and now it is DoubleTree I think since August 2019. The renovation is very nice pool room bathroom shower only in mine bar gym conference rooms common area. The strange thing is the air conditioning vents and panels are still rusted and not fully closed in the hallway and in the room. Some of the window door glasses are still kind of dirty. Stair cases are outside. Housekeeping is the biggest issue I experienced. When I got to my room the toilet seat was down usually they are either closed completely or up. When I flipped it up there was a urine stain on the bottom of the seat toward the front. The toilet paper was not folded like hotels usually do. The tissue paper was already showing blue almost finished. The bag with the hair dryer was dirty. There was also some stains on the sofa. So housekeeping really needs to improve. On the subject of facial tissues it is the cheap kind that falls apart as you use it DoubleTrees should use better quality tissues than that. Service was kind of uneven. I called before arrival to see if they can help me choose a better room. The person who answered the phone said every room is good and did not seem to want to help. Upon arrival the front desk offered me an upgrade me to a suite without me asking because of my Diamond status. Except for that employee who was not very patient or extra friendly I also interacted with her at the hotel every other employee I encountered was nice and want to go the extra mile for guests at their new hotel. The hotel is L shaped. Part of it is right next to the I10 exit ramp. Then there is also the hot Arizona sun to consider. Somehow the Hilton Ap did not show a map of the rooms. The even numbered rooms face inside the L and the pool. I had a room that faces the pool and the noise from people at the pool does travel up. Could not hear the freeway traffic so that is good. Breakfast is kind of fast casual buffet style supposedly the new DoubleTree Made Market concept. Food quality is decent comparable to other DoubleTrees and price is reasonable 1295 adult 5 kids for full buffet. There is also a nice bar in the lobby. No lounge for Diamonds very few DoubleTrees doThe location is kind of out of the way for Phoenix Tempe Scotsdale.
