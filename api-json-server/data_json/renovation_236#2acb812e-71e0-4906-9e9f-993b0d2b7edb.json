I stay and Mariots and Ritz Carltons all over the world. I recently stayed at Grand Cayman and Lake Tahoe Ritz Carlton hotels. and this past Friday night had the opportunity to stay at the Buckhead Ritz. The location is great being directly across the street from two different shopping malls with incredible stores and restaurants. You can walk to these malls and do not have a need to get your car out of parking. Please realize that the valet parking is 36 a day which is quite expensive. The hotel itself is in need of a renovation in the rooms for sure but the beds are quite comfortable. My room was a corner room and had great light and views but was quite hot. and we could not get the air conditioning to cool us at all during the day. The thing that sets this place apart from the other Ritz Carlton hotels I have stayed at was the Club level staff. They were far and above the best and most personal club level staff I have had at any Ritz Carlton anywhere. The food and drinks there were amazing and I the decor and furniture were quite comfortable and inviting. If I were to decide to go back the hotel I would do it based on the club level alone but would have to make sure that the room I was staying in had better AC so I did not wake up sweating all night.", "offset": [556, 657], "date": "2015-05-17", "cpt": "0", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "a8d5da9f-63a2-4b9d-b447-e32f28adc9d2", "sentence": "Luxury and location.

Housekeeping 010 Who removes bed linen before someone checks out. And while we are at it maybe dust the vents to we do not have ducts filled with dust balsDirectors. 010 While they apologized for the events the response was also littered with arrogance by suggesting the events were Not to your expectations to suggest I was being picky when in fact no guest should be effectively forced out of a room by having their bed linen removed. They also made up reasons for the issue including maybe they were remaking your bed well in that case they only did a half baked job. When told they were making excuses the Dir of Front Desk said he was brainstorming and not making excuses but clearly thinks throwing out ideas constitutes brainstorming vs logical conclusions. Overall the apologies were insincere by placing onus on me and my expectations which are what any guest would wantOn top of that they offered goodwill points an amount I consider small for the circumstance and did not actually post them something that does not surprise me at alLong version I decided to stay at this hotel and regret my choice based on how it ended and how a Dir replied to my complaint re. housekeeping removing the bed linen even before my checkout resulting in me checking out earlier than expected since I could not grab a nap before leaving. I arrived back to hotel after a morning of sightseeing to discover the bed linen removed. I received flimsy excuses from guest services and another Dir about how they were refreshing the linens but had not finished. to perhaps they thought you were checked out my belongings were still in the room. I voiced my displeasure and sent an email to the GM per his email only to get a Dir of Rooms suggest multiple times that recent stay did not meet your expectations. and we can mutually anticipate your expectations. To be honest no guest would be satisfied but the email suggests the fault lies in me being picky who would not expect bed linen on a bed during their stayWhen questioned on why the staff would remove the linen if they thought I had checked out despite my bags being in the room was ignored suggesting to me that this really was an excuse for bad practiceFinaly they were going to deposit a lowball offer of goodwill points but true to the lack of professionalism they never materializedI would not stay here again given the poor treatment I had at the end of the stay as well as the unprofessional response I received post stay.", "offset": [1722, 1847], "date": "2018-05-11", "cpt": "0", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 7, "uid": "426059c7-acfa-4ca1-9abf-5bb1d0b8b037", "sentence": "Disappointed. My experience started with making a reservation on the SPG site. While making the reservation I checked the Box provided for early check in. What I found out was at this hotel does not permit early check in even when the room is available. In fact an early check in will result in a charge of 12 day. I have never had an experience where my room is actually available and I was not permitted to check in early. A first. Why would the website offer such a preference if it would not honor it. Secondly this is an old hotel. I heard staff talk about the renovation to come but in its current state it is an outdated frumpy Hotel. The bathrooms in the rooms on the executive club level are tiny and they do not have a walk in shower. But for the great towels and bath accessories you would think you were in a 2 star hotel.

We just returned from a weekend stay at the Whitley. I decided to book the Whitley over some other accommodations after reading all of the positive reviews. First of all the location is terrific. Right across the street from Lenox Mall and very convenient to all Buckhead restaurants. Yet our first impression of the Whitley was not very positive. Upon arrival the check in line was very long. When I finally made it to the check in desk the process was smooth and the attendant was pleasant. They also accommodated my request for a lower level room. The negative came when we arrived on our floor. First of all the hotel is very old and the first impression after getting off the elevator was that it smelled old. My child actually compared it to the smell in her grandmothers nursing home. When we arrived to our room we were very disappointed in what we thought would be a luxury hotel. The room smelled and the carpet looked very old. Also there was a serious lack of detail in housekeeping. The bathroom trash had not been emptied and there were dirty marks on the white bedding. When I tried to call the front desk to let them know the attendant said she would call the front desk and ask if they could move us to another room. No apology just let me see what I can do. She called me back and said that a bellman would be up to our room shortly to help us move our luggage down to the hallway to another room. After half an hour or so the bellman finally arrived and just handed us the room key. No offer to help us move and again no apology for the inconvenience. We had a family of four so we had several bags to move with no cart. The positive was that the new room was much cleaner and smelled better than the first one. The negative was that once again there was a lack of attention to detail. Only 3 bath towels for 4 people. We called the front desk and they said that they would send extras right up. After 30 minutes of waiting we finally just left and grabbed some clean towels from the pool area. So frustratingThis hotel will be undergoing a major renovation soon so hopefully this will help solve the outdated and smelly room situation. The housekeeping problem is a different issue.
