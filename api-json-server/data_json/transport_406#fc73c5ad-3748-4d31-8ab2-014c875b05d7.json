The hotel was very conveniently located from downtown Miami Beach and Coconut Grove which were the places I visited while in town. There was a great bar in the lobby that was frequented by guests and visitors and there was also energy in the place with all the people and activities. There is a good outdoor swimming pool off of the main lobby which also kept busy. The hotel has ample parking but if you self park you have to meander from the parking garage to the hotel entrance maybe 50 to 75 yards. However I will not complain as I booked with my Triple A and received complimentary parking which saved us over 60 for our stay. Our room was great and was updated with carpet and furnishing. If you are a runner as I am the hotel was conveniently located down from the causeway which led to Miami Beach.", "offset": [724, 835], "date": "2015-01-28", "cpt": "0", "category": "transport"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "208a2c8c-9ce9-4263-88d0-4fa8c2571f80", "sentence": "Excellent spot in downtown Miami. I stayed in January 2015 for business for one night. This is an excellent sopt in downtown Miami. I was in a corner suite and the view was spectacular. The hotel has a lovely location since it is very close to many of the downtown attractions including the American Airlines Arena bayfront Park and Museum Park. The hotel is also close to a small shopping center which is helpful for late night needs. The hotel was reached easily and cheaply by taxi from the airport. Left luggage was no problem at all. I very much liked the check in which was friendly and efficient. Also the executive lounge was well stocked had a nice view and friendly staff.

The room was great with an all glass wall facing the Miami Bay. I took great pictures on a sunny day. Valet parking was always quick and friendly. And the location of the hotel is ideal for going out downtown in the Brickel area or to drive to Miami Beach all is within a few minutes drive even in heavy traffic. Price performance ratio is ok.

I have been a very long time customer to the Hilton Brand and a long time Diamond Member. Although some weekend housekeeping issues did arise Mr Amury Diaz Night Manager was very quick to handle the situation and Make It Right. Kudos to Mr Diaz for all his help during my stay.

My Wife and me stayed at Hilton downtown as i am a Hilton Honours member an we were in Miami to attend a friends marriage. The hotel is located near the hustle bustle of Miami downtown and is a very good option as it has many restaurants and Grocery Shops near by. We stayed here in May 2016 and the hotel was undergoing renovation but the hotel staff made sure that if any issues encountered we do let them know. The rooms very not that big but not that small too. We had a KING BED BAYVIEW room which had good views of the bay. The hotel does charge for the parking which is 28 a night a bit on the higher side. The bay at valet for guests is decent enough to wait while the valet brings up the car. The roof top pool is very nice with views of the downtown and have a bar starbucks on the same level. A lot of activities are available nearby for adventure seekers namely Jet Boat Miami. Its a mere 10 mins walk fron the hotel.

I spent a week at the Hilton Miami Downtown on business. The hotel is undergoing significant renovations which can not help but impact guests experiences. A had a renovated room on the 8th floor which was spacious and well appointed and for the most part the staff that I encountered throughout the week were polite and helpful. The only thing preventing me from giving a higher rating is the very limited overpriced and unappealing dining options in the hotel. it is understandable that renovations will cause a certain amount of disruption but in my opinion charging 23 for a buffet breakfast in a stark converted meeting room does not say sorry for the disruption. Luckily The Daily Creative Food Company is a five minute walk down the street and they offer excellent food with great service at a fraction of the price. As for other posters comments about the neighbourhood I had dinner at a few local restaurants and never encountered any problems.

Upgraded our room Hilton Honors to a water view which was unexpected and very much appreciated. First 10 floors are newly renovated so you probably want to ask for a room on floors 1 10 while they work on the others.

VIEWS VIEWS VIEWS. it \u2019s a gorgeous hotel but there \u2019s not too many things to dazzle you here with. We got there around 7 pm and were taken into the downstairs lobby. There were plenty of people downstairs to direct us up the elevator so that was no problem. Once we got upstairs we checked in with no problem. The lobby is beautiful. It \u2019s modern and gorgeous. Up the elevator we go and get to our room. It \u2019s just a standard room. It was well updated and clean but a bit of a let down after that lobby. The bathroom was the nicest part. Lets talk about the view this room had. Spectacular. We decided to go exploring and saw the roof top pool which was as great as it sounds. We then wanted to venture to the Grand after hearing there was a walkway. This is where it got weird. We had seen ONE sign that it was on a certain level so we go there and take a guess to walk outside to the parking garage. We then take an elevator walk across the dead garage walk through the creepy sky walk to a building that looks like an abandoned mall. There were stores downstairs but the whole thing was really strange. Also there were a maximum of two signs the entire way. Anyone could get lost and I \u2019m not sure how you would feel walking around at night alone. Another problem was the elevator. When checking out it was almost impossible to get and elevator. All were super packed. Some people would ride it up just to eventually come back down. When I was booking this hotel I asked if there was a shuttle to the cruise port. They said there was and that it was 6 person. Not a huge fee so we were okay with it. When we got there though no one mentioned the shuttle and when we asked there was some confusion. We ended up taking an uber which was 15 for 5 people for 3 person. I think a hotel of this caliber should offer a complimentary shuttle or at least a cheaper one. When checking in they gave us the information for the wifi. When we got to the room the wifi was n\u2019t working. After 15 minutes of frustration we called the front desk and they explained that wifi was only free in the lobby. How does a hotel in 2019 not offer free wifi. Even low end hotels in the middle of Times Square offer free wifi.
