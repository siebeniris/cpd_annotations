Overall an average experience but because it is the Four Seasons that still means it is better than most other hotels. Of course it should be given the price tag of \u00a3 500 plus per night. The positives it looks and feels like a typical beautiful Four Seasons. The first impressions are excellent. The management who have been shipped in from different Four Season hotels are also typical top notch staff. The negatives at the lower end of the staffing equation waiters cleaners etc the overall standard is very poor. Room cleanliness a torn curtain in the Four Seasons. not a big deal but indicative. Cold hot food at buffet. Taxi ordered and then late for a business meeting as bellman and front desk told contradictory stories about contacting my room. No one called. Waiting 5 minutes to catch a waiters eye for a coffee at breakfast despite hand waving. Then ordering coffee and nothing happening twice in a row. Definitely not what one expects at the purported best luxury hotel group in the world. And why they can not just leave coffee pots on your table at breakfast as they do at other Four Seasons I just did not get. Fire alarm causing an evacuation at 6 am 3 hours sleep. I do not care about the false alarm these things happen especially in Dubai. But the management of the issue was appalling. No fire marshals guests waiting on tennis courts in the dark and then wandering into the lobby whilst alarm still going of our own accord because we did not know what was happening and then guests being asked to wait in reception without any advice info all whilst staff blithely went on checking in new arrivals. In mitigation when these faults were pointed out to management their response was very positive. But the blunt fact is that in a 2 night stay such things should not happen in such numbers.", "offset": [1343, 1656], "date": "2015-02-27", "cpt": "0", "category": "facility"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "b0c91cf5-8b7c-4de6-95e1-4852bbb3843a", "sentence": "Disapointed. The Dubai property is quite far from the regular Four Seasons standards. I travel to Dubai every month for business I usually chose the One Only because I feel like home every time. Due to the nature of my business I travel a lot world wide. If available I am choosing Four Seasons for all the extra things that I get there amenities gifts and complimentary services. This months I stayed for 3 nights in Four Seasons Jumeirah Beach because I was curious about the Dubai Four Seasons. The building is nice it looks like Madinat Jumeirah but smaller and with less outlets. The beach experience is awful the water is dirty and quite near there is construction working in progress which means a lot of noise and bad view. The internet speed is really bad but this is a common issue in EMEA region. The difference is that here for crappy internet I had to pay about 100 USD but luckily after negotiation they waved half as a sign of good will. Still it was quite expensive for that bad connection. As a matter of fact they are limiting the number of devices which you can connect. The room experience there was enough space in the room but the bad was not that big. I am a 65 tall person so I had some problem with my feet getting out of the bad the hot water was actually warm and not even all the time the AC was making a strange noise during the quiet time the bath tube was a joke especially for a man of my size. For the rate that I paid I expected to have a nice Jacuzi but I did notSlep quality I am a business man I need to have a nice and peaceful sleep but I faced several disturbances apart from the AC noise due to the fact that even though it is a resort it has 2 night clubs with very loud music until 2 or 3 in the morning and near the property there is a mosque which is quite disturbing at 5 in the morning. A part from all these there is some working in progress to the road which passes near the building so both the noise and the view are awful. In my first day I had a room close to that side of the road and apart from all the above mentioned I was able to see and to hear the staff who were smoking right under my balcony. luckily the moved me to a different room closer to the roof top club noise. Pool experience was not that bad the design and the landscape are nice but the service is not great. long waiting time for a drink more than 20 minutes for a beer some Arabs were keep on saying something about a Medallion survey and some construction noise coming from the fifth floor. Dining experience. Both Coya and Nusret are amazing I am definitely going to come back for diner no mater where I will sleep. Regarding the staff I can say that I was really impressed by some of them Darya from the front office succeeded to nicely calm me down every time 1 for that as I know that I am. the instructor from the gym Vladimir the big guy was a real professional regarding to body training I also had some bad experience with some staff members from front desk and pool area. I do not want to give names as most of the employees were looking very stressed and tired anyway. So as a conclusion overall I would only recommend Four Seasons Dubai for those two restaurants Coya and Nusret but not for accommodation.", "offset": [3105, 3242], "date": "2015-03-12", "cpt": "0", "category": "facility"}, {"id": 2, "uid": "fc598ba7-1cd8-4641-9fc4-a194bdc5ab96", "sentence": "Poor.

Upon our arrival we were greeted by passionate and energetic guest service team especially Zhou. Attentive service by providing us with chilled waters. Gorgeous lobby full of stylish decors with a classy lounge. A bit off from public transport guess it was built to be exclusive not for budget tourist. One must take either taxi or pre booked transport to visit the city. Around 15mins drive from Burj al Arab and Burj Khalifa. 25 mins drive from airport. Professional service from Concierge Alexandra getting us everything ready for the tour to Atlantis and very useful tips. Nice and spacious room design quite similar to Paris George V yet with stronger hints of arabic feature. Huge balcony though a bit empty. They did provide a yoga mat inside the room a plus. Our bathtub was tremendously decorated with patels very gorgeous and impressive. Thanks to the housekeeping team for that. Etro toiletries were quite a plus to us. A blemish is the provision of dental kit which is only upon request instead of pre setup. The hotel is equipped with 3 different pools 2 outdoor 1 indoor a must to try. They got their own beach lovely for couples. Will definitely come back if I get any chance.

This was my second time to Four Seasons Dubai. Other than sprinkling rose petals to walk on I am really not sure how this hotel could be improved. The building is immaculate the staff are impeccable going above and beyond the call of duty to help at all times. Check in staff personally escort you to your room. Special thanks to the Suq Manager Lawrence who was such a lovely guy with fantastic hospitality. The chefs willingly take individual requests at breakfast without hesitation. The spa was super although the girls on the front desk were a little stuck up but improved with conversation. The Serbian guy in the gym was absolutely brilliant really knew his stuff and was so accommodating and helpful. The pool staff cleaned our sunglasses the concierge were fantastic too and every part of the stay was just incredible. Will never stay anywhere else in Dubai and I am already looking forward to my third trip there. Everything. Location will be perfect when the island and canal are finished.

The facilities are amazing immaculately kept and the service is fantastic. The staff is what really makes the difference here everybody from the catering staff to the porters to the doormen to concierge and the reception everybody is really attentive professional and warm. Despite being a huge property the service is very personalized and everybody seem to be genuinely nice. In some occasions I felt there was some magic in it as the staff tended to preempt my unspoken needs a lot. I really felt at home.
