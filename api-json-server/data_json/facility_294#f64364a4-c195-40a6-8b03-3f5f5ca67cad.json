A staff misinformed my husband that there was a pool on the roof. To our disappointment that was not the case. In any event the hotel lobby is nice and big. Very tropical feel. The rooms were a little dated. My bathroom had a crack in the sink. The floors looked like they needed work and the toilet had brown rust. I called housekeeping the second day to clean the toilet because i thought it was something else but it was just dried rust It does not look good to the eye. The carpet looked shabby as well. On the bright side the beds were comfortable and we had a view of the ocean. Housekeeping staff was very nice. in fact the entire hotel staff is friendly except the guy who checked us in. As for the restaurant. Well breakfast was good. Dinner not so good. The view is nice i think that is why people give the restaurant high ratings. I sent back my food once and when the saffron rice came so salty I just could not eat it. Please ask about the childrens juicesoda. We were told 4 different prices. No one bothered to mention that the soda was free with the kids meal. hum I wonder why. The beach area was clean. However i wish they would update the shack where thy keep their towels and toys. It does not represent a four star hotel at all. My daughter had to crawl under the wooden shack for a toy. I just shook my head. Overall it was just ok.

This is one the first few hotels where the property started on the ocean side of the A1A blvd making it having it is own private type beach all beach are public. From lobby you can also enjoy the sunset over the Intercostal waterway and sunrise from the room balcony. All balconies above 2nd floor are private. Second floor has a wide shared almost a patio type balcony and each room has it is own awning. one caution about beach in fort lauderdale beach has a lot of rocks. Hotel and city tries to clean it up each morning and continuously literally one guy I saw went in the water to pick those rock up. But even with all these efforts both my wife and I almost cut our feet. So not your sugar sand Bahama beach here. Water is very clear with occasional sea weeds in it. Enough of view and beach. Room itself has a nice decor with iron framed bed high ceilings and separate living room with sofa and a small dining table. I wish sofa was not made of polythilyn. Rooms furnitures need updating there were worn pieces and doors. Carpet and floor looks old and worn out completely. Beds were okay to sleep in but mattress also needs to be changed. Service I would say was mixed. Cleaning services were bare bone even after tipping them. I had to ask each time to vacuum the floors. In room dining service by Mike was great but the food was nothing to write home about. Food was consistently nothing special we tried it both in room and at the restaurant downstairs. Waiting service at the restaurant was also just okay. Food lacks seasoning and usually are over done. How can you get eggs to be like plastic. Steak and fish was too salty. Reception often time gives out conflicting information such as for our late check out request we got three answers at from three different clerks. First one the night before check out told me something about not having enough allocation open so asked me check after breakfast next day. Next in the morning another clerk said that it is okay till 1 pm and after that there is a 50 charge to stay until 3 pm. So we checked back and we were told no way we can be here past 12 pm. After we mentioned about the option for paying 50 he had to check and get okay from the manager. should not there be a consistent well layed out process. Valet service was exelent even with occasional delay in getting the car. Most of the time I got it within 5 minutes. There is also a gift shop and spa service within the property. Last if you want to visit fort Lauderdale I would recommend this hotel for the view and amazing beach experience. Otherwise this is more like a 3 and half star facility.

If you are looking for a upscale beachfront resort and have no concerns about cost then this is the place for you. Ocean is literally 50 yds from back end of resort. We had a 5th floor ocean front suite with an unsurpassed view. Suite had two separate rooms one with king bed and tv. Second room had sofa chairs small table with seating tv hidden microwave and small fridg. Second room has door opening to an outside balcony. Both rooms were well appointed though some of the furniture was showing some wear. View was spectacular both day and night. Bedding was excellent among the best we have ever encountered. TV reception was good with an adequate number of channels. Bathroom was off first room and was clean and functional. We did have to call for maid service one afternoon. We found the entire resort both outside and inside to be exceptionally clean. In that we were there during the off season the beach was not crowded at all. Water was very warm and very smooth. Beach is considered private as only one other resort nearby. Towels and umbrellas are available from hotel employees stationed on beach. Pool was warm and had daytime attendant on site. On the downside this resort is not for everyone. If you have concern with high resort costs fees or quality food then you probably are better suited in another location. Daily resort fee plus tax is 30 while daily parking fee is 33. Biggest disappointment was the food. After traveling all day we arrived in the evening and visited the bar for drinks and a meal. A signature cocktail draft beer and two sandwiches amounted to 55 plus tip. We waited over 1 hour 15 minutes to get our food. The server apologized on two occasions for the tardiness and said they were super busy despite the bar being almost empty. Another employee informed us the resort had cut down on some of the number of employees for the off season. The cubano sandwich was very lacking as it contained little meat and the fries were few. We did try the main dining room for lunch and found the burger to be a good value but the two fish tacos were tiny and came with a 14 price. We were later informed the menu was being revised and a chef from Noble House was visiting on site making improvements. The resort has somewhat of a captive audience when it comes to food as there is only one hotel just to the north with the Sandgril Rest. within one mile. We ate breakfast there one day. It was very good and a little less expensive. They do a good amount of business with Pelican Grand customers. We did take a short cab ride 8 to the Galleria shopping center. They had several good rest. as well as the Blue Martini nightclub. well worth the trip. The ice cream shope added a nice touch to the resort. Good variety of items and collectables. Snacks again were a little expensive but the convenience was worth it. Taxi from the airport was 29 while the resort van back to the airport was 35Loking back we had a great trip at a fabulous resort.

We stayed here as part of a wedding party last weekend and the place was quite nice. The rooms were spacious and ours had a balcony with an ocean view. The hotel restaurant was very good especially the breakfast menu. The wedding reception was a formal sit down meal and the food was very well done. If you spend some time at the pool be sure and look for Brian Brown. He took great care of us all day making sure we were set up and comfortable.

One of the best hotel experiences of my life. I traveled here as a long overdue girls trip with my sisters mom and aunts. Starting as soon as we pulled up to the Pelican Grand we were treated phenomenally. They accommodated our extremely early check in with a smile and then blew us away with our room. We had a beautiful room with an unbelievable ocean view. Everything was sparkling clean and so comfortable. The Pelican Grand feels so boutique. it combines beautiful Key West old Florida aesthetic with modern cleanliness and amenities. The staff went above and beyond to provide us with a resort experience and always with a wonderful attitude. One of our favorite experiences was sitting on the beach front patio drinking coffee and watching the sun rise. That and exploring the incredible view from the roof top. Truly a wonderful place to stay we \u2019re already planning our next trip back.", "offset": [474, 565], "date": "2020-01-24", "cpt": "3", "category": "facility"}, {"id": 33, "uid": "69ceb732-297a-42a7-9b91-a5d654b3f6fb", "sentence": "Our favorite Pre Cruise Hotel. We have been cruising out of the Fort Lauderdale Port everglades for 20 years now and have stayed in many Ocean side hotels from fort Lauderdale to Sunny Isle Fl. over the years. We discovered the Pelican Grand Hotel 4 years ago when looking for an ocean side beach hotel resort to stay at the day before our cruises that was a little away from the busy tourist scene. a little further down the fort lauderdale beach we found our new pre cruise home at the Pelican Grand. The historic look and bright colors of the exterior instantly grab you attention and almost transcends you back in time to when things were much slower and tranquil. We instantly fell in love with the charm and perfect location. As you arrive you are welcomed with a freindly greeting and great service to assist you with your luggage. Upon walking into the main entrance of the hotel you are visually met with bright yet warm colors that feels very comfortable and welcoming. We always stay in a ocean side king suite with beautiful views and fresh breeze of the Atlantic Ocean. directly out the back of the hotel is a well manicured freshly combed beach just footsteps away from the ranch style porch where you can sit and enjoy drinks meal from either restaurant on site and enjoy the warm ocean air and the sound of the gentle rolling waves as they roll onto and away from the sandy beach. The Staff has always been very friendly and welcoming. Added benefits of the pool and lazy river as well as the spa on the top floor of the hotel. My Bride and I enjoy a couples massage every year to start our cruise vacation off perfectlyPriced a little higher than other hotels in the area but you get what you pay for Highly recommend.
