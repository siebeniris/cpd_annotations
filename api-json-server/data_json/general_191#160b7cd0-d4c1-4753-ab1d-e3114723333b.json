Hotel was beautiful. The rooms were a good size and very well maintained. We had an Ocean View in the Club tower. We were in the furthest tower but did not mind. The food was great in the Club Lounge. So WORTH the money. We would have spent way more not having the Club access. The entire staff at the hotel were amazing. A few people that stood out. Jamal at the pool. Diaz and Maria in the club lounge. I was so amazed at the customer service. We loved having access to the paddle boards snorkel stuff small sail boats. I know the price of that is included in the resort fee but it was nice not having to pay extras when you wanted to use it. This hotel had a little of everything. There were a lot of couples and families. I have 3 kids but left them behind. I would have maybe liked to see a different pool for say adults who did not want to be around so many kids. Location. So close to Red Hook. About a 5 min taxi ride which was 5 a person. Red Hook had good restaurants and bars. Beach was ok but the area around the pool was so nice I did not mind. There are other beaches that you would want to venture out to see anyways. Spa Not impressed at all with the spa. I have been to much nicer spas.

We had a resort view but could see the pool and ocean. The room was clean spacious and nicely appointed. We had an oversized balcony which we put to good use. The bathroom is lovely. One complaint the sound proofing could be improved. The people above us were very noisy and we felt like they were in the room with us. The service was amazing. I did not feel like we were on island time or that we were being rushed it was the perfect balance. The staff knows that we want to order and eat and get back to the pool and beach. The beach amenities were amazing. The staff were always available and eager to help. Snorkeling right off the beach was so easy and we saw a lot of interesting marine life. And the free ice cream treats and cookies at 330 were my kids favorite part of the day. The following constructive criticism is meant to be helpful in improving the resort and is not meant to be negative. need some more breakfast options in Zest like a fruit cup or even some bananas or apples. Night life was a little lacking too. If there was entertainment at Sails or outside at Bluewater it ended at 9 pm. that is too early. Showing movies at Zest for the kids was great but need a bigger venue with better screen and sound system. And lastly thank you for supplying bug spray. Just remember to pack the anti itch cream.

I really do not like giving average or negative reviews especially in this case because the staff is super kind. I just feel like the hotel needs to be aware of some things. First of all we had a very welcoming greeting when we arrived. We were brought drinks immediately upon our arrival while we checked in. After check in they gave us an additional. It was a sweet gesture to start our stay off right. During check in we were told that we would be given a 200 resort credit per night because the hotel still is not completely finished. This was a great surprise and a very kind gesture. We were in Puerto Rico staying at the St Regis over Christmas before we came here. it is hard to not compare the two. We read TripAdvisor reviews on this hotel and our expectations were not very high so being told we would be credited was a very nice surprise. We arrived at our room and while it was okay it was not anything fancy. Much smaller than the room we stayed in at the St Regis. Beds were comfortable and we had a deck which was nice. Although the Ocean View room we had was more of a view of the construction of the pool. We did not spend time out there since it was mainly construction. As for the shower in the bathroom it seems odd that it is frosted glass that you can see into the main room. So you can see someone showering or at least the shadow of them. There was also light from the shower so if others are still sleeping in your room its not dark. Being a Ritz I would have expected better. The first night we ate at Coconut Cove. Nakita was our server and she was very friendly. My husband ordered a seafood pasta with Lobster mussels clams and shrimp. My daughter and I had the chicken pasta. The chicken pasta was absolutely delicious both my daughter and I loved it. As for the seafood pasta there was no lobster and barely any mussels or clams. It was mainly shrimp. When my husband questioned it the manager asked the chef and he said he was out of lobster. That is fine but they should have told us that because it was 14 more for the lobster. They offered to take it off our bill but my husband said no it was still good and since he ate it he suggested to just charge him like it was a chicken pasta which they did. I am only pointing this out because of what happens a few days later which I will talk about below. The guys and gals working the pool were super friendly and helped get your chairs set up. Christmas is a busy time but we never had issues finding chairs. There were plenty. Lunch at the pool took over an hour to receive which seemed like a long time so just order before you are too hungry. Most restaurants require reservations before you arrive because when we got there they were all booked for dinners. The breakfast buffet restaurant near the pool was good although you could tell the wait staff were extremely stressed and overwhelmed. The second day we ate here there was quite a wait. We told them we would be waiting outside and they said they would come out and let us know when our table was ready. As we saw people behind us in line getting seated my daughter went up and questioned and the lady was not very kind and said we have been calling your name for awhile. My daughter quickly reminded her that we told her we were waiting outside since there was no room to wait inside and that she agreed to come out to tell us when our table was ready. They sat us next. New Years Eve lunch we decided to eat at Coconut Cove again because we wanted the chicken pasta. Nakita was our waitress again and we were happy to see her. My husband ordered a bacon cheeseburger. She asked what kind of cheese and he said swiss. She came by our table shortly later and my husband questioned if saw that it said bacon on the cheeseburger. She said he was accurate and there would be bacon. So out comes his cheeseburger and my husband jokingly said this is the orangest swiss I have ever seen. Nakita felt bad and said she would take it back and fix it immediately. My husband told her no it is not a big deal he likes cheddar too. She leaves and my husband realizes there is no bacon. So when she comes back he tells her and you can tell she is completely embarrassed. She brings the bacon. My husband then started eating the burger and after a few bites he realizes there is something in his burger. Sure enough it was the wax paper that divides the cheese. He calls Nakita over and she looked mortified. She asked to put it on a plate to show the chef. My husband was done eating at this point. When our bill was brought to us we thought for sure they would take his meal off especially since my husband did not have them take off the pasta off the first night like they asked. We thought it was only fair since he had wax paper in his burger that he be comped that. So he scratched off that part of the bill and did a new total. When we received our final bill we saw that they did make the adjustment on their end which was good however it should have never been on the bill in the first place. That night we went out to eat in town. When we came home there was a bottle of champagne and a very kind note from Nakita. That was great customer service and they definitely tried to right their wrong. We were thankful for that even though we do not drink champagne. On our last morning there we had to get up early for our taxi and when I went to shower I realized the staff that serviced our rooms forgot to leave us any fresh towels. They took all of our old towels during turndown service but forgot to leave new towels so we did not even have hand towels. It was about 7 am and I called housekeeping and they never answered I called the front desk concierge and they never answered. Since we all needed to be up and showered it was quite frustrating no one answered their phones. I had to call the bell desk to ask for towels. They said they would be right up. They arrived at 830am. Luckily our flight was delayed by several hours so it was okay it took them so long for the towels to arrive. I do feel there should always be someone available answering phones for guests though. We were eaten alive by the sand flies so be sure to use the Off they have for you near the pool. My daughter stopped counting at 100 bites on her body. Red bumps welts that were super itchy. Ok back to the good. The water is beautiful there is coral and rocks in the water but we still got in and my son and husband did some snorkeling. That was fun for them. The sand is super soft and when you are not looking at the pool construction the view is stunning. I loved looking out to St John. I would return. I just hope they get some of these kinks worked out soon especially when I had to use more than the usual points for our stay for a hotel that was not quite ready.

Although the Ocean View room we had was more of a view of the construction of the pool. We did not spend time out there since it was mainly construction. As for the shower in the bathroom it seems odd that it is frosted glass that you can see into the main room. So you can see someone showering or at least the shadow of them. There was also light from the shower so if others are still sleeping in your room its not dark. Being a Ritz I would have expected better. The first night we ate at Coconut Cove. Nakita was our server and she was very friendly. My husband ordered a seafood pasta with Lobster mussels clams and shrimp. My daughter and I had the chicken pasta. The chicken pasta was absolutely delicious both my daughter and I loved it. As for the seafood pasta there was no lobster and barely any mussels or clams. It was mainly shrimp. When my husband questioned it the manager asked the chef and he said he was out of lobster. That is fine but they should have told us that because it was 14 more for the lobster. They offered to take it off our bill but my husband said no it was still good and since he ate it he suggested to just charge him like it was a chicken pasta which they did. I am only pointing this out because of what happens a few days later which I will talk about below. The guys and gals working the pool were super friendly and helped get your chairs set up. Christmas is a busy time but we never had issues finding chairs. There were plenty. Lunch at the pool took over an hour to receive which seemed like a long time so just order before you are too hungry. Most restaurants require reservations before you arrive because when we got there they were all booked for dinners. The breakfast buffet restaurant near the pool was good although you could tell the wait staff were extremely stressed and overwhelmed. The second day we ate here there was quite a wait. We told them we would be waiting outside and they said they would come out and let us know when our table was ready. As we saw people behind us in line getting seated my daughter went up and questioned and the lady was not very kind and said we have been calling your name for awhile. My daughter quickly reminded her that we told her we were waiting outside since there was no room to wait inside and that she agreed to come out to tell us when our table was ready. They sat us next. New Years Eve lunch we decided to eat at Coconut Cove again because we wanted the chicken pasta. Nakita was our waitress again and we were happy to see her. My husband ordered a bacon cheeseburger. She asked what kind of cheese and he said swiss. She came by our table shortly later and my husband questioned if saw that it said bacon on the cheeseburger. She said he was accurate and there would be bacon. So out comes his cheeseburger and my husband jokingly said this is the orangest swiss I have ever seen. Nakita felt bad and said she would take it back and fix it immediately. My husband told her no it is not a big deal he likes cheddar too. She leaves and my husband realizes there is no bacon. So when she comes back he tells her and you can tell she is completely embarrassed. She brings the bacon. My husband then started eating the burger and after a few bites he realizes there is something in his burger. Sure enough it was the wax paper that divides the cheese. He calls Nakita over and she looked mortified. She asked to put it on a plate to show the chef. My husband was done eating at this point. When our bill was brought to us we thought for sure they would take his meal off especially since my husband did not have them take off the pasta off the first night like they asked. We thought it was only fair since he had wax paper in his burger that he be comped that. So he scratched off that part of the bill and did a new total. When we received our final bill we saw that they did make the adjustment on their end which was good however it should have never been on the bill in the first place. That night we went out to eat in town. When we came home there was a bottle of champagne and a very kind note from Nakita. That was great customer service and they definitely tried to right their wrong. We were thankful for that even though we do not drink champagne. On our last morning there we had to get up early for our taxi and when I went to shower I realized the staff that serviced our rooms forgot to leave us any fresh towels. They took all of our old towels during turndown service but forgot to leave new towels so we did not even have hand towels. It was about 7 am and I called housekeeping and they never answered I called the front desk concierge and they never answered. Since we all needed to be up and showered it was quite frustrating no one answered their phones. I had to call the bell desk to ask for towels. They said they would be right up. They arrived at 830am. Luckily our flight was delayed by several hours so it was okay it took them so long for the towels to arrive. I do feel there should always be someone available answering phones for guests though. We were eaten alive by the sand flies so be sure to use the Off they have for you near the pool. My daughter stopped counting at 100 bites on her body. Red bumps welts that were super itchy. Ok back to the good. The water is beautiful there is coral and rocks in the water but we still got in and my son and husband did some snorkeling. That was fun for them. The sand is super soft and when you are not looking at the pool construction the view is stunning. I loved looking out to St John. I would return. I just hope they get some of these kinks worked out soon especially when I had to use more than the usual points for our stay for a hotel that was not quite ready. Once the family pool is completed it will be great.", "offset": [4494, 4542], "date": "2020-01-16", "cpt": "2", "category": "general"}, {"id": 26, "uid": "5350798e-09ae-4138-b70a-e84df0ea0336", "sentence": "Gorgeous with wonderful staff. First let me state the obvious this place is absolutely gorgeous. I love the open air concept throughout the lobby common spaces. The breeze is constant wonderful. The decor is luxurious w out being stuffy. Being greeted with a rum punch during check in while taking in the sweeping view of the property turquoise bay from upstairs is SO cool. The water is amazing. That blue you see in movies but not in real life. it is here. Also Hobie Cats snorkel gear paddle boards kayaks included in mandatory resort fee so use them. We visited a couple of other beaches during our stay and they had way rougher water. The bay at the Ritz was by far our fave. We did not eat much on property we like to sample the local fare as much as possible but did order the chicken quesadilla twice. Spicy generous portions delish. there is a grocery store down the road for basics at decent prices including wine beer liquor plus a few close restaurants bars. Nothing within walking distance though. But cabs are quick affordable. And on that note we rented a car but never even used it. wasted. Unles you plan to really explore the island do not bother. We had planned to do some exploring but decided we just did not want to leaveSome issues we had that should be mentioned our initial room was bad just the location all the rooms themselves are beautiful. we are Titanium Elite w Mariot. Highest tier possible. And no upgrade available to water view during checkin. that is understandable no guarantees we get it. But this room happened to face the back of construction with crews hanging out smoking and arguing. yelling right outside our balcony. Not acceptable no matter your status with Mariot. That room should not have been an option for anyone period. However a few phone calls later Sylvester made it right. We had a choice between 3 rooms all with gorgeous ocean views. Just unfortunate we had to waste those few hours initially upon arrival. The construction not that bad. they are putting in a great new pool w a slide we really were not bothered in the least aside from that first room. In fact I think it is completed by now. Just want to mention b c other reviews haveSo the island was pretty devastated by two Cat 5 hurricanes back to back in 2017. Can you imagine. you had never know it to look at the Ritz property. However recovery is ongoing everywhere else even other high end hotels. But they have come a VERY long way in the past 2 years and the residents we spoke to were super proud of the progresThe music can be annoying pumping from the speakers by the pool when you are trying to fall to sleep by the sound of the waves. It was bad loud the first day. Better the next few days. But I read other reviews saying the same thing. Just fyi. Saving the best for last the STAFF. Particularly Aaron. Charles too. Aaron made our stay above beyond more personal. he is got a gift for hospitality he is smart genuine and at his young age will no doubt go far but selfishly we want him to stay at this location. The first day he greeted us as we approached the beach and got us completely set up with awesome shaded chairs towels and a whatever you need promise. And we had no cash to tip. Not that he expected one. The next day the same service. And every day after that. He went above beyond a number of times. Always with a genuine desire to elevate our vacation as much as he possibly could. And he had also hang out with us IF he had a spare minute and we had chat about normal stuff. Not only did Aaron take care of us every day AND everyone else as we witnessed but we became friends and we genuinely miss his company. Charles was a complete delight also and we loved chatting with him. He has a happy persona that is infectious and he never failed to put a smile on our face. He also went the extra mile in hospitality every time we interacted. His enthusiasm for his job was apparent. it is personal connections like these that make a vacation trip more memorable more special and resonate for a lifetime. Overall we had highly recommend this location for a relaxing beach vacay. It has everything you had want including a 247 amazing infinity pool that we never dipped a toe in. Did I mention the super friendly stilt walkers. Free cocktails snacks in the evenings polside this happened at least 3 times. Sea turtles swimming next to your Hobie. Breaching manta rays right in front you as you swim. Local kite surfers doing amazing flips out in the bay. Sister property the club side. right around the corner that has another gorgeous beach more pools food and hot tubs. And nowhere does it feel the least bit busy even though we were in the high season. Yep it is pretty great. Next time we are bringing the kids.

The Verdict. This is a nicely remodeled Ritz with well appointed contemporary rooms though would not call them overly spacious some solid food nicely manicured grounds and a pretty infinity pool. That said this hotel has two glaring problems. First its located on a pretty underwhelming beach. If you love the sound of crashing waves the sight of crystal turquoise water and soft white sand on your feet this is not the resort for you. Pretty to look at but ultimately more of a small bay inlet. Pool lovers will likely have no problem here. Secondly the service was pretty hit or miss. We expected this given its a recently reopened resort of this size but disappointing nonetheless. Some highlights. Roms grounds and pool area. Food was solid for a beach resort we liked Aloro Staf is warm and mostly accommodating. Olivia in Guest Relations was wonderful. Arranged all of our restaurants spa transfers etc in advance personally oversaw our arrival checked in with us throughout our stay. But onto the issues Club We had a pretty unfortunate experience here. I will say it is been nicely remodeled. But as it turns out as a Titanium Bonvoy tier you actually DO NOT have access. After being warmly greeted by the staff we were enjoying a glass of wine before dinner when confronted by the Manager asking for our last name. I told her and continued on not thinking anything of it. She clearly went to cross reference and came out to the deck to loudly inform us that we in fact do not have Club access. Sure this was our mistake though Titanium typically gets this perk in the US. She then offered to call the front desk to charge our room 300 night if we would like to keep enjoying during our stay. It was really the delivery that got us upset she was not terribly rude but everyone heard around us and it was embarrassing. Its a 5Star hotel we were n\u2019t trying to sneak into the Club. She offered we could finish our drinks after telling us the hotel is not classified as a US property its in the USVI \u2026. Felt nickel and dimedPol Chairs. I think this is just given they expanded the pool area but the pool furniture should be nicer than beach chairs. They \u2019re not uncomfortable but you just do n\u2019t feel luxury when sit ing in them. AC units in rooms are loud maybe not replaced with remodel.", "offset": [1723, 1847], "date": "2020-03-03", "cpt": "2", "category": "general"}]}
