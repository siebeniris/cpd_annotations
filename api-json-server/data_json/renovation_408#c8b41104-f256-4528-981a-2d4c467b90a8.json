However it is VERY expensive and the rest of the hotel facilities do not really justify the cost. The rooms are small and the bathrooms are in need of a renovation. The food is also very over priced.

Our family travelled from Sydney to Disneyland Anaheim and stayed for five nights at the Grand Californian hotel. Our son is 5 and our daughter is 7We were worried when we were notified that the hotel was under going renovations and while we were there the pool area was closed and boarded up. Other than that we were not impacted by the renovations. The service is excellent. This hotels service was better than the service at the other resorts we stayed at on this trip. The location is extremely convenient and we loved being able to go quickly back to the room from within California adventure park and with a shorter walk from Disneyland than any other location. This was particularly helpful as we found some mornings cold and it was great to be able to go back to the room and drop off warmer clothes. It was also very convenient to be able to change out of wet clothes on some of the rides where you get wet such as the grisley river run which is extremely close to the hotel. We had a fantastic trip. Everything about the hotel and disneyland was fun. Our kids loved the character dining at the story tellers cafe. It is very expensive but an awesome exprience for those who can afford to do it. We found the breakfast at the hotel to be the quickest way to get the kids up and out to the park for the day and our kids were totally in love with the characters. I found Story Tellers Cafe the most relaxed of the character dining venues perhaps there were less people staying in the Grand Californian due to the renovations or perhaps it is a larger more efficient venue. We dined early as we were keen to get into the park and never had a problem getting a table. We took the shuttle to disneyland hotel for a swim since the grand californian pool was closed it was good although I was surprised to find there were no showers there which meant we came back a little wet in fairly cool weather. We also used that shuttle to attend character dining at goofys kitchen and mickeys grill at the other hotels which was a great experience. I had assumed if we were impacted by the renovations we could relocate to the other hotels we were nt impacted and definitely felt we were staying in the best hotel. The actual hotel room is fairly basic for the money. I had some problems with the shower not being hot enough which was surprising for such an expensive hotel. I asked for this to be addressed and I am fairly sure it got better after the second request but still not as hot as I would like. I can see why they are renovating. For the money I would think a refurb is worthwhile of course it might be naive to assume they will refurb and not increase the prices. We requested a bunk bed and this was granted. Compared to other hotels we stayed at such as great wolf lodge and legoland the bunk bed provided the least amount of privacy for us. A curtain or alternate room design could enhance the guest experience by putting the kids out of the line of sight. I found the lowest setting on the rooms air conditioning to be a bit too powerful for my preferences. Our kids loved the cartoons playing in the foyer I do nt think they have seen anything like it. I liked the bar and the service available downstairs to relax once the kids went to sleep. I found the staffing levels to be excellent especially compared with other resort hotels. Getting wake up calls from Mickey mouse and these small details enhanced the experience for the kids. Over all while it is one of the most expensive ways to experience disneyland we loved our time at the Grand Californian. It was the trip of a life time for us so to speak and while I would love to keep costs down next time it is so good I ca nt rule out staying there again.", "offset": [2112, 2277], "date": "2017-04-26", "cpt": "0", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 8, "uid": "608f14de-d1be-42f5-957b-0c9ba0e56f44", "sentence": "Great Stay at the Grand Californian. This is a great hotel. Many will argue that this much money does not correspond to the hotel itself. you are buying location and ease of access to the park. I have a 25 year old who really needs a nap at least once during the day and an escape from the park. This place is CLOSE and easy to get in and out of. it is currently under refurbishment and all the pools were closed except one as of the day we left May 16 2017. It looked as if they were getting CLOSE to opening another one soon though. They offered a shuttle over to either the Disneyland Hotel pool or the Paradise Pier pool which we did not take advantage of but I could see running back and forth at regular intervals. They have currently restricted access to entrance to the park California Adventure from the Grand Californian to just guests of the Grand Californian Hotel. This did not used to be the case. I would not get too worked up about it as going around to the front entrance for your magic morning entry takes approximately the same amount of time if you do not get to the entrance an hour early to line up. We stayed in a Premium View room which had already been renovated so it was done really nice. They had USB charging stations in several outlets so all the familys devices could be charged up if need be. The view from a premium Park view room I made a special request to be able to see the WOC is quite good. It will NOT take the place of being in the park for it obviously but it really is quite good if you want to enjoy an outfield type view from your balcony while relaxing and dealing with the evening wind down. I would stay again but whew it is PRICEY. Generally I do not pay this much for Hotels unles they are far higher end.

Lets start with location just in between California Adventure and Downtown Disney and steps away from the monorail for easy access to Disneyland. The location can not be beat. Walking into California Adventure easily escaping to your room within minutes its great. The hotel is undergoing refurbishments and I will stay away from that topic as it is temporary. I will say though that the new rooms are lightyears ahead of the old rooms. I saw pictures especially the bathroom and wow. The new rooms are modern safe for babies and the bathrooms have been totally redone. As you enter there is a handy space for your stroller just adjacent to the connecting room door. Then you have a closet Keurig coffee machine that sits on top of a fridge great if you have breastmilk or other foods to store. A desk makeup area a dresser and a super cool sofa that turns into a kids bed finishes off that side of the room. NOT a typical sofa bed this thing was legit. Our room had two queens which was fine we asked for a king but none available. Got a pool view on second floor which was nothing to write home about. I would recommend park view or do not care what you get. do not spend money on pool view. The beds were elevated off the ground with ample storage underneath for goodies including large suitcases. The hotel brought us a pack and play with sheets for our little one it BARELY fit between bed 2 and the window. I m sure in a king room there would be more room. They offer cribs but those were substantially larger. They do not guarantee these items but they told me that they have never run out. There are double sinks with storage shelves and storage underneath. Bathroom sinks are in their own area but out in the room. The lights do not bother those that sleep but no door to sink area. Toilet and shower are behind a pocket door. The shower complete with seat and multiple shower heads was amazing. No bath tub. You might think this is a bummer for kids maybe so but our 1 year old loved it. Electronics did not watch TV who has time for that at Disney. There are plugs GALORE. four above night stand four USB ports and dimable uplighting in a wall sconce that ran the perimeter of the room. The lighting was SUPER nice dim bright whatever you wanted it was nice. Over at the desk there was another bank of plugs and USB ports. More plugs at the bathroom sink. I m not sure you could use all the plugs and they were all high up off the ground again baby safe. We just let our little 1 year old run around and he was totally good. Only one trash can in the room you run out of space quick. They do not change your towels out if you hang them up. Rooms are pretty quiet very dark with black out drapes. Light on the smoke detector was SO bright at night. Bring a little piece of gaffers tape or duct tape for it if you are light sensitive. Room service was good ordered twice. At at Storytellers cafe for breakfast 90 for buffet for 2 people yikes it was expensive. Pools were all closed so I can not review them. All of the staff was really nice again the location was great. They allowed us to do a late late checkout where we paid a half room rate to check out at 5PM. Stayed in the park in the morning then napped then packed and left. Worked out perfect. Obviously this is subject to availability. Check in is slow. They really do not have rooms ready till check in time but will text you when ready. There is a viewing deck on the 6th floor for the World of Color show but it was pretty dismal. You are at such a poor angle. Sound is piped in but we could just imagine that being down in the park would have been SO much better. I would not wast your time standing up there to watch it. Make your way into the park.

After the second night we phoned them to which they asked what is that noise in the background when we explained it was the renovations they immediately accommodated us to a different room suddenly no longer full. The hotel is very nice but the staff are ruined the experience. Management did not care with a what did you expect the hotel is under renovation. My issue is that if they had just been honest and said we can not guarantee you will not be impacted when we booked I would have booked a vacation elsewhere.

Overall we really enjoyed our stay at this hotel. We spent three nights here and visited the parks for three days. You can not beat the location of this hotel. You have a private entrance into California Adventure and a private entrance into downtown Disney which is about a 3 minute walk from the main Disneyland entrance. From the time we left our room on the third floor to getting into California adventure it was literally under 5 minutes and the walk to Disneyland from our room was probably 5 7 minutes door to door. You ca n\u2019t beat that In terms of the actual hotel and the rooms I thought they were nice. Everything has been renovated and the level of service and security particularly when you arrive was fantastic. The rooms are nice but nothing special however I really liked having double sinks and the toilet shower being separate from the sinks so two people can get ready faster in the morning. We did not eat at the hotel and only ate in the parks. I would recommend this because you \u2019re so close to the parks already and the hotel restaurant pricing seemed high. In terms of overall pricing for the room I do think it \u2019s high but it \u2019s all about setting your expectations prior to arriving. You are paying for location and a hotel that has been fully remodeled however your actual room is a standard size room.

The Grand Californian has gotten increasingly expensive and is probably not the best value. However if it is within your budget andor if you have really young children it is hands down the most convenient and best option for Disneyland Resort. I have increased the overall rating from 4 stars to 5 stars this time around because Disney did an excellent job with its recent remodel of this hotel. The rooms are brighter better designed and seemingly more spacious due to improved layout. As has always been the case this is by far the most convenient hotel to the parks. I can not stress this point enough. If your children are older or if you are childless Disneyland Hotel is a better overall value. It is definitely farther to the park entrances but it is less expensive has better pools the service is just as good and the rooms are also nicely themed and spacious. Other than proximity Disneyland Hotel is more or less on par with the Grand Californian save for personal preference. Paradise Pier while a good value is not in the same category. Do I think the Grand Californian Hotel is overpriced. Yes quite. Would I stay there again. Yes but probably not during peak periods at full prices. Although I am fortunate enough to be able to afford the full price I still would not spend 70 on a room. it is simply not worth it for what you get which is essentially a 4 star or 45 star hotel.

Thousands of reviews on this property but heres my take after at least 5 visits over the last 3 yearswhat is great Location. Your own gate from the hotel to CA Adventure and a very short walk to Disney. The Disneyland Hotel is MUCH farther to both parks. The only reason I would stay at the Disneyland hotel again is for the pool. Fun slides and a more tropical atmosphere. Every else is better at Grand CA in my opinion. Best part about staying here is you can come back and rest in the afternoon use the pool and then be back in the park in 10 minutes. Huge upgrade not the experience Remodeled rooms. Big upgrade with the remodel in 2017. Rooms are modern and well appointed. Great bed and awesome climate control. If you want to sleep in 65 degrees the AC will do it here. Rooms are also very quiet and well insulate from noise outside your rom Dining Napa Rose is one of the top rated restaurants in all of Orange County so from fine dining to food for the kids you will not go wrong here Atmosphere for being in the middle of Anaheim you can almost buy into the lodge decor. The lobby in really impressive and makes you feel as though you are a world away once you step through the big doors from the driveway Staff All Disney properties are great in this regard but folks here really seem to go the extra mile to make your stay amazing. Sugestions They have many room categories here. Some of which are much more expensive than others for the same room just facing a different direction. In my opinion paying extra for a Downtown Disney or Park view is a complete waste of money. Downtown Disney is noisy very late. And specifically the shuttles to from the parking garage honk twice before they leave let me tell you this gets old if you are in the victim. Park view can be really crummy as in looking at the machinery of a ride in CA adventure. After trying almost all of them I think WOODS VIEW is the best room and best value. These can look into the courtyards around the hotel or even out toward CA adventure but usually with trees between you and the park. Usually very quiet and nice to sit on the patio. Disney is great.
