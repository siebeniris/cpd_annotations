Over the past 17 years my family and I have been staying at the Sheraton for a total number of 12 stays. Prior to our latest stay February March 2105. I researched some of the reviews just to see if things had changed and to help with our expectations. Obviously the location has not changed and it is still the best feature of the hotel. The beach is so convenient for swimming and snorkeling at Black Rock it is as good as you will get even compared to the paid snorkeling tours. you will see a large variety of fish and several sea turtles lots of fun to watch. you are also conveniently located to the beach walk path. You can walk jog run about 15 miles to the north toward Dukes and 13 miles south toward the Hyat a total of 57 miles roundtrip from end to end. Easy walk to Whalers Village for shopping and restaurants too. The pool is great. Some will say it is cold and that is true if you go directly from sun bathing to the water. But once you get use to it it is fine. it is also fine if you come right from the ocean. you will want to find the bean bags that are floating in the pool and use them to lounge as you float the lazy river. Guests will reserve lounges by putting towels etc. on them early in the morning. There are notices telling guests not to do so but it is not enforced so the practice continues. you will also find many non guests using the lounges during weekends this is also not enforced. So you might have to compromise and not have that perfect sun bathing location. it is not too big a a problem just some thing to manage your expectations. The rooms and the entire facility is clean. The grounds are immaculate. We typically get an Oceanfront room and have a great view of the beach. It can be confusing when trying to select a room there are Oceanview Partial Oceanview Ocean Front Deluxe Ocean Front. it is best to look carefully at the resort map on the website. We have found that rooms on floors 5 and 6 tend to have narrower decks. The 4th floor seems to be a sweet spot. you will read in some reviews there are bug insect problems. We have never found this to be a problem although there is note in the room to ask guests to keep the sliding door closed to help control peststhere is lots of choices for dining at the Sheraton and we have not been disappointed. Typically we eat at places other than the Sheraton more for the variety and experience. But when we do eat at the Sheraton we find the service to be great. Many of the breakfast staff have been there for the 17 years we have been visiting. There is a three course dinner menu that is a good value at 45 each. I had read some reviews that the front desk staff is not very friendly. This we found to be true at our most recent visit. But what was more disappointing was the inconsistent information they would give to new guests checking in. For example some staff would ask how many towel cards you wanted and another staff told us we could only have two. When I asked for four cards he was very reluctant but eventually gave me two more and told me if I lost one it would cast me 15. really. The check in is only a 10 minute experience so I was not going to let it ruin our two week stay still it was not very welcoming. Will we go back.

In Experience Tarnish Our Stay. We stayed here over New Years. Overall the facility and the staff were great but our check in expereince nearly ruined our stay. We booked through a travel agent who suggested since we were in Hawaii island hopping for 10 days thay we should save some money by getting one room with 2 queen beds for my wife 18 and 22 year old kids and myself. Afteral we were not there to stay in our room and we were getting a condo when we got to Kauai. So when we arrived they were understaffed at the check in desk and my wife waited 30 minutes until it was her turn. Then she was told our room only had one king bed. She explained our reservation which was made in July was for 4 adults. She was told they could provide us with a roll away. She explained that was not acceptable. She was told that is why she should not use a thrid party travel agent and should have booked direct and a room for 4 adults is just a request made by the travel agent and did not guarantee 2 beds. By the way our travel agent has booked dozens of rooms at this hotel. Have one of your kids sleep in the king bed with you and the other can sleep on the roll away. There were no other rooms available. We asked to speak to the manager and he said he was the manager. Eventually one of his employees overhead the discussion and said she had a room with 2 queen beds. He seemed reluctant to offer the room but finally relented. The room had an obscured view of the ocean versus what we had reserved but at least we had 2 beds. He was condescending throughout the process and never showed any empathy. I travel a lot and have never had an expereince with a front desk approaching this experience. We contacted our travel agent who contacted the Sheraton. We eventually received a VM apology from guest relations which I think was a weak response for the horrible customer experience we had. The rest of the staff we encountered from the restaurant bar cleaning staff was all very positive and the facility was very nice. it is too bad that one employee the manager soured our entire experience.", "offset": [70, 167], "date": "2016-01-14", "cpt": "0", "category": "facility"}, {"id": 4, "uid": "05e2a028-c8cc-4f8a-a2bb-a1bcab2dc829", "sentence": "Honeymoon.

My stay here did not start off well. I was visiting for a wedding and had booked 2 rooms. Somewhere in between booking the room I applied for an upgrade and somehow this made the hotel think I was looking to cancel a room. It might have also been booking two rooms at the wedding rate I never did figure it out. So when I showed up I had only 1 room to sleep 5 people. After about an hour on the phone with corporate and having the staff try to come up with a solution they put me up at the westin villas up the street for a night. The next day they were able to get my second room sorted out and our family was able to be near each other the rest of the stay. The facility director Carol was amazing in getting things sorted out for me. The hotel itself is very nice it is split across 6 major buildings at various elevations. There are lots of rooms with views of the ocean. We had an ocean view room with a patio and it was nice and very relaxing. Getting around the hotel can take a bit of time depending upon where you start. eg if you are in the 60 rooms to get to the lobby its walk from 60s to 500s 3rd floor. Take elevator to 8th. walk across 8th which is the top of black rock to other side. Take elevator to 1st. walk across courtyard to main building. Take elevator from G to L. Walk to lobby. The breakfast at the hotel was quite nice. Lots of fruit pears in sauce yogurt granola etc. I did notice that if you were there too early eg70 that the quality seemed a little off but overall everything was good. Its also important to note that there are 2 shuttle routes. 1 shuttle that goes between the 3 starwod properties route 2 and 1 that also goes into lahaina route 1Nearby. less than a 10 minute walk is also a mall with a variety of stores and restaurants.

We were quite happy with Sheraton while not perfect we enjoyed our stay and would recommend it. Property Location. Loved the open air lobby. Check in was easy and friendly. The property is lovely and the location is good. We saw rainbows everyday. It is situated right on a great beach \u2026 Ka\u2019anapali and near many restaurants walk in medical services and shops including several in walking distance. We loved having the nearby black rocks to snorkel and jump off. We enjoyed the nightly cliff diving ceremony that we watched from our balcony. Lahaina and it \u2019s harbor is nearby with many excursion options as well as loads of great restaurants and shopping. The shuttle is free to Lahaina as well. We did not eat at the property except for a quick lunch at the Dive bar by the pool and beach. The server was friendly but the food took forever to come out. Holiday week. One time we waited for a table to become available and ended up leaving when we were told it would take 45 minutes for the food 4 burgers. We went next door and got take out and ate that on the beach instead. Way cheaper too. see belowRoms Our 2 rooms had nice views over the lawn to the beach and black rocks. The rooms were clean and attractive. The beds were comfy toiletries were nice and the bathroom was bright. We made use of the in room coffee maker and safe. Gym Once you find it it is ok. Was small but fine for our use. The signage was confusing. We had to go up to floor 8 and then down to 7 or something like that. kinda crazy. We actually had to stop for directions a few times. After a few days and we figured it out \u2026 and then we were asked daily to give directions to others so I know it was n\u2019t just us. Quite confusing. Our room was at the far opposite side and was as far from the gym as possible so if you are closer this may not be a problem. On the plus side I appreciated the large bathrooms and lockers with showers amenities etc \u2026 Pool Was cold. During Christmas week the pool was crowded and it was hard to find a chair. Lounge chairs on the beach or shaded chairs by the pool are charged extra. We often saw the public not staying at the hotel were using the pool taking towels off of lounge chairs etc \u2026. Kids were not supposed to be in the hot tub it was overcrowded with kids splashing etc. and made it unpleasant. During Christmas week the property seemed a bit overwhelmed. garbage pails were over flowing. While not being a big problem it was disappointing to see. Parking Rental cars Parking was free for one night. We chose to self park the rest of the time to save money. We found renting a car was helpful to explore the area a bit. It is n\u2019t a must though if you are at the Sheraton since they have a shuttle to town restaurants and shopping and much of that is in walking distance. Of course there is also access to cabs. We used Uber quite often with much success. Nearby Whalers Village is a good choice for cheaper food from the food court take out as well as shopping. There are some nice shops including high end retailers. It is a 5 minute walk from the hotel or a free shuttle bus ride. We liked the Acai bowls at the food court for breakfast and thought they were far cheaper than the Sheraton breakfast options. We also made use of the take out options from the hotel next door when the Sheraton Bar told us there was a 45 min wait for food. CJ \u2019s deli is another great choice esp. for take out. The nearby Safeway was a great source to load our in room mini fridge. Green options We tried to take advantage of some \u201c green measures \u201d by hanging up our towels and therefore not having them replaced but they were changed every day anyway. Also we did not indicate we wanted our sheets changed but they were every day anyway. There were signs throughout the room promoting the green options and I was disappointed they were not put into practice. Tips 1If you are a Starwod hotel member you might receive a discount on food at various participating restaurants. This may change with promotion dates but check it out in case it is available. Be aware each staff member we asked had a different answer and we left with no idea if were getting a discount or not2I always bring along a insulated thermal cup which works great for keeping my coffee hot in the morning and tropical drink cold in the evening while keeping the sand andor pool water out. I find this to be quite helpful on vacations3Consider bringing water shoes especially if you plan on exploring several beaches many that have rocks crabs etc. The shoes really do help. 4Be sure to leave your spray sun screen at home. This harms the reef and is banned from some locations. On an excursion we actually had to sign a contract that we would n\u2019t use it5Since the hotel charges extra for shaded lounge chairs or beach chairs we opted to buy our own at a nearby drugstore. There are many near by and you can save a lot of money. They are great to throw in your car and go exploring or even watching your kid take a surf lesson etc \u2026. 6Finaly since we have sensitive skin so we always travel with an anti itch creme and Benadryl. This is useful is you are snorkeling where you might get stung or \u201c bit \u201d by microscopic sea creatures. We even take Adolphs meat tenderizer with us as it helps with jelly fish stings. I strongly recommend bringing these items if you are traveling with kids.

In my opinion this is a 35 hotel. Checked in was quick from a very nice front desk staff. Hotel ground is huge with beautiful garden and well manicured green lawn.

We felt cold at night with the unit running so we had to turn it off and left the sliding door slightly open to let in some fresh air into our room. We tried the open air restaurant bar near the beach the food is fine. Dinner in the more expensive Black Rock restaurant of the hotel was delightful. We got good service and the food was better than average. Although prices are quite expensive but good value for money. Breakfast buffet is pricy as well variety is good but average food taste at best. The service we received was quite good though. There was a major storm that passed by the island of Maui and neighboring islands during our second night of our 8night stay in October 2017. There was an island wide power blackout in Maui I was told. The hotel had emergency power in the main building where the hotel lobby is located. I was able to re charge my phone there in the main building. Thankfully power came back on in the Kanapali Beach hotel area by around 8 am This hotel is about a 10 15 minute walk to the popular Whaler \u2019s Village where there are good restaurants and a small open air shopping mall. We enjoyed the beachside walkway to and from the Whaler \u2019s Village. However keep this in mind for persons with disabilities. Kanapali Beach in October 2017 was not crowded compared to always busy Waikiki Beach therefore Kanapali Beach has a little feeling of exclusivity. The hotel charges 50 for a day use of a beach cabana. They also charge you for daily resort fees that add up to a pretty substantial sum at check out. We know beforehand about these expenses so no major complaint regarding these matters. I think you will have an enjoyable and relaxing vacation in this hotel as we did.

I was so excited to stay at the Sheraton Maui for my Honeymoon. I picked it so that we could enjoy the resort feel and my husband and I could just relax knowing everything was taken care of. We paid more than we would normally pay because we were interested in the amenities a resort provides. I really wanted it to be a special trip for my husband. Our first two days were relatively uneventful but not without hiccups. When we arrived the staff was pleasant but there was no lei or little special treat to make you get into the resort mood that I have experienced at less expensive Hawaiian resorts in the past. I let them know it was our honeymoon and we were n\u2019t even congratulated. We found our room and it was fine except that the AC is either on full blast or not at all. We went down to the pool and enjoyed one of the pool bar restaurants where the waitress was very nice and gave us some great recommendations for places to visit. We did notice as everyone else has mentioned that there were not enough pool chairs at the pool. The next day we noticed a steep decline in service at the restaurants. Our waiter in the morning seemed distracted and missed my husbands order. Finally we would n\u2019t care but we were in a hurry to get to the ferry and could n\u2019t wait for them to cook it for him. The waiter was very nice and offered for him to get whatever he wanted from the buffet but my husband was feeling grumpy and we had to go. The next day we tried to eat at the buffet again and my husband enjoyed his food but they ran out of a lot and had long wait times to replenish it 10 minutes for more oatmeal and no one came to refill our coffee or water which was frustrating because again we were in a relative hurry and the buffet was rather expensive. The next day we skipped breakfast at the hotel and ate off property but we came back to the bar restaurant we had previously enjoyed. This time the staff seemed again distracted no one came to greet us once we did flag someone down and ordered it took a while to get our food and no one came to refill our water or our drinks. The man who was working was covering too many tables which I think was the same issue at the buffet. The entire experience up to this point was not living up to what we expected service was lacking it did n\u2019t feel special and every little thing was an upcharge or a hassle. But we were still ignoring the bad and just enjoying the vacation and Maui in general. The next morning things got much worse. We were up early to take a day tour and noticed a paper posted in the elevator that said there was a work stoppage and that housekeeping service would be effected as well as the restaurants. It was worded in a way that made it seem like services would be slightly impacted and did n\u2019t spell out what was actually about to happen. When we got back from our trip there no more information slipped under our door or left in a message. There was trash left down our hallway and a pile of towels and toiletries on a table near the elevator. What the strike actually meant is that there is no housekeeping service to the rooms you can pick up your own towels though. All the bars and restaurants are closed. They do have a bunch of what appear to be teenagers serving a limited menu of maybe 7 items in one of the buildings and running the buffet. No one from the hotel thought that maybe they should consider people with dietary restrictions when making up their menu. The kids working the room seem nice but burgers in take out containers being served with plastic cutlery is n\u2019t what I signed up for when I paid more to stay at a nice resort. When you come back from a tour you do n\u2019t want to arrange for transportation to other hotels so you can eat somewhere else. The closing of the pool bar saddens us the most because we came here for the pool and planned to spend the last few days of our honeymoon out there enjoying the amenities and relaxing before heading back to work. Tonight they left trash bags by our door without any explanation. Judging from the debris in the hallway I think we are supposed to bundle up dirty towels or maybe the trash and throw it out there. It would be nice if they told us or updated us at all. I went to the desk last night to ask what they were going to do to make this better for the guests and all they offered was to waive the 26 daily resort fee. I feel like this is a good beginning but they act like not having these amenities is n\u2019t really a big deal and that they \u2019re doing us a favor by offering anything. I think that \u2019s BS. People paid more to stay here precisely for the things that are no longer available and the price difference when I was booking between hotels with fewer amenities and this resort was much more than 26 a day. I plan to approach the front desk again tomorrow and will amend this review if they do anything to rectify the situation. I bear no ill will to those on the picket lines.

My wife and I stayed at the Sheraton for our honeymoon last week 1030 12. We were shocked when we arrived at the resort only to find the entrance blocked by a loud picket line of striking workers. Upon checking in we were notified that all hotel staff housekeeping restaurant workers pool attendants etc went on strike several weeks ago. Regular housekeeping was not offered and the restaurants were open for extremely limited hours. We can not believe we were n\u2019t notified of the strike in advance \u2013 it put such a damper on our honeymoon experience. Here \u2019s what you can expect if you stay here while the strike is ongoing 1 minimal to no on site dining options 2. Housekeeping service only upon request 3. No bar service anywhere after 630 pm 4. No polside food beverage service. With the restaurants closed the resort has no atmosphere and feels like a dead zone. We stayed several nights at a resort in Wailea and enjoyed having a cocktail in the lounge while taking in live music and the atmosphere. In contrast at the Sheraton upon arriving back to the resort from dinner because you have to go off site you \u2019l find yourself returning to what feels like an empty resort and have no options other than to retreat to your dark \u201c unhousekept \u201d room. I will give credit to the workers who were somehow managing to even keep the resort open evidently they were all managers \u2013 they were working hard but appeared to be overworked and tired out. Upon commenting about our experience and disappointment about not being notified of the strike we were given a slight discount on our room and they waived parking and the resort fee. The discount nowhere near made up for how our experience was altered. In hindsight had we known this was occurring we absolutely would have stayed at a different resort. Beyond the strike our room was dated. The bathroom appeared to have some more recent cosmetic upgrades but the bed living room areas were outdated and the carpet was worn. We paid a premium for a \u201c deluxe ocean view \u201d room and while the view of Black Rock was good there seemed to be many other better parts of the resort much closer to the pool area than we were. On a positive note the best thing about the resort is undoubtedly the beach and location to Black Rock. The grounds and pool area were well maintained and nice to enjoy.

I travel all of the time and I never complain this may literally be my first review. But the experience at this hotel was so poor that I could not let it go by without comment even after months of sleeping on it. I do not know where to start. First the gym is not available when it rains because there are regular leaks through the ceiling. My issue is not that the gym is unavailable but that rather than fix the leak the hotel has decided just to permanently remove tiles and set up drip buckets whenever it rains. Second the hotel is severely understaffed and everything takes forever. It was not usual to wait 15 minutes for a valet when I was the only guest waiting the valet worker was not allowed to leave his post because he was the only worker available. Check in was a nightmare. Third the hotel can not even get little things right. The lounge was closed without notice even though the lounge is listed as a benefit when you pay the daily resort fee. Also good luck getting one of the 25ish seats by the pool we went down the road to the Westin to hang out at their pool instead. Finally the hotel does not even keep umbrellas stocked for guests when it rains. At 9AM the hotel was out of umbrellas but they had thousands on plastic ponchos. Again down the street at the Westin we saw hundreds of extra umbrellas being handed out like it was no big deal all through the afternoon. Sorry to sound like I am complaining but I reached out to Mariot Bonvoy multiple times and never received a reply. Its obvious they do not care. This hotel looks like it may have been cool in the 1960s and has not received an upgrade since. Look at all the other recent reviews and see how everyone is disappointed.", "offset": [296, 393], "date": "2019-06-17", "cpt": "1", "category": "facility"}, {"id": 16, "uid": "90877941-a973-471c-8287-5e173b5b9124", "sentence": "Would not recommend or ever return. Where to begin. The service here is severely lacking. With the exception of a few friendly people like Chelsea at vacation services and the pool hale people when we are purchasing Maui Jims from them. the staff here is indifferent. We make a habit of meeting everyone with a smile and giving the benefit of the doubt but after an 8 days of disappointment I see that it is an overall company culture issue. On Friday I called to book a massage for Saturday. On Saturday morning I called to confirm my appointment. I arrive 15 minutes before my 11 am appointment like I was asked. 20 minutes later I still have not been called back. Finally the woman at the reception desk tells me that she does not see me on the schedule and has me follow her down the hall to the back. We see a therapist the woman apologizes to her profusely. I assume her shift was over but now she has to stay to accommodate me. I walk into the room that looks like a gym locker room. Tile on the walls and floors and a shower in the corner. She asks if I have any requests and I ask her to concentrate on my neck shoulders and back. She leaves the room and I undressed and laid down. When she walked in she pulled the blankets down and exposes my back then leaves the room for a moment then comes back and gathers her supplies meanwhile I am lying there exposed and cold. I booked a sun healing massage that included marble stones and a special aloe gel. I looked back at the brochure afterward when I realized I only felt lotion and not a gel or stones during the massage. About halfway through I am so cold I have goose bumps so I ask if there is a fan on and if so could she please lower it. She did not seem to feel comfortable communicating in English. She said something then left the room and came back a minute later and continued working on me without saying anything. I am still cold so I asked so there is not a fan on. She said sorry and continued working. This is when music kicked on. I was happy that at least that happened. I was still cold though so I asked if there was a heater option on the bed. She again said she had go check. She left the room and came back and said sorry. Two songs later the music turned off again. When my massage was over I dressed and noticed that it was 158 am Keep in mind my conversation with reception about them not having me on their schedule began at 105. I walked into the room at 110. So I did not get my full 50 minutes either. A disappointing 130 massage. We reserved two large cabanas and three small casabelas for Sunday. The rental is from 8 5. It includes towel service and water. At 815 no one from the pool hale has come to survive the cabanas. Finally we undo the shades to block the sun. We were waiting because we did not want to damage anything. Finally after 9 we were brought our towels and water. There was no need to give us a demo on the shades. My family of 15 were all here to celebrate my mothers birthday. We tried to call the concierge to see if there was any type of celebration package we could purchase. Balloons cake etc. but no answer. So we went to the grocery store and bought a cake ourselves. There are signs that say no outside food or beverages in the pool beach resort areas. Not a single staff member stopped by during our 9 hour rental to see that we were having outside food. Clearly they did not care. Last night I wanted to enjoy the whirlpool after a day exploring Hana. The sign next to it says the whirlpool is open from 8 am 10 pm At 8 I got there to see a chain blocking the entrance with an additional sign that said pool closed. As a part of the 26 daily resort fee there are supposedly free activities offered. Today there is a 10 am lei making class by the pool. At 945 I call the concierge twice to make sure I am at the right place. Straight to voicemail both times. So I walk up to the third floor lobby and there is no wait to see the concierge. He confirms the location and time. I walk back down to the pool at 95. At 1015 still no sign of a lei making class happening so I call the concierge again. No answer. I call 8 more times over the course of 10 minutes. No answers for the first half. Straight to voicemail for the rest. Mind you we are a family of 15 paying for 7 rooms for 8 nights. We paid about 500 for cabanas. 2 out of 5 of us who paid for 130 massages had unsatisfactory experiences. My husband and I stayed at the Hyat down the beach a few years ago and tried the Sheraton this time but I am so sad that we did not pay the difference to stay there and make this special 60th birthday and family reunion for my mom the experience she deserves. I am not a confrontational person but it took until today our second to last day to finally write this out. I have had enough.", "offset": [2248, 2414], "date": "2019-06-18", "cpt": "1", "category": "facility"}, {"id": 17, "uid": "dba00444-8938-4dff-9399-100fbee4474f", "sentence": "Amazing View at the Deluxe Ocean View but. Let me start with the GREAT part we were there for our honeymoon and the View location on Lahaina Maui is outstanding. We got the sunset room upgraded more on this later and the view was absolutely one of a kind. We see the Lanai and Molokai Island directly from the balcony. During sunset it literally is one of a kind and has to be one of the best in the world. PERIODLocation of the hotel is great as well it is situated right on top of Black Rock Reef and near Airport Reef so you can walk out to the beach and start snorkeling immediately and that is nearly priceless. During check in there was heavy construction going on in the lobby and there was a makeshift check in counter more like a bellmen desk re purposed. The noise was crazy and they were going to give us a room near the lobby since it was our honeymoon we requested to move far away from the noise. They were able to move us to the deluxe oceanview sunset room. The room itself was very good but the view is breathtaking. So if it was not for the world class view i would have graded this much lower. There was construction going on in the lobby i know it is temporary but it still ruins our time at the beach as the jackhammers were going on non stop during the 5 days we were there except Sunday. The front desk did try to waive some fees here and there which added up to quite a bit. so we were grateful for that but it still ruined our honeymoon a tad as we were not able to really relax at the pool area it sounded like home NYCThe Pool is ran like a public pool too where random people were jumping in and out of the pools that were not staying there. There were hotel towels all over the beach and pool area left unattended and not cleaned up. The pool chairs were all hogged up early and left empty for the majority of the time we were there. Towels were given to guest and non guest. so technically you could just stay at a cheaper hotel and just use the Sheratons pool facilities towels with zero checks. Now heres the worse and best part. on our last day we rushed back to hotel to catch the sunset. Decided to go to beach real quick then the sunset in the room we get to the pool and there were no towels. period. The pool desk said sorry no more towels nothing they can do told us to go to my room to get my room towels or go to front desk. My room is about a 10 min walk and I asked if they can get towels delivered to us and they told us we have to go to front desk to ask for it. This is the Sheraton on Maui. i never in a million years expected this. Now for the first time EVER i complained at the front desk. the Kind front desk lady Salia was extremely kind and helpful. She called to get towels for us immediately but guess what no towels for her either. she made 3 different phone calls and still nothing. So what does she do she walks me over to the hotels store and buys us 2 towels and a flower for my bride. I objected but she insisted as she will get reimbursed. So now i feel like a real jackass for complaining and making the poor girl buy it out of her own pocket. I hope she did get reimbursed for the funds as her kind gesture was appreciated but also made us feel bad. I honestly would not expect any of this from a Sheraton and nonetheless in Mauii would possibly stay here again in the future for the insane view but i hope they are finished with construction soon and tidy up the pool area improve the pool security.", "offset": [1905, 2026], "date": "2019-09-03", "cpt": "1", "category": "facility"}, {"id": 18, "uid": "7653c0b7-f5cf-4ff5-9b7e-86dd674037da", "sentence": "Snorkeling at the resor.
