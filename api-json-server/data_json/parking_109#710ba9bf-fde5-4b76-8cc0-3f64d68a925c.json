Hottest weekend in a long long long long time. Make sure you book a room close the central hub we did not think of it at the time of booking. This resort has a salt water lagoon that is the central hub for things to do. Accommodation 35 stars out of 5 Pros Room was nice clean and reasonably modern and most importantly the air conditioning worked. We went for the King Bed and foldout sofa for the kids I actually slept on the sofa bed one night and it did not break my back. Cons As hot as it was even on 18 degrees the air con was averageyeh yeh better than none. Bedroom air con was garbage as the vent is up high and it shoots onto a overhead door trim. This keeps the coolness at the top of the bedroom not down where you want it. Fridge on lowest setting takes forever to chill a bottle of water and the freezer is laughable. THINGS TO DO 45 stars out of 5 Free Kyaking sailing lagoon blow up trampoline swimming in the resort pool. Paid Aqua fun park 20 for 50 mins or 15 for 30 mins must book Blow up playground on water. Paddle boards Do nt know cost Archery 15 Was hot but fun. Bike hire 20 an hour yes an hour. Pros Did everything on that list except bike hire and paddle boards. Aqua playground was fun for the whole family. Cons More a suggestion that the Aqua playground should have discount for the more people that go on it. Food 4 out of 5 stars Breakfast and other dinner nights 4 out of 5. Seafood Night 5 out of 5. Pros Bar and takeaway section were very reasonably priced. Cons Seafood night is 75 an adult and if your family does not eat seafood and only eat the roasts they still have to pay the same price. Service 4 out of 5 Check in was not fast and the foyer etc was not air conditioned so sweating even at checkout. Restaurant Staff seemed friendly and inviting but service times were inconsistant. Overall I was reasonable satisfied with the venue v price. Kids loved it and was overall a positive family event. Would normally go Goldcoast but on this occasion we were going to Australia Zoo on the Monday which is not too far away.", "offset": [1051, 1141], "date": "2015-01-23 00:00:00", "cpt": "0", "category": "parking"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "e4454d84-d960-4413-aa35-eafd5ae13599", "sentence": "Great spot for families and kids. We booked in over the Christmas New Year period and spent 4 days at Twin Waters. The resort is very well set up for families with pre and primary school aged kids there is a games room pool water recreation and other activities and is an extremely close walk to the beach. As it was peak season the check in process was probably a little rushed and not as friendly as I would have expected. We were given a top level room right near reception that had a great position. Unfortunately our daughter was quite ill and had vomited over a large part of the room on the first night. This was no problem for the staff on what was an exceptionally busy night. we were moved to another room further away from reception in a room that had tiles. This was a relief as I did not relish staying in a room that smelt of sick on a hot humid night after driving 17 hours. The benefits of this resort is that there are lots of activities to keep the children amused. We dined at the casual cafe for breakfast a few times as we did not feel like having a huge breakfast every morning. The options are limited however sufficient for our family. The free activities were good games room although some other children hogged the playstation for an hour one day table tennis putt putt kayaks free movies pool etc and it is well worth spending the 25 for an hour session on the water activity area. We did not go in the paid games arcade could not justify the money for exclusive use and our kids were not that interested. You get a token to wear around your wrist whilst in the pool area tip place it on kids ankles so you do not lose them and you also get to swap your towels over as many times as you like during your stay. As Twin Waters opens the water rec area to the public for a daily price if you are arriving during the day parking could be tricky. We found the signage to the car park not terribly great at the start as it when first arriving trying to find the best park for your room is not easy. Tip if you have a room with tiles ask for an extra 2 bathmats to place at the front door and screen door as otherwise your floor is covered in sand and they did not wash the floors every day. The rooms are quite dated so if you are someone who prefers an immaculate room you may be disappointed. We were in a garden room and there was some evidence of rust on the lamp shades and there was definite signs of wear and tear inside the wardrobes. The air conditioning is either on or off and hot or cold with no ability to alter the temperature so depending on your preference this could be an issue or not. The mini bar size fridges are perfect for storing basic essentials however just check yours is working ok. We had a room with a double bed and pull out sofa bed for the girls which was fine for us and the length of stay. It would have been good to have been supplied 4 normal glasses and tea coffee cups as we were only provided with 2. The washing machines and dryers in the laundry were excellent they all worked really well and were coin operated. It is a bit tricky finding the laundry at first as the resort is a bit of a rabbit warren and some of the signs were damaged. There does need to be some improvement to communication between some staff. At one point in trying to book the water activities I was sent to a VIP desk then reception then back to the hut near the water. Not sure what happened however we got there in the end. Also if you have mobility issues request a lower floor as there are no lifts in the complex. The resort is gorgeous to walk around at night and first thing in the morning. If you are into exercise there is a good running track and as the location is so close to the beach it is really well located. I would recommend this for young families on a medium budget who do not mind if the rooms are not 5 star new and are just wanting a family holiday where they can access a number of activities in close vicinity.", "offset": [1869, 2019], "date": "2015-01-27 00:00:00", "cpt": "0", "category": "parking"}, {"id": 2, "uid": "9535c8e9-b7c2-4680-8769-77044621320b", "sentence": "Bar food for lunch very expensive and very average but other options available.

I felt sorry for the small wedding on the beach outside our room however as a large function further down the resort had a beach party with live band which destroyed the quiet ambiance they had tried to create for the wedding.
