Did n\u2019t know hotel was under renovations. Noisy so could nt take afternoon nap. Pool and hot tub closed. Room was spacious and clean but extremely small bathroom. Housekeeper knocking on door at 9AM ready to open door. Breakfast was wonderful. Pictures on website did n\u2019t match room or bathroom in any way. Overall disappointing. Looking for couple weekend instead it was intrusive. Only one elevator for awhile and stair door was LOCKED that really concerns me in event of fire. Free shuttle to nowhere. Did have pretty water feature in lobby though. Overall not what we expected. Hotelscom should be up to date on hotel renovations. Would have stayed elsewhere if I had time to change hotel.

The only issue we noticed was how warm the interior of the hotel was and the pool room was so stiflingly hot it might as well have been a large steam room. It will knock you down.
