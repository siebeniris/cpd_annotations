Got a great deal on Hotwire while taking a roadtrip over Christmas vacation and what a beautiful hotel this is. Not only was the room fabulous but the staff was genuine and super friendly as well as helpful.

I am not a coffee drinkerand not being able to get hot water for a cup of tea was ofputing. for what is suppose to be a 4 star. I know it was too cold to walk around To see the access to other sights so can not comment on location. When we return to the city we will most likely not stay again. It was an okay hotel.

This Is Not A Four Diamond Property. I would have rated this experience between poor and average. The property is pleasing enough nice lobby with the warmest fireplace I have ever felt. Nice on the cold nigts we were there. Check in process could have been better if they had had more than one person at the check in desk. The young man was helping the people before us and it took a long time. Not only was he checking them in to the hotel he was also selling aquarium tickets and explaining transportation and directions. They need more than one person or possibly a concierge to do this so other who are merely checking in do not have such a long wait. When he got to us he failed to key our keys to both doors of the suite we had and he never offered us any aquarium tickets. Our suite was nice. Very large with 2 big rooms and a bath and 12. The water pressure in the shower was poor. The security locks on both doors are a latch that slides into another piece. The one on the door that he did not key was broken. I feel this should be something that is checked and repaired before they rent the room. It is truly needed for extra security and peace of mind. Also one of the TVs did not turn on at all. We called for this and they replaced the dead batteries. again something that should be checked before they put a guest in the room. We requested turndown but never received it. i mentioned it to another front desk person and she said she would make sure we got in that evening. Never happened. Two different people said it would be done but was not. They provide coffee in the lobby in the morning but it was so bitter we could not drink it. It was the same in the restaurant Broad Street Grill which i will review seperately. They offer valet or garage parking. The garage is quite a hike from the lobby. When the bill arrived under our door the rate for both nights was incorrect. I had double checked this prior to arrival and had a confirmation with the correct rates. They adjusted it. it was almost a 100 error in their favor. I am glad I checked it sometimes we are in a rush and just pay. So all in all we were not that happy with this hotel. AAA should not rate it above 3 stars.", "offset": [410, 538], "date": "2015-03-10", "cpt": "0", "category": "transport"}, {"id": 4, "uid": "106210de-189a-45b5-bf06-06cef63448e1", "sentence": "First off Josh. The guy who greeted us at the front desk around 11 pm on 32915. He saw us coming across the lobby and greeted us warmly then proceeded to check us in with a smile. He was pleasant friendly informative and professional. My boyfriend and I travel for a living and interact with many late night front desk attendants and we both agreed that Josh has given us the best customer service we have encountered in a long time. People like Josh MAKE 4star hotels. The Chatanogan is lucky to have him. About the hotel itself the room was clean and comfortable the internet was fast tv was great. A word on parking it does cost 8 per day so come prepared for that charge and do not give Josh any guff ok. We ate breakfast in the hotel. NOTE. the guide in our room said breakfast was at 11 am but it is actually at 1030am. We barely made it in time but the dining room staff were not put out and allowed us to partake even as they were preparing for lunch. They even offered to grab items from the buffet for us so we would not have to rush an unexpected kindness. The buffet was aprox. 13 and was quite good. Lastly for those who complain that this hotel is too far from local attractions A There is a FREE trolley that stops on the street IN FRONT OF THE HOTEL. It makes stops at most of the major downtown attractions. B. The Chatanogan is 1 mile from the Aquarium 25 from the Zoo 2 from the National Cemetery and only a 15 minute drive from Ruby Falls. This is 2015. Google Map your trip and be prepared to travel accordingly. it is not the hotels fault if you did not do your research. Overall a great hotel that I had recommend to visitors.

The main reason I would not stay here again is the location. I walked outside to wander around and within 30 seconds was approached by a man asking for money.

Next time I will stay closer to the food entertainment district. The bar and food was okay although the kitchen messed up our order and only partially corrected their mistake and the entertainment cancelled last minute the night we chose to visit on our way in from our long day.

Highly recommend. Very nice hotel in pretty much every way. Valet us are super friendly front desk staff are quick friendly. Rooms are nice comfy clean. Water pressure is serious in the shower haha. The spa is on the 2nd floor they offer massages such this is also where the pool is located. It is indoor really just a splash pool it is only 312 feet deep. There is a hot tub too. The pool chemicals are very strong which is good for germs but be aware. We read in one review not to stay on the 2nd floor because of the spa it would be noisy we were on the 2nd floor had no problems. Guess it just depends on who is at the hotel. The restaurants in the hotel are nice. Breakfast is a big buffet it is not included but that is to be expected this is not a holiday inn express it is a nicer upscale hotel with lots of banquet rooms even a small amphitheater. The chef waiters at breakfast carry on chit chat they were very funny. The towns free shuttle that runs every few minutes has a stop about a 3 minute walk from the hotel. We used that but we also just walked to the aquarium area which was about a 2025 minute walk through town.
