We have been to Dubai a few times but wanted to try a new location. We had a beautiful room a moderate suite with separate living and bedroom areas and two baths with two large balconies overlooking the pool and beach area. The lobby area the spa the hotel property overall is gorgeous. Great attention was paid to architecture and decor. If design is important to you this hotel will not disappoint. Our room was generous in size with walk in closets and perfectly appointed bathrooms. Because the property is new you will enjoy not only the stunning decor but small touches like in wall plug adapters for various countries the latest electronics contemporary lighting and other convenience features such as electronic drapes etc. The staff was for the most part very professional friendly and accommodating and in time I think this will be one of the best choices in Dubai. We experienced a few glitches mostly due to the lack of training for staff or just the newness of the property surely these things will get addressed in the coming months. Things to consider. The two pools one quiet and one for kids or louder activities are wonderful. Really beautiful surroundings for a Dubai location. We loved hanging out at the pools with the palms and flowers cascading all around. Great chairs wonderful set ups and good service at the pools. However if you are looking for the best beach location this Four Seasons may not be the place for you. The actual beach area at the hotel is very nice but small. The views presently to the left and right include construction walls or other construction obstructions that detract from the overall feel of the beach. Also if you are looking for great food options this hotel will be limiting for you. The food quality was fine there just are not really any exciting options for dining. If we saw a big gap in service this is where we noticed it the most in the dining areas. The hostesses were often uninviting upon arrival and then several of the servers in the restaurants were not up to par for a five star resort. We waited for long periods with no service were served the wrong food we were given checks before we finished eating then alternately could not find anyone for service. servers gave us incorrect information about options served our food to others and then attempted to put the same dish on our table after it sat on the wrong table etc. Just lack of training and supervision I believe but worth noting. Especially as food service often involves food safety and also because Dubai has some of the BEST food in the world. so I have to trust that the Four Seasons will bring this up to par for this property quite soon. I think the breakfast buffet was nice enough in the main hotel restaurant and we looked forward to seating on the patio each morning. It was very much a buffet experience however and so anything beyond lunch there seemed less desirable. Pool side lunches proved to be a good alternative for us. Fortunately it is easy to go out and enjoy the many fantastic restaurant alternatives in Dubai. For all the foodies out there just noting that we did not find the Four Seasons to be outstanding in this department during its initial opening period. If activities or outside excursions are important for you be sure to do your homework before you leave for Dubai and make arrangements early to avoid missing out. Things are often filled up even before you arrive. While we found the concierge desk to be very professional and helpful a few of the junior staff members were not as knowledgeable as the others that were truly exceptional and you would not want to leave your details to chance. Things we recommend 1. See the Desert Desert Jeep 4x4 Tours with Dinner super exciting if you opt for the more aggressive dune driving tours or nice if you just go for the more leisurely tour and have dinner at the desert camp with belly dancing and short camel rides under the stars included. Not so impressed with the falcon option so do not worry about skipping that part. Absolutely take the more extreme driving tours if your group would enjoy that type of activity. We have done both and enjoyed each for different reasons. Just note here is a BIG difference in the company you take and the option you chose so clarify and ask for the one the suits you best. If I went again I would try to take the least full or smaller company I would take the more thrilling extreme driving option neither is truly extreme and I would try to be the first or last vehicle in line. I would spend a few dollars more and also opt for a private car for sure otherwise you could be assigned a 4x4 with others if you are only two or three for your group. Good excursion for adults or kids. The photos on the dunes are great be sure to take your camera. If you do not take a 4x4 tour then maybe check out the sand surfing wildlife tours camel rides etc. BUT be sure to head out to the dunes. 2. Ski Dubai and Penguin Encounter. I thought this would be horrible or so touristic that I would not enjoy it but we all loved the experience of skiing within a mall and hanging out with the penguins. Mainly for kids I suppose but our adults applauded by surprise. The snow is better than you would expect the run is longer than we thought it could be and we all said it was a totally fun short adventure3. Atlantis Day Pass with Dolphin Adventure. I would never opt to stay at Atlantis Dubai after experiencing that property in the Bahamas for the sake of my kids one too many times. but we all did enjoy going over to the Atlantis Dubai for an afternoon with the Dolphin programs. Excellent marine staff there and a different dolphin encounter than we did in the Bahamas. Great adventure for families with kids. 4. Helicopter Over Dubai5. Burj Kahlifa Dubai Mall Fountain Show People watching shopping coffee etc6. Restaurants Burj Kahlifa and Armani Hotel. All have great atmosphere wonderful food and views7. Shows and touring artists Check out the schedule as Dubai has many exciting performers and shows booked at various times.", "offset": [991, 1162], "date": "2015-01-05", "cpt": "0", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "4c0829d5-44da-47e5-a4c1-1de765272192", "sentence": "Valentine weekend stay. My husband and I stayed the Thursday and Friday of the Valentines weekend. Firstly I can not empathise enough how much we both enjoyed our break. Staff on the whole were well trained and very knowledgable. I checked in independently was given a tour of facilities and recommendations and escorted to child free pool area to relax until our beach front suit was available I was early. This I could not fault the hotel is beautiful with a nice modern minimalist Arabic feel. I initially however was dropped by taxi at the left side entrance I had never visited before and the bellman asked why I would come to this door. I explained I had never been before and he was promptly shooed away by another door man and escorted to the front desk. I was a slightly rude welcome from a Four Season staff member but this was quickly forgotten. The pool area was quiet and had the level of luxury you had expect from this new Four Seasons fresh chilled towel facial mist samples of gazpacho sunglass cleaning and a buzzer system by your lounger that vibrates on the waiters wrist this insures that you do not have to look around when ordering food and beverages. The cocktails at pool side are fabulous and there is cocktail of the day tweaked to your specific tastes. The polside staff were exceptionally well trained and had a fantastic attitude. When my room was ready a member of staff from the front desk came to my lounger to notify me rather than just ring my cell phone another nice touch. The polside loungers in front of the infinity pool are resting in the water its a beautiful touch to sit with your feet in the water. Our room was beautiful soft fresh colours throughout great size beautiful bathroom tub lovely sized balcony. Nice little features such as push button drapes TV integrated in to bathroom mirror not to mention wonderfully comfortable bed. Our one negative experience would come from dining at Sea Fu not the staff who were knowledgeable and well trained but the food it was not exceptional over priced and wine list was the same. I had the Foie gras with abalone it was underseasoned and really not amazing at all. I was also 120AED. I followed this with the Sea Bass it was good but still not exceptional and portions were so small they left you hungry dessert was good but not amazing I had the Baby Pineapple and my husband chose the Chocolate Cigars his was exceptionally good. Service was slightly rushed too leaving you feeling you were on a customer conveyor belt. Expensive and disappointing. The Hendricks Bar was a delight Michael from Portugal was a fantastic very informative and helped us select from a great range of cocktails and cigars. A fabulous staff member. The Mercury Lounge is also a must do. Service atmosphere view over the whole of the Dubai DownTown Dubai and Burj Khalifa not to mention the cocktail range that make for a lovely evening. I tried the Prezioso Cocktail with Nutela Kina Martini Bianco and Gold Dust a sweet delight. I could of sat there all evening. Once again I want to congratulate the Four Seasons team this is an exceptional hotel that feels exclusive I would not hesitate to return.", "offset": [643, 762], "date": "2015-02-15", "cpt": "0", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 2, "uid": "201b3b01-1a81-4e33-bc89-be7d37b4c4e8", "sentence": "construction bad service I always try to book Four Seasons when I travel but never again in Dubai. Washington DC Houston Doha Riyadh Toronto Cairo etc. etc. have all been wonderful experiences but the problem with Dubai is the level of service is that of a four star. If it was cheaper then maybe but the construction really bothered me so be careful. Let me share with you my bad experience I started by reading online that there is construction and read many bad reviews about that. I thought all of Dubai used to be construction so how bad could it be. I called the hotel before I book and asked about 1. How bad and loud2. What time. At night. On wekendsThe hotel said not that bad and not very close and not at night and did not comment on weekends. They were lying all weekend and all night is loud noisy shovels. They told me it is far away but actually there are two locations and one of them was right from my suit \u2019s balcony. For a sweet of 150 let me recommend my wonderful experiences in Dubai at Armani Shangri La and Fairmont some even cheaper and by far much better service. I checked in to the room and a guy escorts you to the room which I really did n\u2019t need but once he did and wanted to leave I called him to hand him the cleaning products that were left behind to clean the windows and tables. That was just the beginning. The Spa was bad and we used it every day for 4 days hoping it was just that treatment but the reflexology manicure pedicure facial all bad. The massage was fine but nothing wow. We ordered 5 steaks to room service and it happens all around the world is that sometimes its not the way I want but for a medium to be well done is not right. On the first day I got turndown service on the second day I asked for it complaining as to when will they come so they apologized for not coming. On the third day I went back to my room at midnight and I had no energy to complain and wit for someone to remove the decorative pillows and put water next to the bed and and so I just went to sleep. The room service menu is on the TV screen which is annoying but they do odder a paper version. but it \u2019s wrong. The Crab egg skillet is marked vegetarian fine i m making a big deal. One mistake is fine but many a day gets annoying. The least room service could have done when they mess up an order is cancel it. Instead I get a call half an hour after we finish eating offering me a desert. I was leaving my room then so I passed. A manager talked to me on the way out after a wonderful waiter talked to me after I checked out and took my business card. She said she would call me the next day but did n\u2019t. why promise if you do n\u2019t deliver.

As I mentioned It was my first time in dubai and I stayed for just a week so getting out to see the city was tempting on a side and the confort and spirit of the hotel kept dragging me to stay and enjoy every moment of my vacation inside which I did not do of courseBut from the moment I stept into the main gate I was surrounded by these genuine smiles and helpful initiates from every single person from the staff according to my area of expertise I can spot fake smiles easily but just like the rest of the chain I can tell that employees are happy to work in this place and that reflect on their behavior they just do not need to act helpful and happy because they are actually. And that mirrors the strong HR system they run in this organization. Receptionists are quite helpful and did not seem to suffer or lack experience if anything accidentally occurs. For the room it was clean and quite wifi was steady and room service is ready to comply within few minutes. Regarding the location the hotel exist in jumeira which is somehow a luxurious district that full of palaces and villas so do not expect to have this kind of night life around the hotel there are near places to go like mercato mall in which u may find good stores and brands but anyway getting to someplace more popular like dubai mall only takes about 20 minutes average by a taxi from the hotel pointing that the hotel is located in a strategic place in the middle of dubai. The only downside I saw was that the hotel was a little bit empty the time I was there maybe because summer in dubai is quite harsh especially in August when I was there maybe it is an advantage for someone else but for me I like it to be a little crowded not too much but at least to feel like their is life exist around me.

It is my first time travelling Dubai and staying in this resort the warm welcome from the guest service enhanced the first impression well. The check in process is smooth and advise from the concierge team is really helpful and informative. Special thanks to Cashmere for not only a personalised introduction and recommendation for my trip but also an attentive way to assist with my lost bag at the airport. She helped to check the airport and different alternatives immediately. After not more than an hour a courtesy call is made by her and the bag is found finally. I do appreciate the her positive and can do attitude on guests. The facilities in the resort are comprehensive. Although bundles of attractions are in my itinerary we spent most of the time in the resort to just relax and enjoy. The private beach and both indoor and outdoor pool are fantastic with excellent service by the staff. For the breakfast in the resort they have a choice of buffet breakfast in the Suq which contains fancy and delicious cuisine by the chefs. They do care about your dining experience as they will try their best to satisfy your request even some order is not on the menu. In room dining is another good choice as well. The resort has a user friendly iPad for ordering room service with detailed instruction with a special preference column. The food and the service from the runner are brilliant and customised too. Another impressive thing I feel in this resort is the recognition from the staff. Every time you stepped out from the room or entered the resort there is always a smily face greeting you. Ramil from the resort do a little more to enhance the experience. He remember what your itinerary is and provide some local tips to travel around. This makes my family feeling warm everyday. Last but not least the housekeeping teams observation and detailed mind is remarkable. They do think as a guest and provide what we really need in our room to comfort the stay. The luxury branded amenities do enhance the experience every night.
