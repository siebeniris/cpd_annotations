Staff are very friendly and helpful. Location not so great a seedy liquor store is in the parking lot and the lighting is not great at night. The security guard was eating snacks and watching TV in the lobby so feeling really at ease and safe not so much. The Loby is updated but the luggage cart only one was rickety and broken at one end so our first impression were not fantastic. The room was on the very low end for a Hampton more like an older Holiday inn and the bed was really the Most uncomfortable of all the Hamptions we have stayed. It was so hard I had to lay on top of two pillows to sleep. I was up at 630 am bc my hip and side hurt after sleeping 4 hours that way. The breakfast is nice eggs and potatoes had too much seasoning but they had a fantastic selection and waffle station. The poorly furnished rooms and bed will be what keeps us from coming back.
