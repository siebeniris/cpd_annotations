I wish tripadvisor had \u00bd stars because I \u2019d really prefer to give this resort a 45. There were some things that far surpassed my expectations and just a few that disappointed. But the good far outweighed the bad and I would recommend this resort to anyone. Here \u2019s my feedback and tips broken down Customer service staff. Just as others have posted the staff at EPC are truly amazing. From the moment we stepped out of the shuttle and saw Wilquin \u2019s smiling face with champagne in hand I knew we were in good hands. The resort was beautiful. We seriously had wonderful encounters with every staff member from bartenders and waitstaf to housekeeping and groundskeepers. Our favorite two ladies by far were Luz and Biany who work so hard for the activities entertainment team. They took time to get to know us and were very attentive and entertaining. Rooms. As stated in previous reviews the resort is not brand new and does show some wear. The beds were rather hard and the ground on our patio to our swim up was pretty uneven. We were in building 2 in a swim out. Although having the pool right there was awesome I was completely frustrated each time I needed to get out of the water as there were no steps or ladder. The water is pretty dep I \u2019m 5\u20192 \u201d and it was up to my chin. I guess I have no upper body strength because my husband had to help hoist me up each time. I also thought the window from the shower bathroom was weird and I \u2019ve been married for 10 years. Our housekeeper was fabulous as was the beverage attendant. We left a note and small tip the first day asking for lots of bottle water and we were stocked the entire time. The only other issue I had was some squawking bird in the courtyard between the buildings at all hours of the night. Make sure to download a white noise ap on your phone. All in all the rooms were nice. Pools We primarily hung out by the pool bar. Rafts were definitely in demand but we always seemed to find them. The bartenders at the pool bar were fabulous and the drinks were awesome. Try the mamajuana. you wo n\u2019t be disappointed. And watch out for the mudslides. We loved playing bingo at the pool \u2019s edge and meeting new people. One afternoon a group of us decided to sit in the hot tubs and someone complained about our volume. That was a little frustrating as we were just trying to talk over the jacuzi jets but oh well. Beach. I wish I would have spent more time on the beach. I honestly thought the water temperature was warmer than the pools. The sand was so fine and beautiful. and I typically hate sand. Yes the waves are rough and you need to be careful. I knew this ahead of time. We only spent one day on the beach and my husband and I boogie boarded. It was SO much fun. You do n\u2019t have to and should n\u2019t go out too far. The waves keep coming and there \u2019s a pretty strong current but that made for awesome boogie boarding. After about 10 turns a pretty big wave took me down and I basically had a salt water nasal rinse time to be done. Still a beautiful beach with fun waves. Food. I \u2019m a huge review reader. Of course I read the mixed reviews on the restaurants at this resort but I always take reviews with a grain of salt. I went in with an open mind and am not really picky nor am I a food snob. The meals were very hit or miss. We \u2019d be talking to someone about one place and they hated it whereas we loved it. It was rare that everyone would agree on what was best or worst. My husband LOVED Barcelona as did I. I also liked the pasta options at the Toscana lunch buffet. I \u2019m not a huge seafood person so I personally did n\u2019t care for the fact that there were no options for me at the Lobster House that were without seafood but I was n\u2019t surprised either. The kitchen staff accommodated me which was awesome. We had a lot of fun at Agave and loved the guacamole. The Flavor Market was a little confusing. We had a group of 6 and the process of choosing the tapas was n\u2019t really explained to us. Some of us did n\u2019t get to try what we wanted because when we ordered it was really for the whole table. I was very impressed with a few dishes but left scratching my head with some. We had a late dinner at Oregano one night and were not impressed. Again the meals were very hit or miss. Entertainment Activities. I had a wonderful free 5 minute massage by the pool and also took the organic scrub making course by the pool where I got to make a few different scrubs and try them. We played bingo a few times by the pool and my husband dove for dominos and won a little bottle of nice rum. We went to the disco twice and loved dancing although that place could be better ventilated. We left after an hour of dancing and our clothes were dripping in sweat. The parrots were fun to look at and the gift shops had a decent selection for souvenirs for the kids. We watched all of the shows and were really impressed by some others left us ready to go to bed. LOVED the Michael Jackson and Cirque de Soleil shows. The casino is small but fun for a bit. MUST DO. My favorite drink hands down was the Espresso Martini at the Martini Bar. YUM. The breakfast buffet at Toscana had a mimosa making station with orange juice or cranberry juice. I loved trying it with cranberry. Get to know the entertainment staf they are wonderful. Get to know others at the resort to we made friends with many people and it made the stay that much more enjoyable. Go the the beach and at least get your feet wet it \u2019s a beautiful beach. We even saw a few whales jumping far off shore. Most importantly relax put your phones away enjoy the vitamin D and perfect weather.", "offset": [4999, 5037], "date": "2015-03-03", "cpt": "0", "category": "entertainment"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "2c2e70fa-6a0d-483d-9b64-f6b387176413", "sentence": "Not Super Excelent\u00e9 but Almost. My wife and I travelled to this resort with another couple for the last two weeks of March 2015. It was our second stay at an Excellence resort the first being at the Excellence Riviera Cancun in Mexico last year see my Tripadvisor post. Very Close to Perfect dated April 6 2014. The latter property in Mexico is newer and as a result in better condition than the Punta Cana resort. However both are great trip destinations for adults who want to enjoys a luxurious vacation. This review will focus on Excellence Punta Cana. As noted this resort is somewhat older and is starting to show its age but not in a way that will cause any serious problems during a vacation. For instance the leather covered furniture in the room in which we stayed was beginning to fray and under the cushions there was evidence of rusted springs likely caused by the humidity. There were some paint splatters in the suites bathtub. The room however was clean and free of bed bugs and cockroaches always a concern for travellers. In the main pool area there were some cracked tiles. The property is however properly maintained and it is evident that the rooms have been updated over the years the paint splatters and a discussion with a travel rep confirm this fact. None of these minor faults detract from the grandeur of this resort. In fact the very age of the resort means that it is well established. Being established unlike other newer resorts in the area such as Chic Excellence Punta Cana has had time to grow beautiful gardens with mature trees and ponds throughout he property. The gardens and ponds contain a wide array of wildlife mostly birds and ducks. Flamingos freely roam the grounds and two parrots make their home in the trees off of the main lobby area. The older age of the resort also means that the staff and management know what guests expect and need to enjoy their vacation the guess work has long been removed from the equation. Staff on the resort are friendly and helpful. Wiliam an activity staff member is always upbeat and eager to assist. Jamie a sever at the Mexican restaurant Agave is entertaining \u2013 ask to see his balancing fork trick if ever you dine at his restaurant. The pool concierge at the main pool I forget her name was always friendly and wanting to joke around. The maids and bartenders were consistently friendly and quick to serve. The one annoyance was with the some of the staff employed to wander the resort to sell off site excursions. Destin was very persistent in his sales pitch and became bothersome to the point that we simply did not want to run into him while relaxing on the resort. Management should promote off site excursions using another method \u2013 do not allow sales staff to hound guests. Instead have a stationary location where guests can gather the information needed to learn about and purchase excursions \u2013 use the area already employed by the regular tour companies off of the main lobby. It cheapens the experience if staff is allowed to approach guests while they are relaxing on the resort. This feeling was expressed by others at the resort as well. The restaurants were varied with anything from buffet Italian French Asian Mexican Mediterranean seafood steakhouse and tapas fare. Occasionally there were dinners beach side or in the main square which featured Dominican food or a variety of foods. Room service was also available 24 hours a day at no extra cost \u2013 it was handy for early morning excursions and for late night snacks or stay in dinners. Room service was always prompt and can be ordered in advance for the early morning when placing a wake up call for an excursion. The bars are many and always available for those who wish to drink. The drinks are premium blends and are mixed to order. Beer and shots are also available. The in suite mini bar includes wine rum vodka water and pop along with a variety of cookies crackers and nuts. It is replenished daily or on request and is handy to have in the room. Management however should arrange for the used drink glasses to be changed daily instead of simply removing them from the room. Also for variety management could consider offering chips along with the mini bar services. The room is cleaned on a daily basis although on several occasions it was cleaned late in the day \u2013 and once we had to call for clean towels as the room had not yet been cleaned before supper the maids came and cleaned it directly after we called the front desk. Turn down service is also a daily routine \u2013 but it starts too early in the evening between 6 7 pm and almost always interrupted our preparations to go out for dinner we usually refused the service as a resultThe pools are great for lounging or partaking in activities. They are long winding pools so if you choose not to be part of the party or games there are plenty of spots to relax and read in quiet areas. Getting a lounger was normally not a problem pool staff does not permit \u201c saving \u201d chairs in the morning hours and will remove the items left on chairs to the lost and found if they determine the owners are not around. Beach chairs are numerous as well and finding a shady or sunny spot is not usually a problem. The beach is magnificent \u2013 you can literally walk for hours in clean soft sand. We found that walking to the right of the resort while facing the ocean was better than walking to the left. After about a 35 km walk you have passed the second of three resorts in that direction we never made it to the third resort Chic. The walk in that direction on all days but Sunday was quiet and somewhat solitary. On Sunday local families tend to come to the beach and it is more but not overly so populated with bathers. Walking to the left of the property is alright but there are fewer resorts in that direction \u2013 and there is the problem of the horse riding excursions which tend to start in that area and ride along a portion of the beach. The horses themselves are not the problem \u2013 it is their deposits which fall onto the beach and are washed into the ocean by the wave action. It is unpleasant walking around droppings. It was always windy at the resort during our 14 day stay with red flags flying for surf conditions. Regardless many guests ventured into the ocean to enjoy the waves sandy bottom and warm water. The water sports centre has boards to borrow for fun in the waves. Walking to the right of the resort guests can find calmer waters at the point beyond the resort boundaries. The gym at this resort is large with a variety of equipment. Management might want to consider placing rubber mats at the free weight area to reduce the risk of slipping and damage to the floor by dropped weights. Entertainment on the resort was a nightly event. The live bands were very good. The shows were largely dance shows with lip syncing. The shows would have been better had the dancers actually been singing the songs but the dancing was good. Because 13 years ago we had been to the Dominican Republic for our honeymoon this time we only went on one excursion \u2013 snorkeling and to Catalina Island a park off of the coast of the Dominican Republic. The cost was 180 for two people for the day \u2013 it included transportation lunch on the beach and an open bar after snorkeling. On the day that we travelled to Catalina Island we chose not to snorkel due to the wave conditions \u2013 our travelling companions did snorkel however and reported that the water was the clearest they had ever experienced. The beach lunch was very good. Our trip guides Franklin and Armando were very knowledgeable and took care of us during our excursion. The one downfall about this excursion was the washroom situation tour organizers should ensure that the washrooms on Catalina Island are better maintained and cleaned. The island is a beautiful location and visitors should not be concerned when they need to use the washrooms. The Excellence Club was selected by our travelling companions. Although they had some perks with the extra cost in the end it was considered not worth the expense. Perhaps it would be if the resort was not adult only but in this case the entire resort is only for adults so quiet away from children is not an issue. There was no difference between the quality of our rooms and the segregated areas for the Excellence Club members were not much different than those for the general guests. From what we saw and heard from other travellers about their resorts Excellence Punta Cana is the best destination in this area of the Dominican Republic. It has beautiful grounds great food staff buildings nice large pools a huge beach good entertainment and service. Overall it was a fun relaxing vacation in a grand resort setting.", "offset": [2083, 2218], "date": "2015-04-04", "cpt": "0", "category": "entertainment"}, {"id": 2, "uid": "c2b9a1fc-8467-4abb-acb6-48394a5d44a5", "sentence": "We had the best time the 7 days we were there.

The private excellence club has a well stocked bar and kitchen serving food from early morning until about midnight. Ocean view rooms have the view obscured by all the pools and landscaping that lay between the buildings and the beach. Pool service and polside bars were exceptional. Look for pizza deliveries around lunchtime at the pool and on the beach. All the food was great. The casino is small but fun. Night time entertainment at the stage is very low budget. The quality reminded me of high school plays. One good band played most nights. do not miss the fire show it is very short but visually stunning to watch.

My wife and I visited this resort with my brother and his wife June 27July 4th. After reading many reviews we were very excited to go. I have to say I am mixed on how I feel about the resort. I will start by saying the resort is gorgeous. We upgraded to the excellence club which was well worth it. The only bar in the resort besides the casino that is air conditioned which is nice due to the mosquitoes at night. bug spray works but not full proof. The excellence club has great coffee liquor and small bites and private check in out. The amenities in the rooms were very nice touch as well. We stayed in 8010 first floor. Quiet and has a nice hammock outside. It seemed much better than the 2nd and 3rd floor rooms that had smaller balconies. The pools beach service and amenities are hard to beat for the price. The language barrier could be tough at times but it is expected. Tipping was not necessary but we tipped for great service dinner maids spa etc. I did not feel tipping made the service that much better or worse except for the in room wet bar. My wife and I did a couples massage and hydrotherapy session at the Spa which was great. Well worth the money and very relaxing. Look for daily specials and you will save alot. Our main issue was the food. Just overall lacked in taste and quality which is why I ca nt score this resort 4 or 5 stars. Breakfast at the lobster house was good. After a few days of trying everywhere we settled on the sit down breakfast the rest of the trip. Lunch was so so. The pizza and room service far outweighed las olas toscana and the grill which is saying something and nobody wants pizza everyday on vacation. Dinner was good at Spice and Chez. The Lobster House was also pretty decent. The rest of the restaurants were just not good. In closing upgrade to the excellence club cause it is worth every penny they serve coronas only at agave and tell Diego the horseman and Destin to kick rocks.", "offset": [309, 424], "date": "2015-07-08", "cpt": "0", "category": "entertainment"}, {"id": 5, "uid": "bbe6f140-e190-4604-808d-3a6cc676bb16", "sentence": "First class relaxing stay.

Took way to long to write this review. I got married here and I found that when I was trying to plan this wedding there was not that much information on here. I was hoping to help clarify some of the information that I found to be very different than some of the reviews I read in my experience. First let me just say I absolutely had the best wedding ever. We had about 45 guests and to this day everyone still talks about my wedding. We had a blast. it is been a while so I am going to try my best to give as much information as possible. I had a wedding coordinator Livia. She was great. Great listener and put every detail together flawlessly few minor things but luckily I was a pretty easy going bride. I would totally recommend her. I had Alvaro with beach wedding studio. If I could change one thing about the wedding it would be the vendor for the photography. I got the highest package and literally had the photographer and videographer for almost the entire day. Yet I am missing so many valuable pictures that just were not taken. None with just me or my brother. None with my husband and my parents. Lots of missing pictures which truly bothers me. Which I guess would be my fault for not being pushy to take these pictures. I just thought there worldly be plenty of time. As we all know it goes by in an instant and I am sad that I did not have the opportunity. it is a time I will not get back. Another disappointment I found when I got back was that the best man and maid of honor speeches were barely heard over the wind in my wedding video. You can hear what they are saying. Audio should have been hooked up to ensure something like that was recorded properly. Also when I got back the DVD did not work in my DVD player. So lots of regret with the choice of vendor but that does not reflect on the service provided by the excelenceWe chose to have our cocktail hour at the cascade pool and had a 3 man trio play which was excellent. We chose to have our reception on the beach and it was perfect. No bugs. was not hot because of the nice breeze. We chose dj mania and he was excellent. We chose to get the large light up dance floor which they accented with the lighting under the table to match the dance floor. He was an excellent dj. He almost messed up our first dance song. He started with a different version then quickly changed it. But overall excellent. We got the cold fireworks on the four corners of the dance floor that went off at the end of our first dance. Overall greatWe had a cigar roller at the reception which was good however the dj failed to mention that he was there so I had to keep telling guests myself to go get them. The food. Well. I was told that I could only select one option for all of my guests. Either chicken steak or fish. There was no way I could pick one meal for all 45 guests. So I had to keep asking them to give me another alternative. I ended up getting a buffet dinner which was the best option. However the food was not hot. But to be honest luckily the dj was good because everyone just wanted to partyWe stayed in a rooftop pool room in the excellence club. Being that I have stayed in this resort with out the excellence club I was finally able to see the difference between the two. I really did not feel like it was worth the money. I liked having the excellence club lounge but maybe only because it was close to my room which was nice to grab a quick snack. I do not think the service was any different. Our room was gorgeous though. The pool was very shallow and very cold so I could not really go in. However I loved the outdoor shower. The view was gorgeousThe main pool is always clean and fun. The service is always excellent and the workers are friendly. The groundskeepers keep the grounds absolutely beautiful. Feel free to message me if you need more information. Happy to help anyway I can. I love this resort.

My husband and I typically stay at Sandals Resorts but do from time to time venture out and see what else is on other Caribbean islands. We were directed to this resort by coworkers and all I can really say is you do get what you pay for. This is not a bad review at all just a statement that resorts who claim 5 Star status have never compared to Sandals at all. they just are not on the same level when it comes to customer service food quality of the resort entertainment or amenities. This resort was very nice and again you get what you pay for so when I only paid 280 I got what I expected. The food was not what I would consider 5 star at all but was decent. The beach was nice but was not cleaned up before people started to venture out each morning from the night before. The pool is in need of work tiles broken and again. staff were just cleaning and preparing for the day at 90am. The cigar shop on site gave great deals but did not want to use a credit card wanted cash only. and when cash was attempted from the machine nothing was given yet it was taken from the bank account so this had to be stopped immediately and reported as fraudulent our bank actually said not to use this machine againthe shops were not able to use room credit that could then be paid for upon settling the room at the end of the stay. The evening entertainment was really good. just extremely hot and lots of bugs at night so bug spray is a MUST. The room was nice but again because of the bug situation you could not use your balcony at night at all.

We booked our 25th Anniversary trip at Excellence Punta Cana primarily because we wanted an adults only resort. We loved this experience and had a wonderful time. The resort is simply lovely and just large enough so that it never felt a bit crowded. There were several activities on the schedule each day and we liked that we never felt pressured to take part in anything we did not want to. In the past we stayed at Iberostar and had problems staying on our feet with all the wet super slick surfaces in fact I experienced a serious fall at Iberostar. This was not an issue at Excellence they have mostly textured walkways and very few areas where we slipped. Our favorite part of visiting Republica Dominicana as always is that we love the friendly and smiling people. Regardless of their job or financial status usually VERY poor the Dominicans value family and tend to lead a much less stress filled life as compared to Americans. They take time to visit with us and we feel incredibly connected through sharing of their experience. We were invited into the homes of some wonderful people. If you choose to interact in a respectful manner they are largely warm and genuine. Yes you should be intelligent and protect yourself if you choose to wander but we have never felt unwelcomed or unsafe anyplace we have gone. We probably are not the typical tourists though. Be aware that the concept of the Dominican minute is very real. Be flexible with expectations because it is much more relaxing to go with the flow than constantly be rushing and watching the time. Many locals are very fluent in English and other languages but remember their primary language is Spanish. There will be times when communication is more fun than others. Practice patience. The staff at Excellence really does want the guests to have a good time and come back. Thanks to David at the front desk our check in was smooth and he accommodated our requests with no problems including upgrading us to the Excellence Club even though GBS Travel had advised us it was sold out. We were seriously pleased to be offered a room right on the cascade pool. We stepped out to our patio and jumped right into the calm and wonderfully quiet pool which is actually two levels. We preferred it to the more lively usually loud and huge wandering pool on the opposite side of the resort. Our bed was very comfortable we had no problem with the window in the shower and enjoyed having natural lighting. There was a rambunctious party of 20somethings that tended to drive us crazy for several nights of pool and post disco parties but all was well when they checked out. Overall we would not have done anything different with our room except possibly book a roof top room when we have an excessive amount of cash to spend. We truly enjoyed our space. We also liked working with and visiting Will Carlos at the front desk. One of our extremely early trips left before any food options opened and we did not realize even a continental breakfast was not available until 70 am He quickly arranged breakfast delivery in the lobby. He helped us understand the currency differences assisted us to obtain my husbands debit card back when the lobby ATM ate it for the weekend and explained so many things particular to Dominican culture. He would win as our favorite staff member at Excellence this trip. Almost everyone was great but Will Carlos was EXCELLENT. The food was fine for us. There was always something we could like and the menu was always interesting sometimes adventurous. The wait staff did not always understand food allergies and therefore it was up to me to determine items that were safer. Anything we did not find pleasing could always be replaced with a different choice. If we ever went away hungry it was by our choice because Excellence bends over backwards to make the food available. We disliked the hotel beach on the Atlantic. It was very heavy surf with an overwhelming amount of seaweed. The crews worked constantly but it would be impossible to keep up with. This is through NO fault of the workers. We used the Excellence Club private beach and enjoyed the amenities. We insisted on trying to be in the ocean a couple times but decided to book some tours on the Caribbean side as we MUCH prefer the Caribbean. If you want to immerse yourself in the ocean we suggest other resorts are a better choice. We were happy to read and nap on the beach and swim a lot in the pools. Beware of the tour sales guys stalking guests on the beach and at polside who misrepresent themselves as being representatives of Excellence. They are not. Their company apparently has a contract to solicit guests. While the young man seemed good his knowledge was flawed and he sold us a package with completely incorrect tour information on the receipt. Had I not made inquiries the night before we would have missed our expensive tour by several hours. We highly suggest seeking out Jeanete Senior at Olympus Tours just off the lobby. She arranged a free tour for us to Don Lucas Cigar Factory and arranged an absolutely FANTASTIC all day trip to S Cape Park that was not her usual offering. Again another local person who made sure we got exactly what we wanted. Jeanete totally shines. Go find her you will be glad you didThey do fog for mosquitoes which was pretty necessary however we wish they would do this in the early mornings before guests are out or at least warn the guests that they will be fogging so we can leave the area. We were playing pool and ping pong when the foger came by and gassed all the guests right along with all the insects. We did not appreciate breathing in a thick neuro toxic cloud of poison. Make sure to take along bug spray you will be glad you have it. we are steady tippers for food and beverage staff housekeeping and generally for great service. it is never required but when you learn how terrible the pay is for the staff you will want to. Our drink quality significantly improved with only a buck or two. Everyone wins. Entertainment was okay but got better if you drink a little before and during the shows. They work HARD to put on a good show. It would be great if they learned to lip sync to the songs. Dancing and entertainment was great for the Circus show Michael Jackson show was our second favorite while the Dominican show was bad enough that we decided we did not want to endure the entire show. The dancers for most of the shows have impressive skill and are fun to watch. I was particularly annoyed by the entertainment team announcer. MC whatever he was. His constant demands for the audience to CLAP CLAP CLAP CLAP or they would leave the stage was uncaled for. We did not expect Broadway cruise ship or even community theater quality performances but some were just a lot better than others. The transportation available to be booked directly from the Excellence Punta Cana website is deceptive. We paid 140 for direct private round trip airport transportation which is billed to our room. There is no one to call if you have a problem at the airport they only deal with bookings via email which is not too handy at the airport and we ended up paying an additional 70 directly to a driver to be taken to Excellence. We looked for the correct reps at the desk we were directed to black shirts with pink lanyards and then shuffled over to an Island Sun rep. We decided not to make a big deal of this because we really liked the resort. The photos show nice read SAFE SUVs. We got a ride in a van to the resort. For the return trip we were supposed to be picked up at 120 resort staff called every few minutes when the vehicle never arrived then finally a broken old mini van taxi with non functional doors and broken seatbelts showed up at 1205 to take us to the airport. We were not pleased. While it got us where we needed to go we will not book the transportation this way again. Long story to say that we had an Excellent 11 day vacation at Excellence Punta Cana. Thanks to staff from the bell hops housekeeping food beverage entertainment tours and front desk. we are sure to return someday.", "offset": [6087, 6175], "date": "2015-11-20", "cpt": "0", "category": "entertainment"}, {"id": 9, "uid": "50e460ae-8101-4260-955f-3ed7ca07135c", "sentence": "Everything is Excelente. Just got back from an amazing two week stay at Excellence Punta Cana. We were greeted with glasses of champagne whilst checking in and then given a brief tour by a very happy Bell Boy Santos.

You also get LOTS of bottles of water in the room every day which was good considering the amount we drank. We thought the food was fantastic across the restaurants though our favorites were Flavor Market Tapas the French restaurant and the Steakhouse. The hotel also did theme nights twice a week where guests are invited to a buffet meal outside with entertainment. This is optional and most of the other restaurants are still open as an alternative option. Just remember that there is a dress code for the restaurants and almost all guests made an effort on this. I usually do not like wearing collared shirts and long trousers on the evenings but I think if I had worn shorts and a normal t shirt I had have felt out of place. The hotels location is perfect on a quiet bright white beach with palm trees from end to end. The ocean is a little bit on the choppy side but great if you like riding waves or body surfing. There were also always sun loungers available. This is the same for the pool areas too. if there was a towel game going on we certainly did not see it as we always managed to grab a good spot and not at ridiculous of the clock in the morning eitherWhat really added to the holiday was the service from the staff. Every single one of them we spoke to had smiles on their faces and were happy to help us always asking if they could do anything more for us. Big shout outs to Matias Santos Rafael Carlos Jhunior Julio Pedro Luis Jose Luis Jose the crazy funny bartender Jose the waiter Alexander Alby for the many mama juanas Dionisis and Arismendy. Of course there were many more as well who is names we unfortunately failed to get. Treat them well as they work so hardI am running out of superlatives to describe this place and its brilliant staff but all I can say is if you are thinking about booking this place go for it you will not regret it. we will definitely be backFel free to get in touch if you have any questions.", "offset": [658, 772], "date": "2015-12-15", "cpt": "0", "category": "entertainment"}, {"id": 10, "uid": "9182326b-2364-45a7-b598-152cf489f67c", "sentence": "WhatCEs.

We received a warm welcome and were quickly checked in. Prior to our stay I emailed and requested a top floor room. The reception acknowledged I had done this and granted our wish. So a great start. We were impressed with the size of the room plus it had a view over the Cascade pool. From reading other reviews we knew it could appear quite dated but did n\u2019t feel this. There was n\u2019t an awful lot of drawer space so had to hang most things up. We had to ask for more hangers but this was n\u2019t a problem. We made use of the bath a few times during our stay and the mini bar was always stocked. I left a note along with a few dollars for extra white wine but was just left a ton of water. This was disappointing. It \u2019s easier if you run into the chap and ask him there and then. We never had the turn down service as we were always in our room when the maid turned up but am sure this would have been a nice touch. We found the resort to be well looked after and loved we were so close to the beach so there was a nice breeze. The first week we did n\u2019t have a problem locating a bed with shade by the main pool but towards to the end of the second week more and more beds were getting reserved earlier and earlier and we had to hunt for a bed that was n\u2019t taken. All the towels were put out in the same way as if a member of staff had maybe done this. Not a problem if guests used them but when they \u2019re still empty by midday it \u2019s annoying. We visited all restaurants apart from the Mediterranean. We liked the Grill Spice and French most for dinners and the main buffet for breakfast. Omelets are a must for breakfast. These are cooked fresh and are plentiful. It was nice to help yourself to Bucks Fizz and they even had a Bloody Mary station. For lunch we flitted between all three restaurants. Sometimes we found the food to be cold if it had been there for a while at Las Olas but even at The Grill my meal came out luke warm on occasions. You can get take away boxes so one day I grabbed sushi from the buffet and ate it on my sun lounger which made a nice change. We had three theme nights whilst we were there but found the quality of the buffets to be poor. We tried one but sadly left most of our meal to eat somewhere else. The majority of the restaurants are also open on these nights so maybe if they closed them then they could concentrate on turning these nights into a real Gala with a big crowd especially as the hotel put a lot of effort into the decorations etc. In comparison to other all inclusives we \u2019ve stayed at we \u2019d never had so much choice to drink. There were bottles of beer to premium spirits so always of a good quality. A couple of bars sometimes served flat mixers so was always risky ordering a rum and coke for example as it was n\u2019t pleasant to drink. We stuck to mostly beer and water during the day and endulged at the Martini bar with cocktails Champagne and Baileys in the evenings. All bar staff were a pleasure fast and efficient. The entertainments team were lively and encouraging so there was always a crowd taking part in the games. A lot of reviews mention them by name partly because they were keen for guests to write their piece before they left the resort. It \u2019s not that I particularly disagree with their reviews but at the same time they probably felt they could n\u2019t give any constructive criticism either \u2026 the resort is great but not perfect. There were different activities most days but in the two weeks we were there we heard the movie quiz four times. Think I \u2019d have scored top marks if I \u2019d taken part on the 3rd4th time. At this resort there are no wristbands no towel cards and reservations are not required at the restaurants. It was so nice not to be tied to any restrictions and to be able to eat anywhere we liked when we were ready instead of clock watching for your sitting. We did have a wonderful time at the Excellence. It was stress and drama free with plenty of sun and good times. I \u2019d like to think I would return as the plus points do outweigh any negatives but the world is a big place.", "offset": [2995, 3100], "date": "2016-12-28", "cpt": "1", "category": "entertainment"}, {"id": 14, "uid": "3a940460-2b7f-4c0e-8272-6f1b9eae17e4", "sentence": "Great trip but. We had a great week traveling to The Excellence but this resort needs a facelift. For the same price there are much nicer resorts out there. We would love to see what it will be like after their renovations. That said the beach was amazing stretched for miles and not crowded at all. A few things to beware of. First lock your safe. We are fairly sure that we had cash taken out of our wallets during the week but did not realize it until we were checking out when both my husband and my wallets had been cleaned out of 20 bills. Since we had put the wallets in the safe when we arrived and did not move them until we left the only thing we can think is that we were not as careful as we should have been in locking it. The hotel staff came in and out of our room countless times a day. All the obvious things were left in the safe iPads laptops and we were told that the staff is checked by security on their way in and out for bigger items. jewelry but cash would have been very easy to take out. Lesson learned but very disappointing. Second beware of the people selling excursions on the pool deck. We were sold a catamaran excursion that supposedly was to be a direct transfer to the catamaran no stops at other hotels that we would snorkel swim with dolphins and swim in a natural pool like a cenote. We actually had to pick up other people so the drive was over an hour instead of the 20 minutes promised the swimming with dolphins was just sailing past the cage of them in the middle of the ocean and the natural pool was just a shallow spot where about 20 other boats dropped anchor and was a drunk fest. Totally fine if a party cruise was what you were looking for but not at all what we were sold. Before booking do your research and check out Trip Advisor. The food was WONDERFUL only complaint here is that they only have one tiny grill open during the day where you can get food in a swimming suit and coverup. Absolutely ridiculous to think a resort that caters to being in the water would expect people to get dressed at lunch to be allowed into the restaurants to eat. Sometimes the hostess at the buffet would allow you to fill a plastic container with food to take outside but sometimes people were turned away and there was always a huge wait for very mediocre food at the outdoor grill. The restaurants were wonderful especially Spice and Chez Isabele. Overall nice hotel and amazing beach. Great job to the entertainment staff especially LG.", "offset": [2428, 2479], "date": "2017-02-28", "cpt": "1", "category": "entertainment"}, {"id": 15, "uid": "3cbc44a3-6dab-4445-8cdc-bca33ded2af1", "sentence": "Always Excelente.

Nobody hassles you to join activities which are plentiful but encourage participation and you will have fun. Drinks are premium and food is diverse and delicious. Lots of veggies too. Being a la carte makes each night a dining pleasure. Although the ocean is rough wave riding and just being in the ocean is lots of fun. We found the beach to be very clean at all times. The grounds crew are always working cleaning upkeping property. Yes it does need some work in the rooms but I see continual maintenance being done. We had the pleasure of chatting with Junior from the entertainment crew and learned about his life family and enjoyment at working here.

This was our anniversary trip and we loved Mexico so much we wanted the same resort but a new place. Positives room size is massive with balcony and jacuzi bath. Although our room was block 14the furthest away it meant it was in a quiet part of the resort. Maid service mini bar mostly topped up with lots of bits and the turn down service was nice in the evening. Regularly maintained rooms. Fod variety of food and restaurants. We wished the lobster would open for lunch though too. The French and spice were the best restaurants by far and we have visited them numerous times each stay. Toscana is a good place for buffet food for breakfast and lunch. Drink plenty of choice. Quick service. Kafecafe bar by the beach is lovely for the view of the sea and also martini bar. Ask for the chocotini it is amazing. Ecological park most people do not go there but it is lovely and quiet and you get to feed some animals. We went three times as a break from sunbathing. Pols spread out. Different pools from lively near the entrance and entertainment to chilled cascade pool. All near bars too. Shops for some gifts and essentials. Nice to get in the shade and have a walk about. Not bad prices on gifts but pricey for lotions etc. There is a spa and gym but we did not go but it looked great and peaceful and lots were using them. Drink service on the beach and by the pool staff would come round and serve drinks. We would tip themBut it was pretty frequent that you could laze about and they wouldBring drinks to you which was relaxing Casino excellent fun part ofThe resort. We lost then won more back so that was fun. Moody dealers who deal very quickly keep an eye out. But good fun. Maceo bugies we had an excursion on buggies around the island. It was such fun and we drove a bit to some nice caves and beaches. Lots of people trying to sell you things but nice to get out the resort and see Dominican. Negatives Tapas awful. The manager barely spoke to us while we waited. She did not bring us a menu after asking twice. We ordered several dishes but lots did not come despite reminding politely and asking again. They gave us dishes we did not order. Only one person was serving which made no sense as other staff were around but she was the only one handing out dishes which meant service was so slow. We would have one tapas dish then wait over 40 mins for anything else. We left in the end. The food was mediocre what we had. Staf although there were some friendly staff members especially lobster breakfast staff and spice they were not as friendly and caring as the Mexican staff we had. They did not seem as genuine or happy. I know they work such long days but many did not speak to you or just said hello as it felt they were told to interact with people rather than genuine. In Mexico we did not feel that at all. Jacuzi we loved the jacuzi by the pool and beach but there was no shade at all so it was ridiculously hot. It was nice to go in late afternoon but would have been wetter with some cover. Shows some shows were poor in standards. The MJ show in particular was weak and they were not rehearsed. The love show was something we would expect to see at a 2 star resort. It was just tacky. We did not stay and watch. The entertainment staff were not that friendly and the warm ups they did before shows was a bit cringeworthy. We did a few activities and the staff did not seem bothered and were quite moody. One in particular did not speak to us while we did an activity at all and I asked her questions and she ignored me. There are lots of good reviews about her on here but we did not see that side of her at all. The circus show was amazing however and made up for the other weak ones. Layout it does need a refurb happening soon. Things are tired and a bit old. Shade Loungers there is little shading by pools for when you need a break from the sun. We had to fight for a sun Lounger in any shade. The main issue was people reserving loungers despite daily reminders from staff not to do this. Nothing was done about it. People would go out before breakfast and out towels and belongings on beds on the beach and pools. Not cool. We moved some towels one day as no one had been out or near the Lou gers and you are not allowed to reserve any anyway. Two people came back two hours later moaning they have reserved them and woke up early to do so. If the resort could manage this better somehow then that would make it easier for everyone. Anniversary breakfast we booked our special breakfast in bed but it never arrived. I chased it up but they lost the booking. This was disappointing. I think the loungers most staff tapas breakfast lack of shade are the reasons we knock it down to 35 5. We like the excellence chain and there are lots of positives but I think this will be our last visit for a while.", "offset": [1090, 1178], "date": "2017-04-16", "cpt": "1", "category": "entertainment"}, {"id": 17, "uid": "528841ed-e848-4922-a300-b9cf490b4035", "sentence": "Lovely Trip. My husband three friends and I just returned from a weeks stay here. We had a great time. We had a swim up suite in the Excellence Club. Our room was spacious and comfortable. Maid service was good. The first night I found the bed to be too hard. I asked if there was something they could add to the bed and they brought a mattress pad right away which improved the bed a lot. The Excellence Club beach service was so nice. They would lay out your towels for you. There were always people around to take drink orders but the bar was super close too. They had a good drink menu and I had fun trying out the different drinks. The bugs were a bit annoying the last few days there because there was not much of a breeze. The waves were fun to play in. The water is not all that clear and there was a bit of grass some days but it was fine. As far as the food it was good but I have had better food at other resorts. Las Olas The Grill Agave and Spice were our favorites. The Dominican pizza at Oregano was very tasty. Breakfast was good at Lobster House but sometimes it took quite a while for the food to come out. Dinner at Magna also took quite awhile. Unfortunately my husband got sick after eating there. He had the scallops. The Kitchen Table was not very good for breakfast. Many things were cold. Seems a better warming system is in order. We ate there once for lunch and did not find this to be as much of a problem. Perhaps temperature is just more noticeable when you are talking about eggs and pancakes. We had smoothies from the juice bar a few mornings since we did not love any of the breakfast spots. My husband was a bit frustrated that so many restaurants required pants and closed toe shoes. The activities and entertainment were good. We just do not really participate in too much of that. Really enjoyed the Michael Jackson show. Pool seemed a bit crowded but we like the beach much better anyway. The complimentary hydrotherapy session was great.
