First time I stayed here I would have to say it was a bad experience like many of the reviews you see here. I will give you a Hemingway fair and honest review. First off the reception staff is not welcoming at all. Been here 3 times and they do not appreciate the SPG status and are not very welcoming with the upgrades or accommodations. It is not the most welcoming experience. However the other staff members such as the doorman security bartenders hostesses etc. go above and beyond as a guest. There are always events and the lounge club is pretty exclusive but they really accommodate you as a guest. It truly is a pleasant experience when the staff is friendly and respect the fact you spend good money to stay here. The room is totally average but this is London and space in this area is costly so I can not be too mad at it. You still get the quality W bed and sleek modern hip design. In my opinion it is a great party hotel and not so much a romantic hotel. The location is amazing and with most of the staff being so helpful I would stay here overtime I come to London and would recommend giving it a shot.", "offset": [181, 235], "date": "2015-02-25", "cpt": "0", "category": "facility"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "1672115a-0302-4bc6-9568-0b38c91196ce", "sentence": "Centrally Located Hotel.

This is going to be a marmite hotel. Either you will love it or hate it. Personally I hated it but my other half loved it. The floor we were on had a load of glitter balls and dance music is being played when we exited the lift. When going into the room the bathroom is in the middle of the room and the bed is at the far end. The shower and toilet were in cubicles but the rest of the room was open plan. Its odd laying in bed watching someone brush their teeth 5 foot away from you in the bathroom. The shower was great. although no bath again a sad point for me as I love hotel baths with a big head powerful and more importantly hot. It is a great location being right in the centre of the touristy area but having to smoke in the same area and get in the lift with drunk revellers at night it can be a bit intimidating if a single traveller maybe have a residents only lift in the eveningThe beds were comfortable and breakfast was good. I recomend the scrambled eggs and bacond with maple syrup waffles you will have to have these on separate days as its only one hot choice per day to go with the unlimited continental offerings. Im not sure about the noise on the lower floors but at night on the 5 t floor we could hear street level. Although this did nt bother us it may affect light sleepers. Minibar prices are very expensive even for a hotel \u00a3 4 for a can of coke. so grab some drinks from the local supermarket and take to your room if you want a drink.

I want to mention Adrian in the guest relations who was extremely helpful and responsive and allocated us the rooms we requested. Such a rare quality in central london hotels. Much appreciated.

The lobby bar and night club are under renovation. We had breakfast at the only restaurant and it was very good though choice was limited but still enough to feed us. Staff was good. The location is unbeatable. I also want to commend the bell captains and security guards who were very friendly and helpful.

There was an island in the middle of the room which has the sink. so you wash up and brush your teeth in the middle of the room.

The hotel has a few significant virtues. 1. The central location could not be more convenient \u2014 surrounded by West End theatres the Royal Opera House and the English National Opera very close to the National Gallery and the National Portrait Gallery only two minutes away from both the Leicester Square and Picadily Circus tube stations and only a bit farther to the Charing Cross and Embankment stations. 2. The rooms are sleek modern and attractive. 3. The staff is wonderful. In fact they were so nice so accommodating and so eager to please that I feel very bad having to give the hotel so low a rating. However the sad fact is that had I known what the experience of staying there would be like I would have either shelled out the money for one of the corner rooms or booked at another hotel. I stayed for three nights in one of the hotels Fabulous rooms. I understand that the two lower ranked classes of rooms Spectacular and Wonderful are perhaps marginally smaller that the Fabulous but all three classes share the same design concept and layout. And that is a major problem the layout is quite bizarre and inconvenient. In describing the room the hotel website refers to its integrated bathroom and bedroom style that does not quite paint an accurate picture. In fact there is no bathroom. Rather sitting in the narrower front portion of the one and only room is a long ish narrow ish multi purpose white structure. Near the left end of that structure is a shallow sink. At first I thought Oh the room has a wet bar \u2014 how nice. No it is the bathroom sink. The surface of the structure extends to the right of the sink that serves as the rooms only desk table. When the website mentions the rooms oversized desk space that is what it is referring to. I gather the length is greater than in the lower two classes of room which means that your laptop will be a little farther away from the running water. On the rear side of this structure sits a high stool which is the only chair in the room that you can use when writing or using your computer. About three feet from the front of the structure is what appears to be a wall of mirrors but is actually two mirrored doors One conceals the toilet behind the other is the rainforest shower. So while all the fixtures one would expect to find in a bathroom are there they are actually in the main ie only room. The accoutrements that are usually found in a bathroom are located in the cunningly though inconveniently designed white structure. If you are standing at the sink and want a tissue you will have to go to the left side of the structure where the tissue dispenser sits at floor level. When you are finished using the tissue at the sink you will have to walk around the structure to the rear side where you will find the trash bin. In describing the rooms concept the website tries to make it seem like an alluring virtue rather than what I believe it was an expedience a way to fit all essential elements of a room into what is actually a rather small space without giving the room the appearance of being cramped. In so doing the site has made a few misleading statements. For example it says you can relax in our wonderful bathroom. As I have pointed out there is no bathroom wonderful or otherwise and there are only two places where you can relax in the general area where the bathroom fixtures are located sitting on the toilet or taking a lengthy shower. But you will not be able to relax in either of those places because both are equipped with motion sensor controlled lighting Whether you stand or sit in the toilet you will be in the dark before very long and will have to flail your arms about to turn the light on again that is madeningly annoying. And if you had like to luxuriate under a rainforest shower you had better do a rain dance at frequent intervals lest you be cast in darkness the lights went out when I was simply adjusting the water temperature. I had one of the engineering staff increase the time setting on the sensor but that accomplished very little. Motion sensors are a dumb idea in a hotel room. The website describes the bathroom as equipped with concealed mirror doors for maximum privacy. Well there is absolutely no privacy. Before entering the shower one must get stark naked in the main only room and of course one leaves the shower starkers directly into the main room only this time dripping. The two people sharing a room had better be in an intimate relationship \u2014 or at least they should be desirous of having the relationship turn intimate real fast. The web site touts privacy for all three classes of rooms that I have cited in fact though only the Cool Corner rooms and the suites have separate bathrooms. And regardless of the nature of the relationship between the two occupants they had better abandon all hope of having a relaxing conversation in the room as there is only one chair and it is situated diagonally across the room from the stool. The room is equipped with a Nespreso cofemaker and a mini bar but there is no way the two people could sit together over coffee or cocktails \u2014 or over anything as there is no table other than the flat surface of the white structure and that could not accommodate two chairs stools even if the room had them. Though the room layout was the biggest problem there were other deficiencies. One of the features of hotel living that I always look forward to is a buffet breakfast served in gracious surroundings. The W Hotel offers breakfast in a casual restaurant located on the ground floor of the W Hotel building but not managed by the hotel. It would not be an appropriate setting for a meal in a three star hotel let alone a five star hotel which I was astonished to discover is the Ws rating. I had breakfast there my first morning and not again. There is no proper lobby. The reception area and concierge desk are located on the first floor one story above ground level. Extending to the side of this area is a very long bar with as I recall stools on both sides and perhaps some small tables along the wall. Between the elevators and reception area are fewer than a handful of chairs. So if you want to meet a friend in the lobby you or he will probably have to stand until the other one shows up. Compounding this problem is that the hotel uses that long bar area and environs for private parties that translates to very loud very crappy music and a crowd of loud maybe drunk people if you have to stop off at reception for something on your way up or down it will be difficult to speak above the din. That also means that the ground level entrance to the hotel is roped off to a single door and getting through it past the security staff is an unwelcome ordeal. A security guard would not let a friend of mine past to meet me in the lobby until finally a more civilized and intelligent staff member intervened. My stay coincided with the holiday season so the private party problem was probably worse than it normally is but it was like that each night of my stay. I realize that this is a terribly long commentary but I wish someone else would have given me these details when I was considering booking. And I recognize that quite possibly the things that bothered me so much will not bother you at all.", "offset": [6135, 6211], "date": "2017-12-25", "cpt": "0", "category": "facility"}, {"id": 10, "uid": "fdc963fd-52c2-4505-ba58-1bac20fe1098", "sentence": "A pleasant stay only impacted by the excessive noise from the music levels.
