The lobby is beautiful and so is the pool. Book a room with a water view as it is stunning especially when you have been trapped in the cold and snow of the north. I felt it was totally worth the extra money. The food is excellent and so are the drinks. I really enjoyed the breakfast buffet as it offered a great selection and locally sourced foods. I was pleasantly surprised. The housecleaning service was timely and did an excellent job. Every staff member I encountered was very pleasant. The pool area is gorgeous and they could probably make more money if they staffed it with waiters instead of just the bartender and self service. The Rum Runner was delicious. The bartender was very nice and handled the pressure well. Several lampshades in the hallways were cracked and the rooms need a major update. But considering that you do not need to spend much time in your room it was not all that noticeable. The valet situation is very hectic and unles the manager was on duty helping them they seemed clueless as to how to direct traffic especially on a busy Sunday with check outs. If you need your car quickly call ahead and wait down on the street or you will get trapped in the mayhem. I got out of my car on Saturday to ask some people checking in to move up so I could be on my way to St Pete. It is not rocket science. I would definitely stay here again for the hotels prime location service and breakfast buffet.", "offset": [823, 905], "date": "2015-03-25", "cpt": "0", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "61f4d741-f2f4-4a40-85f8-f0067597b5ba", "sentence": "Excellent location and beautiful views. I was here for a work conference and professional training that was held at the convention center conveniently located next door. The beds were very comfortable and the rooms were fairly standard and kept clean. The staff was very helpful and courteous. The restaurants within the hotel were great however the grill did have super slow service. I originally booked a room with 2 double beds and changed it to one king bed. The rooms with 2 double beds actually looked a little bit nicer and larger in my opinion. The pool third floor was really nice and there is also a fitness center and spa on the same floor that I did not have time to utilize during my stay. The hotel was very nice for a business trip with excellent views of the marina. The hotel is directly near the convention center and Amalie Arena I even got to catch a hockey game while I was there and in close proximity to the Florida Aquarium. The trolley that takes you to Ybor City and the aquarium is worth checking out costs 5 per adult per day 250 one way just watch the suspense times at night and there is a trolley stop directly in front of the hotel. If you wanted to check out the zoo it is off of the beaten path and cost us 20 for a taxi each way so go with plenty of people if possible or rent a car. I did not rent a car while I was there but I did hear that the valet parking was pretty pricey. The wifi was great which we also got for a very discounted rate since we were there for the conference. I would say that the rooms carpet in some areas are showing some signs of wear and tear and could use some slight updates but overall the hotel is excellent.", "offset": [1519, 1676], "date": "2015-04-26", "cpt": "0", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 2, "uid": "11e257fa-b55c-4256-854f-1afb078f2ca1", "sentence": "average.

I called the front desk to complain and was told that this was scheduled maintenance that would be going on all night and that there was nothing that they could do about it. I have spent all day working at a convention across the street and will be having a long work day tomorrow.

I was travelling with my husband who was the one that was attending the convention so I had to find other things to do while he was in his meetings. The Embassy Suites allowed guests to use their pol very tiny with limited seating and no place to get something to drink unles you went downstairs to the lobby bar. The only plus about their pool was that it was heated. Very disappointed but the Mariots pool area was very nice in the past and I am sure with the overhaul it will be even nicer. it is just tough to be in 80 degree weather with no where to get cooled off.

My only complaint is the management and level of staffing. I checked in mid afternoon on a busy Saturday with many events going on in the hotel. It was about 245 pm and we were trying to rush to the game but there was a line at the check in desk of at least 30 people and only 2 people working. We did not end up getting to the game until after the puck dropped which was disappointing. However the young woman that checked me in Mary Margaret was incredibly sweet and apologetic for the long wait. She handled the long line very well despite not having the support needed.

First I want to say I have stayed at this property several times in the past and always given it top marks. When I learned that it was one of the two host hotels for the Gay World Series September 2 8 I was thrilled. The hotel went out of its way to make us feel welcome by among other things adding two bars in the lobby and adding a food station in the lobby since Champions is closed for remodeling. Additionally they gave us 25 off valet parking 21 vs 28 and took the unusual step of offering self parking usually valet only for 20 a night recognizing that a large number of participants would leave at the same time each morning. Anyone who is a Gold or Platinum member knows that the Concierge area at a Mariot can be hit or miss. This one is and has always been a total hit. The main reason is that the morning representative Carl Fuller has been there for over 18 years. He is a delight and remembers everyone and takes his job very seriously. Joyce Brown in the evening has been there about 15 years and is also sweet and wonderful at her job. The food day and night is plentiful and delicious. The Concierge level is closed after breakfast on Friday until Sunday night but if you are platinum they give you vouchers for a very extensive buffet in the restaurant and you can bring one guest per voucher. As to the rooms a total score. Very comfortable beds beautiful furnishings and an upscale bathroom. Safes and refrigerators in every room. Due to a situation beyond my control I ended up in four different rooms as the one I was promised in advance was accidentally given away prior to my arrival. But eventually I scored Room 2401 which has a balcony about five times the size of the room with sweeping views of the water and surrounding area. Besides Carl and Joyce I want to recognize Sabrina Bracken and Martin Watson who is a Guest Experience Supervisor. Sabrina went to great lengths to ensure I had a great time and Martin did everything he could to make my stay enjoyable. One quick tip. At booking request a room facing away from downtown. They are currently constructing a JW Mariot virtually across the street and my friends that had rooms even numbered said that it could be loud at times.
