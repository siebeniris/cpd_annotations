I could not get any sleep even with ear plugs in all night. Such a shame because this really is a lovely hotel.

The nice thing was that when I called the front desk to complain they offered to reimburse me or take me out the next day to replenish them. I did not think it was worth the trouble so I declined. But I got a phone call a few minutes later to ask again if there was anything the hotel could do to make it up to me and when I politely declined again they offered me 500 Hilton Honors points. So I guess that is customer service for you. But it is been 2 days and I still have not seen any points come in yet. Later I noticed that my gum floss pick was also missing from the bathroom. They must have just swept it off the counter and into the trash when cleaning the room. I have little faith in the room servicing staff now. Even later I noticed was that the two rolls of toilet paper were down to nothing and not refilled nor were there any spare rolls provided. Last straw was when I realized that the cleaning staff had thrown away my only pair of earplugs. I had only gotten 11 hours of sleep the first two nights and I still had 2 nights to go.
