We shared a room w two queen beds. The room was clean and spacious for four of us and included a refrigerator so we could save some money on small meals and snacks. The concierge was extremely helpful and gave us some great ideas for how to spend our time. We rented bikes from the resort used the pools walked across the street for easy access to the pharmacy and late night food pizza. The resort is very easy to find and has beautiful garden or waterfront views not beach front. Parking is free and available something not common in Key West. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The resort is about 2 miles from most of the tourist action and there are lots of options for getting around. Everything in Key West costs money so be prepared to spend lots of money.

Accommodations have been secured at the public parking lot next store in front of Walgrens. Facility is close to Roosevelt Blvd. however concerns about street noise were unfounded.

Rooms are one bedroom 2 queen beds. Or a suite with a king bed bathroom sitting room on one floor with outside decks and a queen bed with closet and bathroom upstairs. TV in each bedroom as well as the sitting room. Although we chose an upstairs suite when sitting outside we were still under shade cover. Accordingly use of the deck throughout the day is possible. Grounds are somewhat unique. Rooms open to sidewalks around the perimeter of the pool garden area. Each sidewalk is labeled for easy navigation. Sidewalks are bordered on each side by white fencing. Center of the grounds contain 4 or 5 medium sized pools all linked by canopied pathways. Lush vegetation similar to jungle motif effectively screens lounges from view from rooms or neighboring wading pools. Concentration of bathers around a single pool is limited by the pool deck seating area additionally in a subtle manner holding down noise levels. Vegetation is carefully cropped to maintain a forest clearing providing direct sun partial or full shade around each pool throughout the day. In spite of heavy vegetation did not notice much or any insect activity around the pools or on the decks. An outdoor bar table area is spacious partially undercover. Food menu is limited but okay. Occasionally too long to get food beverages are served quickly. Open 8 8. Get to know Shelley a real pro in the bar business continually on the move with excellent sensitivity to customer needs.
