This was our 2nd island on our Hawaii island hopping trip and I was slightly disapointed in this hotel. To be fair the first island we stayed at a full service Mariot resort and the 3rd island a Luxury Collection resort. Still I would like to write what I thought was good and not so good about this Courtyard. Check in was ok. Not a long wait. No valet or luggage help offered. Room was upgraded from garden to ocean view for mariot silver. The hotel is dated and needs a remodel soon. The room feels claustrophobic because windows are small and bathroom is so small you can barely close the door without hitting the toilet. The pool is nice but NOT HEATED which is disappointing. It is too cold to swim in. Everybody went to the hot tub which was a large hot tub but crowded. Nice fire pit next to pool but it is so crowded with only a few seats we never got to sit there. Free Mai tais at check in but they were very basic seemed like just orange juice with rum. Did not taste like Mai tais at other resorts. Breakfast buffet at this hotel. It is barely any better than a continental breakfast and at almost 30 a person it is way overpriced in my opinion. I do not mind paying a premium price for food if it is fresh and tasty. But this food was not very fresh and had limited selection for the price. Tried the food in the evening at the bar and it was a little better. Surprised how early everything shuts down on kauai and at the hotel. Good luck getting food after 10 pm. Next time I will be staying at the full service mariot on kauai. The Courtyard offered a good room rate but expensive food and resort fees make it am ok value in my opinion for an ok hotel.", "offset": [476, 520], "date": "2015-03-01", "cpt": "0", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "e89b9753-d983-40bd-980e-f58ef65b0376", "sentence": "Average Good value for the price. This hotel was pretty average but a good value for the price. The plus is that we had a great view from our room their pool area was great and the location is excellent. However the rooms definitely need updating. The decor was very dark outdated and cramped. The view from the room was great but the lanai is designed so you can not even really fit one chair out there if you want to actually face the ocean. The bathroom is also very cramped. It was almost impossible to not run into the toilet when at the sink or stepping in and out of the shower. They also had some off putting policies in place. Guests are required to hand in a towel card to get towels each day when they go to a pool and also get a different color wrist band each day to use the pool. Also laundry is on the premises but it actually consists of one washer and dryer on two floors which mad it tough to get access when it was not in use. Service was OK. We did not have to interact with management too much but one night we did request a couple of things brought to our room. This took much longer than promised and then they arrived without everything we requested. Also parking tended to be an issue because they had multiple events open to the public happening on the premises every night. Several nights this was definitely an issue for us. Overall if you are looking for a low priced hotel in a central location this is not a bad option.

I will try to not exaggerate too much in this review but I will be honest that this is one of the worst Mariot hotels that I have been too. The entrance and lobby will fool you because they are very nice and well decorated but the rooms are at least a decade overdue on renovation. Stay away from Room 484. Under the rate that we booked we were supposed to be given an ocean view room. We could see a sliver of the ocean if we stepped out on the patio and leaned over to the left. The room that we were given had visible water damage that did not look like it was properly addressed when it occurred. The room itself also felt very humid and had a musky smell. This is a much larger Courtyard than those that you might have experienced on the mainland US so could be a 5 min walk or so from the lobby to your room. We did not try the on site restaurants or the pool hot tub but the resort amenities did look nice. If you compared the loby pool areas to the rooms you would think that you were staying in a completely different hotel. The staff seemed joyful and was very helpful when they were needed. The hotel charges a 20 amenity fee which includes parking beach chair rental and two mai tais.

There is a bistro near the pool with pub food not too bad. Did not eat dinner in the restaurant but instead went out or had activities. Room OK tiny balcony barely fit 2 chairs this was the partial ocean view. Typical shower tub toilet arrangement. Furniture in disrepair could use a serious overhaul.

I feel this courtyard does not get the respect it deserves. ALL of Hawaii is expensive and most of the hotels are out of date. This courtyard offers a nice place to stay in a great location for a reasonable price compared to other Kauai hotels.

The staff working were overall nice but I would not say excellent service of what I would expect at a Mariot property. I would know as I used to hold various positions at Mariot when I was a college student such as working the front desk reservation call center to working as a host in a lounge. The location is great being beachfront but it is on east side of the island which is not as nearly as nice as being on the north or south shore along with terrible traffic and not many great options to eating out in the area. You would need to drive 30 minutes away to eat something decent. The rooms were terrible which had a musty smell with outdated furniture and carpet that look like decades old. Although they are currently undergoing renovations but do not hold your breath of getting a renovated room even if your a Mariot rewards member. The AC was too loud. The night we came they were blasting music into the late evening by the pool area which made if difficulty for us to get any rest to prepare our day early the next day. Would not recommend this property to anyone unles your budget conscious and just need a place to crash. 260 per night before taxes and resort fees was what we paid and surely regret every hard earned money we spent.

One or two towels every day had some kind of stain spots indicating they did not clean them properly. The hotel is on the windiest beach on the island. The beach is nice but you can not really enjoy it due to the wind. The wind never stopped for the entire time we were there. This might be a reason to the tree to be so leaning away towards the hotel. The beach is windy the pool side is windy as well you can not find a place to avoid it no matter where you go. The fire pits around the pool are lovely in the evening but again with so much wind is hard to enjoy even a single drink. The tiles around the pool the breakfast restaurant and the lobby was quite slippery. There were a lot of signs about that but that can not prevent slipping. Why they put such a slippery surface tiles when they remodeled the pool yard. Overall very disappointed stay at this hotel. Definitely the service was not up to SPG standards.", "offset": [1172, 1320], "date": "2020-01-16", "cpt": "2", "category": "renovation"}]}
