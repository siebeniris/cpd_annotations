The hotel bar closed at 10pm on a weekend and the staff were not happy about serving us as it got near closing time. Certainly not a party hotel.

Stayed here with my wife and two kids 15 17 August. Booked late so could only get a Standard dune facing room. Firstly Le Touquet if you are booking to stay here I guess you already know how stunning the area is and the beach especially. World class and just 50 mins from Calais ticks every box for anyone that lives in Northern France or south of England really to start withWe were going to just to Air BNB but last minute this was actually a cheaper option. Paid \u00a3 150 a night room only fopr the standard dune facing room and that accommodated the four of us just about. King bed and a decent pull out sofa bed for the kids. Wish I had booked earlier now as months ago I could have probably have got the gorgeous ocean facing room for the same price. Definitely worth doing whatever you can to book the ocean view the views from anywhere facing the ocean at this hotel are simply stunning. You will be forgiven for thinking about turning around on the approach to the hotel in a car. The exterior of the actual hotel building is horrible. Like a grey prison except for the adjacent spa where the huge salt water pool is which is very modern in a full glass pyramid design. So the two just do not blend very odd looking property. But free parking and lots of it. The hotel was full when we stayed and there were still spaces available. However step into reception past the Tesla charging point there were quite a lot of Teslas there actually as well and the lobby is modern and fresh. Lobby has a little putting carpet with golf ball and putter and an xBox with 2 controllers to keep the kids happy when passing through reception. The main restaurant is straight ahead of you with glassed off panoramic views of the ocean and main bar down the steps where you can eat a snack full meal or sit on the beach terrace and gaze at the incredible ocean views. Before I forget. dogs very popular in Le Touquet allowed on the beach and in the hotel. Dog friendly hotel. Interesting. did not bother us we love the four legged darlings and opted not to take ours on this particular trip but great to know we could have. Check in is from 4 pm so we went straight to the pool for a swim. From what I can gather the pool and the huge Thalasa spa centre are separately owned and managed. The Novotel joins it from one side and the Ibis from the other side so shared facility for both hotels which is a HUGE plus point. Lovely big pool but it is saltwater so warn the kids. Few red eyes when we got out. Again amazing view of the beach from htere and paragliders flying past the payramid shaped glass windowWe only ate breakfast in the hotel. it is EUR1850 per adult kids free so not bad at all and is a just the standard Novotel breakfast same breakfast as in any Novotel. Limited hot options just bacon processed scrambled eggs and chipolata sausages but the fruit and pastry bread selection was plentiful and very tasty. Couple of coffee stations but tea was a bind as they didnt seem to have any regular English Breakfast Tea so unles you wanted a fusion tea herbal tea or Earl Grey you were a bit out of luck. The beach is what it is all about though Incredible. Walk down the steps or down the dune the hotel is situated upon and you are on miles of powdery white sand beach. On a hot summers day you would be forgiven for thinking you were in the Caribbean. Really is stunning. And as the hotel is west facing towqards the coast the sunset was incredible on a clear night. Loads to do locally. About a 20 min fast ish walk into Le Touquet town wher there are numerous bars restaurants and shops. The nearer to Rue St Jean you are the pricier but we found the best restaurants there I have to say. There are numerous more cost effective options if you walk 5 10 mins away from that area just look on Trip Advisor. There is also a Carrefour City store just off Rue St Jean in the town which is perfect if you want to get stuff for a beach picnic. We got bread pate chese ham and some wine for about EUR13 which is very good value. All in all a superb mini break. Hotel inside was great staff friendly and it functioned very well. The pool staff were quite friendly the spa staff were not friendly at all unfortunately. Forgive the exterior book an ocean facing room and you will be very happy.", "offset": [1086, 1219], "date": "2017-08-22 00:00:00", "cpt": "0", "category": "fitness"}, {"id": 7, "uid": "ae9a1d0c-68a5-4a6f-8a62-6620981f79ce", "sentence": "Avoid if only staying for one night.

We stayed at the Novotel whilst in the area and were looking forward to staying at a high end spa hotel. Firstly the positives the hotel is in a great location Le Touquet is beautiful and the hotel is right on the sea front. There is also ample parking. The parking is advertised at \u20ac 17 a car per 24 hours but thankfully I was not charged. Now the other parts for me the Novotel brand is a mid to top end brand and I do not mind paying more for that. in this case \u20ac 180 for the night standard room. After a straight forward check in we arrived at a small damp smelling room. The view of the dunes was actually a view of the car park with some sand in the far distance. The room was very dated and boiling hot. The bathroom sink did not drain either but the shower was excellent and very powerful. The bed was comfortable and if it were not for the heat we had have slept well I think. The spa consisted of a pool with a great via of the beach. The pool was full of screaming children and had no jacuzi sauna steam room that i d expect from a spa. It felt more like a public leisure centre than a relaxing spa pool. We did not eat at the hotel but instead went down the road to Cote Sud which i d highly recommend. a Michelin star type of place but good portions and reasonably priced. Would certainly return to Le Touquet but would not return to this hotel unles it had been completely revamped and had a proper spa.", "offset": [913, 971], "date": "2017-09-10 00:00:00", "cpt": "0", "category": "fitness"}, {"id": 9, "uid": "ff0b30d8-382b-4d16-bd6f-2fcb6d37f052", "sentence": "Half term golf break.
