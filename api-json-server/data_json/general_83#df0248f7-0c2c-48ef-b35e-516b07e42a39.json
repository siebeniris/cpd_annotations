For example they changed the door numbering so there are new signs for the door numbers on the walls next to the rooms. But the numbers used to be on the doors and you can see that they used to be there. The glue from the numbers is still showing. Plus the walls showed many signs of not being repainted. The mattresses and frames were shaky and noisy. I had a hard time adjusting the heat and making sure it was going on and off to keep the room at the right temperature. In the end took patience.

Hampton Inns are our preferred hotel so we stayed at the Hampton Inn during our stop in King of Prussia. We found it to be disappointing compared to the many Hamptons that we have stayed in.

It looked out on the Pennsylvania Turnpike as do all rear facing rooms and the road noise was noticeable the tissue dispenser in the bathroom had only a couple of tissues and there was no backup box and the pillows were awful. There was no distinct business center. Instead there was a kiosk with a single PC and a printer off to the side in the lobby. This was inadequate in our opinion.

Stayed at this hotel one night before meeting. The hotel is easily accessible off West Dekalb Pike near the King of Prussia mall.

The staff for checking in was friendly and helpful but that is about all I can say was above average. I got a room on the 6th floor and in taking the elevators I learned quick that they were hot and slow. The room itself was fine. You can see that they are a bit worn out around the edges and the toilet was in rough shape but nothing that makes it unlivable. However the room was very warm do you see a theme here for the entire hotel as the temp was 74 degrees when we walked in. The setting was on 68 so it shows how poor the A C is. I turned it down to 65 and by time I got back from dinner and an errand it was only 72The bed was comfortable and large and the pillows were adequate. When I woke up the temp was only at 68 so it is safe to say the AC is just awful. I went down to breakfast and was wholly disappointed. The food they had was just plain bad. They had some sort of omletes that were clearly microwaved and then some sort of crepe type thing that was disgusting. Obviously it is hard to mess up bagels etc. so they should just save their money and keep those things stocked. Overall I would suggest looking elsewhere first.
