I suppose that it is true that a first impressions really ARE the ones that stick with you and my first impression of the Ritz Carlton in St Thomas was not a good one. I arrived with a group of friends. we had 7 rooms total in desperate need of vacation for a short 3night stay and was so excited to be greeted with a tray full of tropical drinks. It did not take long to realize that the drinks are really there just to hold you at bay while you wait FOREVER for your room to be ready. There was absolutely NO order at the front desk area they just kind of ask you to sit and call you back as they see fit. We arrived as a group and therefore should have been processed as a group but this was not the case and somehow new arrivals kept getting taken care of BEFORE us which I thought was absolutely ridiculous. They just had us sit in the seats nearby and asked us to wait but it is absolutely infuriating to watch others get taken care of who arrived after we did and be carted off to their rooms before you while you wait for THREE hours for your room to be ready. After a long flight and drive from the airport the absolute LAST thing that I wanted to do was wait at the front with my luggage. Anyway by the time my room was actually ready some of our group waited until 53060 to get into our rooms. I was so frustrated tired and upset from my experience that I literally stayed in my room for the rest of the night I just did not want to be around anyone. They offered us a free meal and some minimal 200 room credit in exchange for our experience but when you are paying 90 a night that does not really cut it. We are talking about 210 just in rooms that our group spent for the three nights that we were there so you would think that perhaps they would have gone above and beyond. Nope. We hired cars as well from the airport through them so they knew what time we were arriving and STILL did not have rooms ready. Come to think of it I also had issues when booking the cars I called to make the reservation and they were totally not helpful. Just told me to go to their website and book it. No instructions or help just go to our website. When I asked where to FIND it on the website you would have thought that I just asked the lady on the phone to run a marathon. Trust me. when my clients call me up with service requests no matter how small or irritating I NEVER sigh back at them as though they are being a pain. I travel very frequently for business and pleasure and have honestly NEVER encountered this type of situation and especially coming from the Ritz Carlton it was just unreal to me. As for the other parts of the experience the rooms were nice clean and I especially liked the bathrooms. There was no minibar as I had seen advertised elsewhere just an empty mini fridge so was slightly disappointed there. The staff for the most part was VERY kind so no complaints there. Breakfast was average nothing really special especially for the price. The pool area and beach were very nice I really liked that the beach rentals were included so that was a very nice addition. The restaurants that I tried were tasty with very friendly service. Honestly if we had not gone through that entire ordeal in the beginning it probably would have been a much more pleasurable experience but I am used to outstanding service when staying at resorts of this caliber and this just was not it. So incredibly disappointed. Not the relaxing experience I was so desperately in need of. Unfortunately still in need of a vacation after my vacation.", "offset": [3023, 3147], "date": "2015-04-01", "cpt": "0", "category": "pool"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "e9d40de7-115a-4063-a1c2-e2586fc0f518", "sentence": "Flawless Service Completely Perfect minus the drunk business men at the convention. I am a Ritz Gold member and I absolutely can not say enough about the staff at the St Thomas Ritz. I would give it a 5 star but I can not because of a situation which I will explain later. First I will list all of the positives. It was our 21st anniversary trip. Check in was great and we were escorted via golf cart to our tower. The property is absolutely incredible. We stayed on the Club level with a balcony. The views are absolutely spectacular. I can not say enough about it. The room was roomy and all of the amenities were amazing. The decor was flawless and the room was perfect. The balcony was huge with amazing patio furniture. Club level The club level was heaven on earth literally. The rum bar. Are you kidding me. The food was spectacular too from breakfast to appetizers the rest of the day. There was a full day of rain and we spent most of the day in the club level. It was fantastic because of the rum and the views are incredible. We missed breakfast upon checkin by 15 minutes and the staff promptly brought back out some dishes that had not been put away yet. Are you kidding me. Incredible. We stayed for two days at the beginning and end of our trip to the VIs and between then they stored our extra bags for us. Are you kidding me againThe landscaping is nothing short of amazing. Flawless and gorgeous. The pool area is expansive and awesome. several different pools with wonderful views of the beach and ocean. Another example of excellent service was an incident that happened to our friend who was also staying there. He was on a padleboard in the water and slipped and his feet both landed on top of a patch of Sea Urchin. He ended up with over 300 sea urchin needles in his feet. He was in the worst pain of his life and the staff quickly responded. During this time someone from the Ritz Carlton staff DROVE TO THE STORE to get him Epsom Salts and Vinegar and brought it to our room so he could soak his feet in it. Are you kidding me again. Amazing. Now to the only negative. There was a business convention going on and there was a party for it going on in the room above us That we were paying 10 night for. It was incredibly loud both above us and coming in through the balcony. I mean LOUD and it was 2 am. I called the front desk and it took about 30 minutes for anything to quiet down which at that time was only about 30 more minutes until they picked back up again. 4 am the party was still going on and they were super drunk. I had to call the front desk 3 times to complain about the partiers but it just felt like they were able to do whatever they wanted since they were there for a convention. When paying 10 a night and traveling for your anniversary vacation you want peace and sleep. There was none of it for two particular evenings we stayed while this convention was going on. I would not hesitate to stay at this incredible property again but I would ask in advance if there was a convention going on because I would NOT stay there if there was. It really ruined the peace of our vacation and made sleep difficult.

First of all my gratitude to the many ladies gentlemen at this property. I would like to mention some of them like Greg and staff at Sails Mike and team at the pool Tameka on the beach the entire beach activities crew Ryan for teaching me how to sail the entire Club level staff cleaning ladies Vance for giving us rides the ladies at gift shop and jewelry shop. Most certainly a property is also about the people they can make or break your stay. I took a moment to read some of the reviews here and I see a common factor we all notice how this property is in urgent need of change and updates. I see some guests found the place 5 stars but Ritz Carlton people know that is not true. I am not to compare to our recent stays in Tokyo or Hong Kong since it is another concept however the attention to detail from those places should be the same specially in Club Level. I will compare with Caribbean destinations like San Juan Aruba and Cancun where I have stayed. There are many little things all over the property coming out that by now they are not little any more. When I was here few years ago I do remember the lack of manpower everywhere I understand about budget and scheduling but you can not sacrifice quality. Now even the food is hit or miss like another reviewer said. Quality of service is down but do nt blame the warriors on the field sometimes just one attendant for the pool and beach. Most definitely if you pay for Club level provide Club level service. YES I had to ask for everything I should not. Plates were piling on each table poor ladies can not handle it. One night they brought some person to show sell jewelry there was no tables or chairs available for guests. Who is going to seat outside with 10F The AC in the whole property is dying the food at Club always melted or did not have right temperature. I understand there is no kitchen and you have to bring it from some other area but that shows lack of coordination with staff. One day lunch was not ready until 1230p someone forgot to bring the food. Chicken wings. twice in a row. Once again this is not to blame staff they do what they can with what is provided to them this is higher I blame the top. All the alcohol is hidden and quality is less I do remember they had Johnny Walker black Chivas and Bombay Sapphire when I went 3 years ago now red Jameson and Tanqueray. And many examples like this. I will go back because the location is very relaxing the staff is very friendly I will not book Club Level since it is not worth it and I will eat out since it is way overpriced for quality.

Our room was nice although being a Mariot platinum member I had expected an upgrade but we were tired from traveling and wanted to get to bed fairly early. Oh no not possible the live music from Sails was so loud it sounded as if it was right outside our window. Oh and our room had a lovely view of nothing but Sails restaurant on the other side of the swimming pool. In the morning I called the operator to ask about taxis. No answer. Tried 2 or 3 times let it ring and ring. No answer. Finally got wise and called the concierge who answered right away.

The addition of Birthday cake platters and champagne upon arriving to our Villa left us all amazed with the level of detail attention the Ritz staff adhere to. On top of that they even managed to somehow source out my girls favourite cookies for a birthday surprise. The uber comfortable beds and pillows will make you not want to get up and moving but once you do you will get to enjoy the majestic surroundings they have situated this 5 star hotel within.

Average meal for three was 100 no drinks. Pools are very nice and we had no trouble getting chairs. Wait staff at the pool was very efficient and friendly. It is a large property so prepare to walk and it is not flat. Almost 12 a mile from our room to fitness center. But we got used to it. My main issue was extra fees. I had to call the front desk every other day for them to explain why they were now holding 60 for a 300 room. They apologized but the hold did not expire until after we left.

Getting there We thought about booking a car service but opted to just grab a cab outside of the airport. It was easier than I thought. We hoped into a passenger with a slew of other people and headed off. The cost was 15 per person since we were sharing with so many other people. They made one stop before dropping us off but that was not a huge deal. Arival Britani checked us in and was super friendly. During check in we were greeted with Rum Punch. There were also 2 water dispensers in the entry one with cold lemon water and the other with cold lime water. Our room was not quite ready and Britani was very apologetic. It was only like a 5 minute wait and not a huge deal to us. After we checked in Sheldon took us by Club Cart to our room D Building 235The rom. The room was a good size and the bed was actually one of the more comfortable beds I have slept in while traveling. The room consisted of a bed oversized chair 2 night stands. table desk area w 2 chairs and dresser containing small fridge and topped with a large TV and a Nespreso machine. There was also free bottled water which came in handy. The bathroom had an oversized tub double vanity walk in shower and separate water closet. There was also a patio with a small table 2 chairs and a lounge chair. Finally a good sized closet w safe we did not use plenty of hangers 2 robes an umbrella for personal use and iron ironing board. My ONLY complaint would be that the bathroom needed more hooks to place towels and robes. Grounds This place is HUGE. There are 2 main areas. Resort side and Resident side. I can not tell you much about the resident side. We walked over to the resident side and there was cornhole more pools billiards table tennis etc. We were welcome to use the amenities over there but never did. The beach on that side has public access. The resort side is where we were most of the time. Fitness Center WOW. Really good set up. There were free weights weight benches treadmills elliptical machines weight machines blocks ketlebels steppers yoga mats and more. They also provided ear buds cold water bottled and water dispenser and towels. Restaurants Bleuwater we had dinner there the first night. Both dishes were really good. We also had breakfast there daily. It got a little boring but nothing we could not deal with. Yes the buffet is expensive but we were welcome to take some of it to go. I regularly took some extra fruit back to the room to snack on later. Esenza We never ate there. I just could not eat such heavy dishes after a day in the sun. They do however have a full bar. This came in handy. I could only do so many of the overly sweet fruity beachy drinks. Sails Super low key. Tim was the best bartender. He was helpful personable and really made it a fun place to hang out. I was disappointed that they were only open 2 evenings a week but that just made me want to eat there for lunches. Zest I walked in but there was not really anything that I fancied. They do have smoothies frozen yogurt and breakfast sandwiches. it is also like a little mini mart with candy sun screen bug spray little toys etc. Water Beach towels sunscreen SPF 15 30 and 50 cold water to drink After sun aloe vera and bug spray are all provided. Had I known I might have not packed Aloe and sunscreen. Pol Good size. Open 24 hours. We only got in it once but it was really nice. There are also a ton of lounge chairs side tables and umbrellas. Beach There are plenty of lounge chairs. There are also side tables intermittently between lounge chairs. The water is calm and we spent a ton of time snorkeling. We saw the most fish over in the rocks between the resort side and the residence side. Water sports As I said we did a lot of snorkeling. I ended up borrowing a mask from the Water Sports area. I had brought mine but it was new and did not actually fit my face. We also took kayaks out daily. My husband used the paddle board. These were all included in the resort fee. Everyone was very helpful when it came to borrowing equipment. Shopping. do not forget to stop at Jewels and get your free gift. I did it as we were leaving. There was no pressure to buy anything. I did not even browse. I just walked in with the card you will get it at check in and asked for the gift. It was definitely worth it and a nice little something to take home.

The property is massive and there are many hills. I am usually a self sufficient traveler but I am glad there was a porter and a shuttle to get our luggage to our room. All the rooms open to the pool or water view it did not appear that there is a bad view to be had. We dined in Esenza and found a serious bar surprising for the Caribbean. and a solid menu. We enjoyed everything we tried especially the breads house made limoncelo and ice cream trio that included a chocolate malted milk flavor. Denis and Tim at Sails on the beach are the perfect Caribbean bartenders. They learned my husbands rum preference on the first drink and kept him well hydrated with his favorite while offering tastes of other rums they thought he would like. The drink specials polside were a good way to try something new. The infinity pool overlooking Great Bay is a great way to spend an afternoon. There were plenty of rafts and chairs available. I enjoyed the sparse crowd in September but imagine the pool becomes pretty busy during season. Housekeeping at this property deserves a call out they kept our room immaculate while being completely unobtrusive. Turndown service every night was also a lovely touch. If you are in to sailing do not miss either the champagne sunset or day trip to Jost on Lady Lynsey passport required.

This vacation was a girls trip for my sister my mom and myself. I questioned whether or not to write any review but by the last day the 3 of us all agreed I had to. I will start with the amazing stuff. We had a Club Level room not the RC club just club level at the hotel. Our concierge manager Taylor S was absolutely amazing. We had emailed prior to the trip and she was able to set us up dinner reservations taxi airport shuttle services and had a bottle of champagne in our room waiting when we arrived. The Club Level room had amazing food for breakfast lunch and dinner and snacks in between from 7 am until about 10 or 11. At all hours we were able to have any alcohol we wanted. This was all included in our hotel club Level rate. The hotel grounds were nice and our suite was beautiful with an amazing view Room 46 in Fresia Tower. The ease of just renting a paddle board snorkel gear and kayak was amazing we just signed a waiver on the first day and then every day just walked up to the desk on the beach and asked for what we wanted to rent and walked away with it. So nice and easy and all includedIn addition all the staff everywhere was extremely nice. The people working with the towels on the beach the bartenders waitresses club Level staff etc everyone so nice and helpful. Anytime I requested extra items from housekeeping they were always given in abundance. Thank you. The concierge manager in the main lobby was very helpful in setting up our Sea tosails dinner for the first night and has excellent taste in shoes Loafers just like I had onYoga was amazing. I did it 3x with Elen and it was a solo class 2 of 3 times. She was an excellent instructor and the view was amazing. It was nice having brand new yoga mats and a view of the ocean. Having a free private yoga class on vacation was amazing. Thank youNow the awful stuff in all the contact we had with the hotel leading up to our vacation not 1 person told us the entire pool and hot tub was under construction. We were able to use the RC Club pool but it was on the entire other side of the whole complex and you could either walk this long distance fine for me and sister but not for my mom or have to wait for a shuttle to take you all the way there and then wait again for another shuttle to get back. Ok so fine at least we had options. However sitting on the beach at our hotel was unbearable. The drilling and banging on the pool was non stop from 8 am until at least 4 pm every day. It was so loud you could hear it at the other beach far away and the waves did not drown it out at all. They did not even have any chill out or nice music to overpower the heading banging drilling sounds. My mom is not a big fan of the beach sometimes but knew this vacation would be just right because the pool is right next to the beach. My sister and I also love to take quick dips in the pool or swim later at dusk but we were not going to walk all the way to the club pool just for a few minutes of pooling. If we were forewarned about the pool we would have tried to make a vrbo reservation at the RC Club and not at the farthest tower in the Rc Hotel from The available pool. In addition we knew it was off season but 2 of the restaurants were completely closed from August until November giving us only 2 choices to eat on the grounds of our hotel. We were also completely shocked that this Ritz Carlton has no shuttles of any sort to transport between airport Red Hook or anywhere at all. We had to pay 100 EACH WAY for a taxi shuttle from airport to The RC for a 25 minute ride and 18 each way for 3 people fromRC to red hook when it was just a 6 minute drive. If that. The taxi ride for 3 people from the Mariot to Red Hook which is about 25 28 minute drive is 20 each way. Upon check in we were told we would have the club Level service and a concierge dedicated just to our room however when I actually asked if we could have a bottle of wine delivered from the club Level in stead of all 3 of us needing to go down to the club and each get 2 glasses of wine and go back up to our room we were told there is not enough staff working now to have anything delivered to our room. The cleaning service had an issue every day. The first day we were out of our room from 8 am until 4 pm and no one cleaned. We got a knock on our door at 430 by housekeeping to clean our room and she acted disgruntled that we were there and said she was running late so she did not want to go back downstairs and wait for us to leave so either she starts now with us still in there or we do not get cleaned. Since she was so late we never got turn down service that night which is not a big deal but it was not our fault she was so late. The second day we were back from dinner getting into bed around 930pm and housekeeping knocked to turn down at about 94pm which I thought was late to have someone knocking on the door. And as I sit here writing this review the sound of the drilling has been going non stop and so loud. It takes away from all the beauty of the nature sounds birds waves etc. and calamity of the vacation. The fact that no one warned us of this situation is just horrible. Goods over bad this was an amazing vacation and the 3 of us had an amazing time amazing view and amazing service from all the staff. Thank you RC and special thanks again to Taylor Sanders. You were so good to us and very helpful.", "offset": [1874, 2043], "date": "2016-10-20", "cpt": "1", "category": "pool"}, {"id": 17, "uid": "56e53ef2-0157-490e-b32d-ddb3fb51eaf8", "sentence": "Great Location for St John BVI. My wife and I stayed for a week in Mid October. I have seen varied reviews so hopefully some perspective will help especially for first time visitors. St Thomas The airport is 45 minutes away. You need to either take a cab rent a private car with driver or rent a car to drive yourself. A cab is usually a 10 12 person van which will take multiple groups till it fills up. That means stopping along the way at various hotels. The cost is lowest. A private van or car would be 90 120 each way. Car rental varies but can be difficult navigating as they drive on the left and have limited street signs. We paid for a private car with driver. We met a couple that rented a car and they said it took over two hours to get to the resort. The Ritz Carlton does not provide transportation. Resort. The Ritz Carlton Resort is made up of multiple buildings spread out along the hill overlooking Great Bay and you may find yourself walking a good distance. The terrain is hilly but they do provide resort shuttles for those that prefer not to walk. Shuttles are golf carts driven by staff. The sister resort next door is the Ritz Carlton Destination Club and you can use the Services Amenities. If you are interested in visiting St John and any of the BVI this is a great location on St Thomas. Room. We booked Resort View with Club Level. The room had a great view of both the garden interior and Great Bay. Based on the hotel set up everyone has a view to the Great Bay but some are a bit better. I posted pictures from the room so you can see. Everything looks exactly like pictures on the Ritz Carlton website. The room bathroom were great. The Club Level provides food and drink from 7 am to 10 pm. We had a buffet breakfast with an omelet or fresh eggs each day. Lunch some days and snacks and adult drinks all day into the night. The offering at dinner is hors doeuvres so not what most would want for a meal. Later evening is small deserts. Dining. the Ritz We ate lunch at Sails twice and Coconut Cove at the Ritz Carlton Destination Club twice. Both were good with no complaints. Serving size was large in our opinion. We were not able to finish our lunch. Viola Sails and Al at Coconut Cove provided excellent service. I do n\u2019t recall the names of our other servers but the people working there were great. We also ate at Bluewater and Grand Palazo Club and both dinners were very good. Note you need to pay via credit card at Grand Palazo Club as it seems to be leasing space at the Ritz Carlton Destination Club. Amenities. Beach is soft sand and little to no waves as it is on Great Bay. The snorkeling is very good and you can use the non motorized equipment as they included in the resort fee. Paddle boats Stand up paddle boards Kayaks Hobie cats Windsurfers and Snorkel equipment. The pool was being resurfaced while we were there. So we did miss having the pool but we could use the Ritz Carlton Destination Club pools if we wanted. We liked the beach but a couple days the noise from the resurfacing got a bit loud. We did n\u2019t use the fitness center. Day Trips. We took the Red Hook Ferry to Cruz Bay in St John. Note it runs on the top of the hour. We arrived at 1005 am and had to wait an hour for the next ferry. We rented a car and drove all over St John. Ate at Skinny Legs in Coral Bay and visited Cinnamon Bay Trunk Bay and had dinner at The Beach Bar in Cruz Bay that night. I would definitely recommend going to St John. We also booked the Lady Lynsey day trip to Jost Van Dyke and White Bay. They pick you up at the Ritz Beach. It is a full day trip with a snorkeling stop followed by an afternoon soaking in the Soggy Dollar Bar in White Bay. Snorkel gear is included. Lady Lynsey is the Ritz Carlton Catamaran but is operated by Cruz Bay Watersports. Thoughts. We really enjoyed our trip and the resort but you have to understand when going to places off season they may be doing repairs or some things may be closed. For example we wanted to eat lunch on St John at the Canel Bay Resort Beach Bar as part of a day trip. When we arrived at the gate we were told the resort was closed for two months as it is off season.", "offset": [2871, 2972], "date": "2016-10-26", "cpt": "1", "category": "pool"}, {"id": 18, "uid": "40c2f7cb-fb68-4789-a963-a0e7d0e2f077", "sentence": "WARNING.

Wow we just had the best vacation ever. This Ritz is outstanding. We could not have been treated any better. We were here for 5 nights for our 25th wedding anniversary and they knocked it out of the park. From the second we arrived to the minute we left it was all fantastic. We had a private balcony room with a great view of the ocean St John and surrounding islands. Looked like a movie screen or postcard but even better because we could hear the waves and smell the ocean. The color of the water here is indescribable. So clear and pristine. The grounds here are beautiful and well maintained from the lawn to the flowers to the buildings. The infinity pool is out of this world and the beach is so nice and relaxing. We sat in the pool and looked at the view for hours. We never had to fight for a lounge chair at the pool or the beach. Every single person we came in contact with at the resort said hello how is your day is your vacation going well do you need anything. WOW. Have never seen anything like it. We started each day off with breakfast at Bleuwater. We had the same table and I had a wonderful omelet that Juliana made. it is such a lovely breakfast buffet all the food is fresh and tasty with interesting and plentiful selections. We want to thank Eclwige Sarah Jakesha Jenele Marie Michele Maragret and Pretax from Blewater. Great job. Then we would generally head to the pool or beach. We chartered a boat one day by Sonic Charters with Captain Gus. It was a blast. I will do a separate review on them but if you rent a boat stop by Corsairs on Jost Van Dyke and say hi to Capt Viny. So much fun. We ate at Sails very good. The chef came out and talked to us because I have a gluten and shell fish allergy. He was so nice. Took lots of time to make sure our meals were perfect. We also ate at Esenza. Again the chef came out so impressed with Chef Norman. We had the gluten free pizza and it was amazing. Jack the bartender was very cool and gave us lots of suggestions and good drinks. Manu Manikandan made us an awesome anniversary surprise. great memory. On our last night we went to the Caribbean buffet at Coconut Cove. OMG not your regular buffet. The 3 different kinds of freshly grilled fish were so fresh and the steak was mouth watering. There was live local steel pan music playing and we sat outside with a perfect view of the water and surrounding islands. Was a perfect evening. So many people to recognize here. You can tell that this is a very well run resort. So that starts with Mr Ortlam and his staff. Big shout out to Joan Floyd who arranged so many special touches to help celebrate our anniversary. Huge thanks also to Kamila Dabrowska who greeted us and went out of her way to make sure we had a great time. They were both awesome and made the trip so memorable. Would also like to give a round of applause to David who drove us to our room a few times Destiny Edwige who served us at Bleuwater Juliana who cooked our breakfast and Mr Ian McPhe who also greeted us. Honestly this vacation could not have been better. Thank you Ritz Carlton St Thomas for an out of this world experience. You should be very proud of your team.

We stayed at the Ritz Carlton in St Thomas for 3 nights in June. We were able to find a good rate relatively speaking with a AAA discount so we booked the club level. The service was flawless my impression was that no request would be regarded as unreasonable. The staff was beyond pleasant going out of their way to provide anything a guest could need this applied to staff at the pool in housekeeping and in the club lounge. Our room was spacious and well appointed with a lovely large balcony that also offered privacy however the room alone is not extraordinary despite the price the bathroom on the other hand is you have a lovely soaker tub great shower etc. At this price however why no bath sheets instead of those small bath towels. And the hotel robes will not fit a normal man or a larger woman. The club lounge was just down the hall. It is a hike from most rooms to the lobby though so you have to either call for a golf cart or plan your lobby time strategically. If visiting Charlotte Amalie for shopping or dining is important to you know that you are at least 30 minutes away from the city after spending 12 hour there we quickly decided we were not going back so that was a non issue for us. The infinity pool was great but I thought it was rather small for the size of the resort in terms of its number of rooms. It was often noisy and it was best to grab a chair early whether at the pool or the small beach. The childrens pool was tiny. We were a traveling as a couple and at first wondered why so many children were in the adult pool but quickly realized that the childrens pool could fit only a few toddlers. There were many floats and other swimming items as well as boats and boating trips available. I feel that at this price point no one should have to fight for a chair at pool or beach and for the number of rooms at this resort the pool should be larger. Because we had the club lounge we ate there primarily. We quickly realized how much food and the high quality of food available there. In the morning for example there was scrambled eggs bacon sausages individually ordered omelets fresh fruit granola cold cuts cheeses. smoked salmon bread pastry of all types any juice coffee tea you could want. Pancakes. No problem they would make them for you. There were always items just for children too. During the day there were unlimited alcoholic and non alcoholic beverages of all types. Lunch and dinner too offered a huge variety of food. Two of our three nights we at dinner primarily at the club lounge and just grabbed a gourmet pizza with wine at Esenza. We ate one night at the Coconut Cove Caribbean buffet which was about 58 person. The food was good there but not outstanding. The setting was lovely it was just nice to eat outside. There was music though no dancing so it really did not extend our evening at the dinner. Service was fine. it is a bit of a walk from the Ritz hotel but then everything is. Again we saw some people being transported by golf cart which we did not request. On a nice evening the setting is lovely. Generally though we liked our plan of eating most meals at the club lounge and then grabbing a pizza much better than it sounds. This really is gourmet true Italian pizza at the Esenza bar. A shoutout to Jack the bartender who was a charming older man who gave us great service. If you are not in the club lounge and it is expensive again we had a great AAA rate so if you are not going to use the bar in the lounge to save on alcoholic drinks rather than paying 12 16 drink at the pool it probably is not a good value for you know that the food here is fairly expensive. The least expensive restaurants were the pool grill not open for dinner and the Coral Cove restaurant which on nights other than Thursdays has a regular menu. Again the service was flawless. We received a card the night before checkout indicating that the club lounge concierge would print our boarding passes for us if we supplied our flight information which we did a very nice touch. To summarize while certain aspects of this resort are lovely but not extraordinary the service is absolutely outstanding. We gave this resort 4 stars rather than 5 it would have been 45. because the room was wonderful but not outstanding certain attributes like the towels and robes were sub standard and the pool was ordinary but with that in mind I would recommend this resort highly and suggest searching for a AAA or other discount rate like the one we booked.", "offset": [292, 457], "date": "2017-06-26", "cpt": "2", "category": "pool"}, {"id": 24, "uid": "6e186f4d-edc2-4aca-9638-79f6950ab8e1", "sentence": "Ritz Carlton Hotel July 2017. The staff was excellent at The Ritz Carlton in St Thomas. The beach was good not great. The sand on the beach is soft but once in the water it is rocky and there is a lot of sea grass. There is a 78 resort fee per room per day this gets you access to all the water sports equipment Hobie cats paddle boards snorkeling gear kayaks etc. You must first sign a waiver and then it is no holds barred. Great bay is excellent for all these activities. Semi enclosed bay with no dangerous wildlife. The pool was great and the staff could not do enough for you. The towel service is also exceptional. No counting towels and giving your first born for an extra towel. The staff actual will periodically roam the pool and beach area and swap out damp towels with fresh dry ones. We had no problems getting beach or pool chairs everyday. The room was nice. We had a Garden View which was fine. The room A C was powerful and the ceiling fan was great on low. Each room has a balcony but after dark you will need bug spray. Each room as a can of Off bug spray. There is a safe in the closet of each room. The bathroom had a tub show stall and double sink. The only complaint was that there was no exhaust fans vents which made the bathroom get really hot and steamy. Especially after a hot shower. We had a king bed and it was very comfortable. The food was good but very pricey. I could rant about the prices but I suggest you look at the restaurant menus on the website before booking to budget out your meals. You may spend the same amount for the room as you spend on drinks and food. We ate most mornings and a little store onsite call Zest. They have breakfast sandwiches bagels smoothies and sell convenience store items. Still pricey but more reasonable. This resort is on the East End of the island and there is a little town called Red Hook close by. It is a 5 per person taxi ride one way. 30 round trip for a family of three. Red Hook has a handful of dining options. We went to the Caribbean Saloon 3 nights which is mostly pub style food but they do have entr\u00e9es on the menu. From Red Hook you can catch a ferry to St John. The ferry is 7 one way and takes about 20mins to get to St John. The ferry runs every hour from 9 am to 11 pm. If you go to St John a must is Trunk Bay Beach. I would rate it as the best beach I have been to. The best time to go downtown 16 per person taxi ride is when there is a cruise ship docked. I have ben told that not all the stores open if there is no cruise ship docked. All in all the Ritz was great but the overpriced food and drinks was kind of a downer.

A few other hotels let their patrons on their own. So let us all give them a break and say thank you by staying at this Ritz. It is wonderful. So what there is some noise now and again. They are making it beautiful. Second the service is still the best. Everyone that works there is kind and they know the Island. If you want to eat at the Ritz you can but you can also get reservations made for you by the front desk staff and they know all the great places. Third the rooms are spotless and ever so comfortable just like they always are. They are not going to put you in a destroyed room. They are fixing them. Fourth the pool area is great and so is the beach. Go there have a blast and have fun.", "offset": [1269, 1319], "date": "2018-11-16", "cpt": "3", "category": "pool"}, {"id": 30, "uid": "c488e9e4-79e5-4b48-bf6c-6868351348f0", "sentence": "Room was not clean hair in the drawers in the bathroom limescale mold in sink mixer and shower handle holder.

I really do not like giving average or negative reviews especially in this case because the staff is super kind. I just feel like the hotel needs to be aware of some things. First of all we had a very welcoming greeting when we arrived. We were brought drinks immediately upon our arrival while we checked in. After check in they gave us an additional. It was a sweet gesture to start our stay off right. During check in we were told that we would be given a 200 resort credit per night because the hotel still is not completely finished. This was a great surprise and a very kind gesture. We were in Puerto Rico staying at the St Regis over Christmas before we came here. it is hard to not compare the two. We read TripAdvisor reviews on this hotel and our expectations were not very high so being told we would be credited was a very nice surprise. We arrived at our room and while it was okay it was not anything fancy. Much smaller than the room we stayed in at the St Regis. Beds were comfortable and we had a deck which was nice. Although the Ocean View room we had was more of a view of the construction of the pool. We did not spend time out there since it was mainly construction. As for the shower in the bathroom it seems odd that it is frosted glass that you can see into the main room. So you can see someone showering or at least the shadow of them. There was also light from the shower so if others are still sleeping in your room its not dark. Being a Ritz I would have expected better. The first night we ate at Coconut Cove. Nakita was our server and she was very friendly. My husband ordered a seafood pasta with Lobster mussels clams and shrimp. My daughter and I had the chicken pasta. The chicken pasta was absolutely delicious both my daughter and I loved it. As for the seafood pasta there was no lobster and barely any mussels or clams. It was mainly shrimp. When my husband questioned it the manager asked the chef and he said he was out of lobster. That is fine but they should have told us that because it was 14 more for the lobster. They offered to take it off our bill but my husband said no it was still good and since he ate it he suggested to just charge him like it was a chicken pasta which they did. I am only pointing this out because of what happens a few days later which I will talk about below. The guys and gals working the pool were super friendly and helped get your chairs set up. Christmas is a busy time but we never had issues finding chairs. There were plenty. Lunch at the pool took over an hour to receive which seemed like a long time so just order before you are too hungry. Most restaurants require reservations before you arrive because when we got there they were all booked for dinners. The breakfast buffet restaurant near the pool was good although you could tell the wait staff were extremely stressed and overwhelmed. The second day we ate here there was quite a wait. We told them we would be waiting outside and they said they would come out and let us know when our table was ready. As we saw people behind us in line getting seated my daughter went up and questioned and the lady was not very kind and said we have been calling your name for awhile. My daughter quickly reminded her that we told her we were waiting outside since there was no room to wait inside and that she agreed to come out to tell us when our table was ready. They sat us next. New Years Eve lunch we decided to eat at Coconut Cove again because we wanted the chicken pasta. Nakita was our waitress again and we were happy to see her. My husband ordered a bacon cheeseburger. She asked what kind of cheese and he said swiss. She came by our table shortly later and my husband questioned if saw that it said bacon on the cheeseburger. She said he was accurate and there would be bacon. So out comes his cheeseburger and my husband jokingly said this is the orangest swiss I have ever seen. Nakita felt bad and said she would take it back and fix it immediately. My husband told her no it is not a big deal he likes cheddar too. She leaves and my husband realizes there is no bacon. So when she comes back he tells her and you can tell she is completely embarrassed. She brings the bacon. My husband then started eating the burger and after a few bites he realizes there is something in his burger. Sure enough it was the wax paper that divides the cheese. He calls Nakita over and she looked mortified. She asked to put it on a plate to show the chef. My husband was done eating at this point. When our bill was brought to us we thought for sure they would take his meal off especially since my husband did not have them take off the pasta off the first night like they asked. We thought it was only fair since he had wax paper in his burger that he be comped that. So he scratched off that part of the bill and did a new total. When we received our final bill we saw that they did make the adjustment on their end which was good however it should have never been on the bill in the first place. That night we went out to eat in town. When we came home there was a bottle of champagne and a very kind note from Nakita. That was great customer service and they definitely tried to right their wrong. We were thankful for that even though we do not drink champagne. On our last morning there we had to get up early for our taxi and when I went to shower I realized the staff that serviced our rooms forgot to leave us any fresh towels. They took all of our old towels during turndown service but forgot to leave new towels so we did not even have hand towels. It was about 7 am and I called housekeeping and they never answered I called the front desk concierge and they never answered. Since we all needed to be up and showered it was quite frustrating no one answered their phones. I had to call the bell desk to ask for towels. They said they would be right up. They arrived at 830am. Luckily our flight was delayed by several hours so it was okay it took them so long for the towels to arrive. I do feel there should always be someone available answering phones for guests though. We were eaten alive by the sand flies so be sure to use the Off they have for you near the pool. My daughter stopped counting at 100 bites on her body. Red bumps welts that were super itchy. Ok back to the good. The water is beautiful there is coral and rocks in the water but we still got in and my son and husband did some snorkeling. That was fun for them. The sand is super soft and when you are not looking at the pool construction the view is stunning. I loved looking out to St John. I would return. I just hope they get some of these kinks worked out soon especially when I had to use more than the usual points for our stay for a hotel that was not quite ready.

To be perfectly honest I was a bit skeptical after reading some the reviews here on TripAdvisor. However St Thomas looked like the picture perfect place to spend our 10 year wedding anniversary Mother and 2 children in tow. We rented a beautiful 3 bedroom condo on the resident side. Check in was easy and quick. The welcome cocktail was a nice addition. Our bags were brought to the room in a timely manner by a very nice gentleman whom we looked forward to seeing during the remainder of our 5 day stay. He was just a real gem. Room was very clean and any issues that did arise water was not warm enough to run a bath one evening was VERY quickly resolved. Every employee we encountered was lovely and kind. I really can not say enough about Delta she really went above and beyond to make our vacation one to remember. A piece of beautiful cake and a bottle of wine was a equisite touch as well as a touching hand written card delivered to our residense for our anniversary. We booked a boat rental with Captain Dan on the resort but unfortunately the weather for our day did not cooperate. My Husband enjoyed chatting with him during our stay. can not wait to return to get out on the ocean with him. We spent a lot of time by the pool and beach and while yes the beach is not great for swimming. Its a short distance to impecible beaches our favorite was Magens Bay and sweet spots Captain Dan recommended. We did find some not so rocky spots on the hotel side towards the right side for the children. I also think if we had swim shoes it would have been just fine. Remember also mother nature has done quite a lot to this property in general over the past few years. They have done a tremendous job bouncing back. The family pool on the hotel side was of course under construction but did not bother us. The view from the infinity pool is picturesque and service was great. Staff stopping by to clean sunglasses and give ice pops was a nice touch as well. We were all sad to leave. All in all very satisfied and my family and I can not wait to return.
