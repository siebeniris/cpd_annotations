We had a wonderful stay and highly recommend staying at the Portola. The rooms are very clean well stocked and very comfortable. The furnishings are comfortable and contemporary. Overall very reasonably priced with lots of amenities to enjoy either in the building or nearby. The hotel is child and pet friendly and for us that is important as we travel with both our dogs were welcomed by the staff as much as our 8 year old daughter was. The location was fantastic and right in the heart of down town Monterey which made it extremely easy to venture out from to walk our dogs. The area is safe and clean and well lit for a nighttime walk. A bonus is being in the heart of the downtown historic area of Monterey which was a joy to tour around and visit the historic sites. The staff was absolutely the best you could ask for. All we encountered were professional pleasant and just genuinely nice. All took the time to ask about us and how our holidays had been and if we needed anything to ask and they would certainly take care of us. Room service was our 8 year olds favorite and was spot on when we placed an order. Considering we ordered room service for New Years morning and the tray arrived on time and piping hot says a lot about how customer service is approached at the Portola. Our daughter was so excited about having breakfast in bed she actually woke up on her own as the food was delivered hats off to the staff for making that happen. The local nearby restaurants were very good including the two in the hotel. We ate at both and I recommend them both you will not be disappointed. We ventured out on New Years eve and had a fantastic dinner at a nearby and well known Japanese Steak house and what a wonderful treat that was. Highly enjoyable time and also staffed with very nice people. My wife enjoyed a massage at the Portola spa and absolutely loved the two hours she was pampered. We spent several hours over our weeks stay in the heated pool and spa which was a nice feature if you have kids that want to go swimming in a heated pool. The pool and outdoor area was clean and well lit the towels were all fresh and clean. We will be staying again next year at the same time. We met some wonderful very friendly people that only enhanced our visit. On the last night of our visit my wife and I had a drink in the hotel lounge and sat out in the lobby area where we chatted with other visitors and even a local couple out on an evening walk. They use the lobby to pass through on a regular basis because of its charm we would do the same if we lived in Monterey. If you have children you have to take them on the Portola Hotel pirates treasure hunt adventure that is quite fun for parents as well just ask at the desk and they will help you with a treasure map. Finally the walking path that hugs the harbor was outstanding. We strolled along the path on New Years day while watching the bountiful sea life frolic in the sea we stopped along the way to grab some lunch and found our way to numerous local shops and even a small outlet mall. We bought things from the locals and the outlets so it was a win win for all. We do not have a negative word to say and hope you enjoy your stay as much as we did.", "offset": [235, 331], "date": "2015-01-05", "cpt": "0", "category": "facility"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "7e5e2502-3dad-48b2-ad92-f1d3529e4aeb", "sentence": "Nice stay for business.

My husband 17 yr old daughter and I stayed here in June as part of a driving tour of the California Coast. The best review I can give is how thoughtful and helpful Amanda from Housekeeping was when I called a few days after leaving to ask if she had found our daughters MacBok. We were so distraught about losing such a valuable item. Amanda had placed it in the hotel safe when she found it and gladly shipped it to us when we called to claim it. We were so grateful she had been honest and caring about our daughters computer and expensive carrying case. On arrival we were pleased with the beautiful circular entryway and the lovely ambience of the large lobby. The lobby also opens up to several nice shops which are part of the hotel building.

The property is lovely with a nice gym and pool and is also within walking distance to a lot of cute shops and restaurants. The rooms were a little pricey for their size but very nice regardless.

She told me they have a nice quiet room on the other side of the hotel if I did not mind the distance. We did not mind. After the walk and 2 separate elevators we arrived to our room. A corner unit on the interior of the hotel. Our view was another rooms window and a concrete courtyard with no view of anything. Thanks for listening.

Pool was nice but small and often crowded and you have to leave the main hotel and cross the plaza to get there. The obvious downside was major construction of the attached conference center and preparation for the upcoming Concours car event. Very loud most of the time we were there for one or both of these things. We also had someone check in next door with a dog that started barking at 730 AM. Most of those things are not really within the control of the hotel HOWEVER they could have eased all of those inconveniences with some simple customer service gestures. Customer service was really lacking and given all of the abnormal interruptions to a normal stay the hotel made absolutely no effort to soften the experience. Most of our interactions with the front desk staff were curt and less than friendly. At checkout in particular my husband noticed we had been double charged for one day of parking. The clerk at check in had said we were being charged 8 day for parking partly due to the inconveniences from construction. The checkout clerk said it was supposed to be 19 day and it seemed she was going to adjust our bill upwards for every day stating that our check in clerk was wrong and she left the hotel anyway. She also said the check in clerk had already given us a reduced rate for one of our nights we were not given any reduced rates for any of our nights we were only given what rates were advertised through the hotel.
