To me it represents a higher standard the the average hotel. If I ignore the fact that the lobby is a few floors up from the street and there is no one greeting you at the door. The looks and feel was not really good. However the Lobby looks nice on the surface but if you start to look into the details then you start to notice there is alot of small tear and wear. When we arrived we got told we could not get the rooms we had checked into from the web. And we had to wait for 4 hours. After 4 hours we still could not get into the rooms because they were not cleaned yet. After some going back and forth we had to accept what we got. The elevators. oh the elevators. They must be really old. In one of the elevators you could see into to the shaft. There is some holes down in the corners. The certificate in one should have been renewed a few months ago. We were wondering if the buttons are working correctly as you could push and push before something happened. The walls in the corridors are not straight the look like some downhill slalom course. Doors are scratched and the pipes to the sink had leaked some time but never got cleaned. However the cleaning were actually other then that pretty good. The closet looks like it were fr some horror movie and I am pretty sure you could just rip the safe with you. The bed was really comfy and alot of the others from my party liked the pillows. They were good but not really what I personally like. Not sure if there also is some issues with the fan in the bathroom because it took some time to get the moist away after you took a shower. I really liked the shower. Good pressure and heat. Also a issue we ran into was that you could hear you neighbour or when pl walked in the hallway. One of the rooms we had were just next to the elevators and they could hear that ding noise it does on ever floor. The breakfast was also really good. Most of the staff were real nice. Never had dinner in the Bride restaurant but we did have a bite in 1602. Not really a good experience with staff or food drinks. The water and sodas were stinking of chlorine and tasting it. It felt like the water is straight from the pool. They screwed up the orders and one time we had to wait an hour for ice cream. It gets real loud and there is not alot of seating if you are more then 4 people. The pool area were lacking some love but the few times I were there it felt ok. Alot of the chairs needs to be replaced but hopefully it is in the works. I understand they have done some renovations so it might be on the list. The area around the hotel is very strange. You have some real nice buildings and then you have a Ferari store. Around the corner you have homeless people and it feels really unsafe at times. It was my first time in Miami so it could just be me not used to this. I would not recommend anyone to go there and stay a week like we did. A night or two I guess is ok. That tram is real close and some buses. So t was pretty easy to get around even if you did not want to drive or take a taxi. So if Hilton could manage to fix alot of the details I would easily say it is a 4. But comparing it to the Hilton in Dubai down at the beach or the Hilton in Stockholm.

VIEWS VIEWS VIEWS. it \u2019s a gorgeous hotel but there \u2019s not too many things to dazzle you here with. We got there around 7 pm and were taken into the downstairs lobby. There were plenty of people downstairs to direct us up the elevator so that was no problem. Once we got upstairs we checked in with no problem. The lobby is beautiful. It \u2019s modern and gorgeous. Up the elevator we go and get to our room. It \u2019s just a standard room. It was well updated and clean but a bit of a let down after that lobby. The bathroom was the nicest part. Lets talk about the view this room had. Spectacular. We decided to go exploring and saw the roof top pool which was as great as it sounds. We then wanted to venture to the Grand after hearing there was a walkway. This is where it got weird. We had seen ONE sign that it was on a certain level so we go there and take a guess to walk outside to the parking garage. We then take an elevator walk across the dead garage walk through the creepy sky walk to a building that looks like an abandoned mall. There were stores downstairs but the whole thing was really strange. Also there were a maximum of two signs the entire way. Anyone could get lost and I \u2019m not sure how you would feel walking around at night alone. Another problem was the elevator. When checking out it was almost impossible to get and elevator. All were super packed. Some people would ride it up just to eventually come back down. When I was booking this hotel I asked if there was a shuttle to the cruise port. They said there was and that it was 6 person. Not a huge fee so we were okay with it. When we got there though no one mentioned the shuttle and when we asked there was some confusion. We ended up taking an uber which was 15 for 5 people for 3 person. I think a hotel of this caliber should offer a complimentary shuttle or at least a cheaper one. When checking in they gave us the information for the wifi. When we got to the room the wifi was n\u2019t working. After 15 minutes of frustration we called the front desk and they explained that wifi was only free in the lobby. How does a hotel in 2019 not offer free wifi. Even low end hotels in the middle of Times Square offer free wifi.

I read all the reviews and I was n\u2019t sure I wanted to stay here but my admin booked my room here and I actually like this hotel. The elevators were a little confusing. There was one set to get to the street level and valet and one set that takes you to the rooms and to the conference area. But the set in front of check in would take you to the conference area too and the street level. I am not sure I actually figured that out the entire few days while here. The hotel had a resultant and bar area. The food was decent. Room service breakfast was extremely slow well over a hour and a half for bacon eggs and toast. The roof top pool area is small but fine for an afternoon of relaxation. The room was updated and clean. Nice shower. My room was higher up with views of the water and cruise ships coming in. Very close to port. I have stayed in many hotels some that I never even get to get to write a review on because I do travel so much. I usually only review the really good or the really bad. The okay I just leave if I \u2019m short on time. I must say this hotel had the most comfortable mattress I think I have ever slept on in a hotel. I was really impressed with the mattress for a Hilton at that. I know there \u2019s more upscale hotels in the area but this one was very close to where I needed to be so that \u2019s how I usually pick them. I will probably go back just for the mattress if nothing else and ask for the same room. Crazy I know.
