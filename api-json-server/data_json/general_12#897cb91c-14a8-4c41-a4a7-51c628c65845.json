I came to this hotel as our friends were getting married around the corner. Check in was 2 pm we arrived at 230pm. The room still was nt ready. I was a little worried as i need to get changed and hurry to the wedding. Final they found a room for us. I do nt see why this should of been a problem as check out is at 12. Anyway with the added stress on arrival we final got in to our room to the smell of damp. Not having anytime to switch rooms we had no choice but to hurry up and get ready to go. The next day i had ordered breakfast to our room. The food was terrible not even edible The food was like rubber. Cheap sausages and processed food yuck. \u00a3 22 for a full English and i did nt even eat it. Coffee was ok but still not great. I do nt mind paying the price but i do mind not beginning able to eat it. The shower had no screen on the bath. So the bathroom floor was covered in water. This is probably why it smells of damp in the room. Also it s very dangerous with water all over the floor. On check out we tried to let the receptionist know about the shower screen and the smell of damp but she just ignored what we said. We said it twice. We were nt trying to get money off just help them improve there room. even though looking back now we should nt of paid especially for breakfast. I do nt know why we bothered they did nt care. I did nt even say about breakfast. We paid our bill and left as we could nt be bothered to get into a debate and i know they would of because that s why she was ignoring our complaint about the shower screen. I just wo nt ever go back again and thought i d write on here. Also one more thing our room was dirty. There was also somebody s old tissue on the floor. YUCK. I did nt think i was staying in Mayfair that s for sure.

Stayed here for a week out of 3 weeks of my business trip. The location of the hotel is right smack in the middle of Mayfair and a short walk away from the tube station. The facade of the hotel is so well maintained and looks really nice as in the movies. However When you get into the hotel everything was a little dark and dingy. I checked in fairly late and was assigned a room on level 2 and was right at the end of the hotel. This means that I have a big room with a small sofa and king sized bed. The room was again very dimly lit and tired it overlooks the entrance which is rather depressing view. It took me 1 hour to set up my wifi in order to get my work done with help from the vendor. The fixtures in the room are all quite old and the bath tub just does not drain fast enough when you take a shower. Not good.
