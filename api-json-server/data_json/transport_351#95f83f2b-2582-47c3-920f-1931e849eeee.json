I did that but phone rang and rang and rang. Finally someone answered only to say hold please. After 15 minutes I hung up and called back. Finally had shuttle headed my way. Then learned that even though I was standing at the area designated where hotel shuttles pick up they picked up down stairs. Trooped back downstairs and waited for van. Took around an hour to get picked up. Then upon check in learned hotel was being upgraded and under construction. No restaurant no concierge lounge no food or drink except little cubby hole stop and go area. But on the bright side they did n\u2019t charge for it. Noise from airport construction noise did n\u2019t allow for good sleep. The staff were as kind as could be and doing tbeir best. They were definitely understaffed and were being yelled at by weary travelers myself included. After a long flight and airport hassle and waiting so long for pick up and phone not being answered I admit I was not in good mood.

Hopefully the word gets to housekeeping. The outlet above the desk did n\u2019t work and I missed that fact when I plugged in my phone the night before.

So for me a new hotel to stay in. Upon arrival in the shuttle bus driver told me that the hotel was being refurbished. And he was not wrong. I found that the hotel did not have a restaurant or bar as they were the bits being refurbished. No problem though as all will become clear. The lobby reception is area is of moderate size with some comfortable seating provided. The hotel was busy at the time of my visit there having been bad weather causing cancelled flights. I had booked an airport facing room. I requested a high level room which after a bit of playing with the computer they provided me with. I had room 807. A good view was afforded. The hotel layout is an L shape the same as the runways at the airport. The wing that I was in faced the Delta terminal. The other wing looks out towards New York. Not sure what sort of view from the rooms here as there appeared to be a lot of big trees here. The room was well appointed with the usual items a good sized bed and comfortable a sofa couch a good sized work table and chair fridge coffee making stuff and a nice TV. There are ample draws etc for unpacking if needed. The bathroom was OK. No bath but a very good shower wash basin a good selection of toiletries and the most needed item the toilet itself. So all in all the room was very good. There is internet which was very good. I was able to get some good photos of the planes. There is a shop by the reception area which sold a good selection of snakes cold drinks and coffee. This was much in demand with there being no restaurant. When I arrived it was well stocked but well later in the evening it was almost empty after the passengers from a cancelled flight arrived. The shop was not restocked until the following morning. Because there was no restaurant the hotel had provided many take away menus which meant that you could order in which I did. That worked well. For us smokers it is out the front door and round to the right for the smoking area2 benches provided for sitting. There is a shuttle bus service to from the airport which runs most of the time although if you are coming from the airport you must wait in the arrivals area which I did not. Waited along time for one to come up top where the public buses stop. The staff were friendly and helpful. So all in all the hotel is good hopefully be better once the restaurant is finished and the usual question is would I stay here again Probably. Caution.

Came here to meet my son for a trip to the city in late November. Getting to the hotel from Laguardia is a piece of cake it is that close. I chose this Mariot because of it is proximity to the airport and the reliability of the brand. It delivered on both those points. The lobby was spacious and comfortable with an open lounge area and bar where hot breakfast is served in the morning. First thing I got into the hotel I plopped down at the bar which is centrally located right in the lobby and the attendant poured me a cold draught with a smile. Boy that went down good. We made it up to the room and found our accommodations to be comfortable clean and spacious as well as satifyingly up to date. The only downside was our trip into the city at night. We had to take a bus to the number 7 train and that was a haul. If my sole intention was to use this hotel as a stopof point to get into Manhattan I would not stay in this location. that is not the hotels fault. If you need a good well serviced clean hotel at a reasonable price that is close to the airport this is it. there is a Hampton Inn across the street that may be cheaper but we got a good deal on this and it is much nicer in my opinion. The staff was knowledgeable helpful and patient with my questions about getting around town. You can not go wrong here other than the distance to the city if you need to go into Manhattan. I will stay here again.
