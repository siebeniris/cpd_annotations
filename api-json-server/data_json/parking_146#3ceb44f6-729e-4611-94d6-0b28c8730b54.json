So my family hubby teen daughter toddler 3months old baby and me decided to spend our 3 weeks holiday in the magic land and I decided to make this an opportunity to review several properties in the area so we stayed on Disney property two Hampton Inn a Best Western and a Mariot. Our last stay was the Courtyard Orlando Lake Buena Vista at Vista Centre. I have to clarify one thing this property is very good and as you will notice in my review have many positive perks but for us is definetely a not coming back kind of hotel and the reason is the package handling fee as I do not live in the US buying something online and getting it delivered to me at the hotel is something that I love very very much and look forward to. I understand that many properties charge you for handling your deliveries and of course everybody have the right of charging you whatever they fancy but at the moment I booked the room and actually while staying there this was not advertised on the website if it would have I would not stay there period not a matter of quality is just because I know there are many properties in the same price quality range that offered this so important for me service as complimentary. I checked last week and notice that now they have the fee on the very home page in bold letters so because that was about to be my recomendation I decided to rate them very good as they deserve. Even when the hotel is large and comprised by several buildings the layout is friendly and the parking very acesible and plentiful and free. You can manage your way to park near to your room which is great when you are shopping. It was the only property we were unable to get early check in because we were coming from other properties and got it in all the previous ones we were hopeful but apparently the occupancy was high that day and we got our room exactly at 3 pm. The room was very clean and spacious beds were large and comfortable and plenty of pillows which is a plus because my husband needs to sleep with many. We included a crib in our booking and a playpack was delivered and assembled just minutes after checking in. We needed a microwave God bless microwave bottle sterilizers all the other properties included but this one not we asked if they can borrow one and they delivered it to our room very fast. Our room had a very nice size balcony viewing one of the pools a small one which was good and bad good because is lovely to look at water when you wake up and have your coffee there but bad because some people used to come back from their long hot day at the parks to chill in the pool who would not and it was a little noisy but nothing unbearable though. There is at least another pool but we did not have the chance to check it. Tv service was acceptable but the wifi as other guests had mentioned before is slow teen daughter trying to snapchathuby trying to to put together his mlb fantasy line upme trying jus to check my instagram feed no no no. I can not comment about breakfast because our fare did not include it and I though the buffet price was a little too high to pay for due my daughters being very light eaters when complimentary breakfast is the huge deal for me and nobody else. Location is really good a lot of restaurants for every budget close by services such as pharmacies gas stations atm shopping and of course The Magic. This hotel has a very good ratio price quality and is decent value fo your money but as mentioned for me is a no go I bought a Jilian Michaels dvd for 7 bucks on Amazon and was so happy because it was cheaper than walmart 10 and ended up paying 12 for it so heartbreaking. I received 8 packages of very small light unexpensive items dvds a usb flash drive one of those foldables child tents that weights like 2 ounces. and all had a huge marked up on their prices due to the fee.", "offset": [1575, 1662], "date": "2015-09-20", "cpt": "0", "category": "parking"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "b658250c-77bb-4495-b3b7-023fa1da37c4", "sentence": "Very nice hotel.

We were recently here using up the last two days of a 4 day park pass to Disney. Last time we had stayed at the Holiday Inn Express although we had a reservation at this hotel but opted for the other because of the free breakfast. This time we decided to give this one a try based on what happened last time. We were informed prior to arrival that the hotel had been undergoing renovations and to forgive any inconveniences experienced during our stay. We arrived on a Thursday and checked into our room. We were put all the way in the last building of the property all the way in the back. I assumed that it was an upgrade based on the fact that we had a balcony where others did n\u2019t but am not sure now. We felt that the room was a bit dark. The room could have used more lighting. It was very dark and the lighting it did have did n\u2019t make it welcoming at all. I always judge hotels by their amenities and comfort level and I would give this hotel a 35 based on that. I would think because I am staying at a Mariot the amenities would be better. The bathroom counter was very small and lighting was horrible. If you have to put on your makeup you ca n\u2019t count on a vanity mirror which would have been nice to have to account for the poor lighting. The towels in the bathroom were rough to the touch. The bed felt lumpy and uncomfortable and pillows left much to be desired. When you are lying on the bed it was hard to see the television because its sitting right on the desk and anything in front of it gets in the way. We could tell that the tv was meant to be mounted but it had yet to be done probably because of the construction. There was very little space to store your clothes as we only had two drawers so we decided to just keep our clothes in the luggage. The one thing that really surprised us was the fact that there were no power plugs anywhere near the bed or even USB ports to plug in your phone near the bed. So charging your phone had to be on the desk. I literally unplugged the alarm clock in the power plug behind the bed to charge my phone. I also read a review from a former guest that they had issues with parking. We found the same problem. The huge construction containers take up a lot of spaces especially in the back so we found ourselves parking further away from our building because of that. Also I would recommend getting a room on the third floor If possible to avoid all the stomping from excited children and adults getting ready to go to the parks. Unfortunately you ca n\u2019t do anything about the rude ones that feel they need to speak loudly in the hallway as they are leaving for the parks with no regard for anyone else that might be trying to rest.", "offset": [2128, 2203], "date": "2019-03-05", "cpt": "1", "category": "parking"}, {"id": 11, "uid": "164fd184-01de-46cc-ae84-c82303f57fc5", "sentence": "Great Spot.

The one thing I wished the room had was a microwave but there is a community microwave in the bar area and they have extra plates cutlery napkins salt pepper sugar ketchup salad dressing coffee tea and hot cocoa.
