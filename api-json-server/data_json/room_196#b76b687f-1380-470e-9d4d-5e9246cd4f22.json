Afterwards we take a stroll to listen to street musicians who are incredibly talented maybe head into Barnes Noble for a look see and then have a drink at one of the outdoor patio restaurants. there is a cushy modern movie theater where you can also grab a nibble and a drink cocktails. and see the lastest showing.
