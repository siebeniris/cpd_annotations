My girlfriend and I stayed at the Hyat regency of Indianapolis over the weekend and I was not impressed. At check in the lady who helped us check in was not paying attention to us and did not even give us any information about our stay. Like how to get to our room or how much we were being charged for the deposit. When we arrived to the room we noticed old food crusted onto the comforter and mold in the shower. The housekeeper changed the comforter after we called and she was nice. There was also barely any water pressure when trying to shower or wash our hands. After exploring the city we came back to the hotel only to notice the doors were locked. It had a sign stating they had be locked after 10 pm but it was only 8. We then had to walk around to the other enterance walking in the street because there was construction blocking the sidewalk. We went to the pool and security was standing by the locker room door and the lady was very rude to us. We did not feel welcome at this hotel. There was a wedding going on as well there so you had to wait forever for an elevator only to be packed everytime.
