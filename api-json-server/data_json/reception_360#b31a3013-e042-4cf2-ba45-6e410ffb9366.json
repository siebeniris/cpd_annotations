On our visit to Chennai in February 2015 we stayed for 3 nights at Vivanta by Taj. As our flight from Kuala Lumpur arrived in the morning we reached hotel earlier than the check in time. The lady at the reception was very welcoming and courteous and agreed to our request for an early check in. However the room allotted to us was a disaster and my wife and I could not believe that such rooms could exist in Taj properties. The furniture was chipped there were stains on the walls and the bathroom had molds and cracks. Guessing the room could have been allotted only temporarily for early check in I inquired from the reception but the response was that we were to stay in that room only. This was not to be accepted for the price we were paying so the displeasure was conveyed very strongly with a firm request to change our room. We were advised that another room could be allotted by afternoon so we went out to visit city and came back late in the afternoon. At reception we heard another guest complaining about his room and was angrily asking to have this room changed. Dear hotel manager I have forgotten the first room number but it should be in your system so please have a look at that room for the sake of future guests. But from here the things started to get better. The new room was a total contrast to the first one. It was spacious very well decorated and exuded an old world charm. Tea and coffee making facilities were provided with good selection of teas. The bathroom was of good size very well appointed and had adequate amount of toiletries. The highlight of our stay was the taste quality and variety of food served in their restaurant. The servers were very courteous prompt and got the hot fresh food served directly from the kitchen to the table. Highly appreciated. We tried room service and the quality of food was impeccable. The pool and garden area adjacent to the restaurant is nice and very refreshing and relaxing. Each time you enter hotel you need to pass through security detectors but I guess it is a necessity for the sake of the safety of the guests. Well the start was unexpected but the end was satisfactory.", "offset": [1840, 1901], "date": "2015-08-26 00:00:00", "cpt": "0", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 3, "uid": "30330171-2962-439f-941e-d3d78c6c7cfb", "sentence": "The best place to stay in Chennai.

We were disappointed in our experience at the Conemara just not up to the usual standards of Taj service that we have experienced elsewhere. Many of the staff did not seem well trained. The welcome at check. in was simply just transactional and lacklustre and any attempt by us to create rapport was not reciprocated. We arrived early and knew we had have to wait for a room for some hours. We were told to wait in the hotel lobby. We found much more comfortable places to wait than just sitting in the lobby and in fact when we went to the coffee shop to have some tea whilst waiting we were told by the staff there that we could have complimentary tea coffee and cake. Another member of staff there said we could have comp breakfast too as we were waiting for a room which we did not do but nice to have the offer. So why did not the female who checked us in and told us to sit in the lobby offer us that or a choice of places to sit. We had been flying all night and she surely knew that we had arrived after a long journey. We were not made to feel particularly welcomeWe ate both nights in the coffee shop. The service there was very haphazard in the evenings. It was good at breakfast time but disappointing in the evening when it felt like the team then were not attentive. For example several times it was impossible to catch someones eye and we had to get out of our seats to ask them to take our order. Why do you only have face tissues in the ladies and gents toilets. no hand towels no paper towels no hand dryer machines. Tissues are useless for hand drying as they disintegrate so quickly. No one told us about the Raintre restaurant we did not know it existed until it was too late. And no one told us about the bar either. Again we found it on the 2nd evening too late. No info on these in the rooms. Altogether a poor experience whilst we stayed with you. In addition I had booked our stay from the UK over the phone to the Taj res centre as I was having a problem booking online. I was told quite clearly that the full amount would be taken from my card at the time of booking because it was your special Welcome 2020 rate. When we came to check out we were billed for the full amount. I explained what I had been told when I booked but from India had no way to check that the amount had already been charged to my card. I am sure it will be sorted out in the end but my complaint is why was I told one thing at booking and the confirmation email also said that the full amount had to be paid on booking to be then challenged in the hotel that we had not paid. It left us with a sour taste after a somewhat disappointing stay anyway and a wasted half hour whilst trying to sort it out delaying our arrival at Taj Fishermans Cove where we had a super welcome and the usual Taj service.", "offset": [1195, 1309], "date": "2020-02-12 17:47:26", "cpt": "1", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 18, "uid": "a9f262d9-4c00-4622-9e74-49f98320efa8", "sentence": "Taj was extremely kind to us.
