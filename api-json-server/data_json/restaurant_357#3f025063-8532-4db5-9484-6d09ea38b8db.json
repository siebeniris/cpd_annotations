We stayed for one week at the end of May and were very pleased overall. Our roms were very clean modern and comfortable with good views over the surrounding area which of course included the beautiful Adriatic. Pillows which are so important for a good nights rest were excellent soft and comfortable and a perfect compliment to the super king bed. The bathroom was quite nice with a walk in shower and with an adequate supply of good quality towels. The balcony was equipped with two chairs and a coffee table where full use of the tea and coffee facilities supplied was made each morning. There are refrigerators minibar in every room which are useful to store fresh milk which we purchased in the nearby Lidl store although the hotel readily supplies it on request. We were first allocated a room on the seventh floor of the east side of the hotel but midweek were awoken early one morning by a very noisy fan on the roof. This was investigated by the hotel engineer and he confirmed that it had developed a fault. As a new part was required and they were uncertain if it would be delivered that day we were offered and accepted an identical room on the second floor on the west side of the hotel. This had the added benefit of not being bathed in early morning sunlight which can be a nuisance to light sensitive sleepers like me. Breakfast provided a wide variety of choices and baskets of freshly baked bread was continuously supplied to the bread table staff keeping a watchful eye to ensure that one had no need to ask for it. The two restaurants were very good the one used for breakfast being buffet style in the evenings whilst the other was a la carte and good value for money. This brings me to the only mild complaint I have. On our final day we had a light lunch at the pool. This consisted of one salad one pizza and three glasses of white wine between the two of us followed by two pina coladas. This cost almost as much as the average we had paid all week in both the hotel and other restaurants for dinner for two which always included two courses and a bottle of good quality wine. This does smack slightly of exploitation but perhaps I am being pernicketyAl in all this is a very good hotel the staff are very helpful and I am sure that if we visit Split again this is where we will stay.", "offset": [1816, 1937], "date": "2015-06-03", "cpt": "0", "category": "restaurant"}, {"id": 3, "uid": "1dcac32b-6122-426c-b244-6ccdf63b93e2", "sentence": "Amazing.

We spent one night at the Radison Blu during a recent visit to Croatia. The hotel appears to be quite new and truly shines. The building is extremely modern and hip for lack of a better term. It is however located on the water not too close to the old town area of Split. I must note too that even though it is on the water the hotel is situated such that not all of the rooms have direct views over the water. Our view from the very large balcony was of the front entry but if you leaned over you could glimpse the water off to one side. The hotel is as stated very modern and that extends to the rooms which are filled with funky yet functional furniture very much like Ikea. The room layout however is a bit odd with the bed located in the middle with the headboard up against a freestanding closet cubicle that separates the room from the bathroom. Your feet will face the balcony. We had a triple which meant that a rolaway bed was placed at the literal foot of the main bed at a 90degre angle. Not the best layout but also not awful. The bathroom is very large and workable. The shower which is a proper shower as opposed to a tub shower combo has no door which meant that some water did get out. The walls of the bathroom on two sides too is frosted glass so if you are a stickler for privacy you may not care for the arrangement. I had not issue with it. The room does have a dedicated HVAC control but perhaps because of our visit in the spring it was not functioning at all. This meant that short of opening the sliding door to the balcony the room can get close and stuffy. Breakfast is included with your stay and the buffet was quite good.

I therefore asked him if he could top it up which he said would not be possible.

Even an Uber to the airport 25 kunas Is far cheaper than the 350 kunas you will pay for a regular taxi.", "offset": [247, 304], "date": "2017-08-26", "cpt": "4", "category": "restaurant"}, {"id": 26, "uid": "cf77f1a4-d41d-4e73-99dc-fd0ebf3ec684", "sentence": "Absolutely overrun with children and it was not even the school holidays.

Beautiful pool and amazing views from restaurant area. Extremely comfortable beds. Staff very a accommodating and a credit to the hotel. Food also was fantastic. We Split our stay between here and an apartment in the old town. Hotel is beautiful but the actual area of the hotel is not the bestand run down. Pool and rooms overlook a derelict building which is not the hotels fault however think the price should take this into account. Would not waste money on a pool view for this reason. Average of \u00a3 250 per night in summer is reasonable if the hotel was in a better location as the hotel itself is stunning so a real shame about the area. We preferred the old town location as the area is beautiful and despite just staying in apartments hundereds of restaurants and bars inside the beautiful palace walls. If pool was facing the sea for example like the restaurant and not facing the run down flats old car park would have given this 5 stars.

Concierge was also greatThere \u2019s not much around the property in terms of dining. most nights we ended up going into the old town which is about a 10 15min cab ride away.

We stayed here for 12 nights in mid September and appreciated the hotel more each day in spite of a few negatives. Pluses Position out of town close to beach so very quiet. Views of mountains. Taxis always available not got my head around Uber yet. Check you \u2019re getting a numbered city taxi coming back. We were charged anything between 50 and 100 OT kuna. 60 70 average. Pleasant walk along sea front into town 50 60 minutes to Old Town. Staff reception and waiting efficient helpful welcoming ready to answer any queries and explain. Room we had a superior room on the 5th floor very quiet balcony with side view of sea pleasant enough plenty of wardrobe and drawer space. Were surprised by the carpet but no complaints. Maybe the newer building is not carpeted. Worth inquiring. Bathroom roomy walk in shower. Nice toiletries including skin lotion and hair conditioner not always provided even in 4 hotels. No bidet though. Dressing gown and flip flop slippers provided mine broke on the 1st dayRestaurant We only ate in the Fig Leaf which has a big external terrace nicely laid out mostly shaded but for sun lovers there are tables in the sun too. Buffet breakfasts. Wonderful. Huge choice of hot and cold omelettes made to order salads fresh and cooked fruit pastries lovely bread and jams and irresistible waffles with bananas and Nutela. Naughty but very nice. Good choice of teas loose and teabags. Did n\u2019t try the coffee. A nice touch water flavoured with lemons or limes. Evening meals. Dalmatian buffet dinner very good value we ate 5 dinners. Plenty of veg a wide choice of different salads and meats or fish. Choice of mini desserts. Not refined cooking but good tasty fare. The Malvasja wine at 50 k a glass was more than in town but it was good. Tap water in Split is perfectly ok to drink better than London water. so if you do n\u2019t want fizzy ask for that rather than botledBeach. A short distance through aromatic pines with crickets singing and down steps. Access to sea via a ladder straight into deep water very clean and clear. Comfortable free loungers with umbrellas on decking area. Adjacent beach areas are pebble so our feet liked the decking. Towels supplied but a couple of times we got towels with stains so check your towel carefully. No problem exchanging them. Mistral beach restaurant. Nice crisp salads inc fresh tuna lightly seared not tinned as in most Tuna Ni\u00e7oise. The raspberry mule drink is godJust okAir con At times slightly on the warm side hovering between 215 and 23 \u00b0 and controls need explaining. Also because of positioning of the wardrobe unit the cool air only seemed to reach one side of the room. Other rooms could be different. Minuses. Our twin beds. My daughter and I tall but not overweight found them narrower and shorter than in other hotels we \u2019ve stayed in so not ultra comfortable. Piped disco music on the beach. A couple of times it almost spoiled what should have been a peaceful day on the beach. I \u2019m not sure if it was supposed to be for the benefit of guests or the young people working the bar. One day it was so loud I asked politely for it to be turned down but frankly it did n\u2019t seem to make any difference. Now for an issue that I was not happy with though this is something that could be resolved by Radison management by a clearer explanation on the booking confirmation sent to guests. On checking in instead of the procedure we \u2019ve been used to in every hotel we \u2019ve stayed in in Europe where the total stated on the booking confirmation is pre authorised we were asked for that plus 500 kuna extra per day. For 12 nights this amounted to 60 kuna roughly \u00a3 720 or \u20ac 810 depending on exchange rates. This is not a petty sum and being required to pay this without pre warning could cause problems if people have set up a holiday bank account with a spending limit for security. On the booking confirmation it stated. \u201c As a routine procedure the property may take a temporary deposit to check the card you booked with is not lost or stolen and to guarantee your booking. \u201dNowhere does it say that this will be on top of the amount payable for rom breakfast or how much it is. So I would ask the management to make this clear on the booking confirmation so that people are prepared instead of getting a nasty surprise when they check in. It left me feeling very uncomfortable not a good start to a holidayHowever we did enjoy our stay at the Radison Blu and the beach and food were a big plus.", "offset": [4086, 4190], "date": "2019-09-25", "cpt": "4", "category": "restaurant"}]}
