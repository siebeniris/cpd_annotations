Like many I stayed at the Cosmopolitan while attending a business conference in Las Vegas. The suite was huge and beautifully furnished large living area with kitchenette closets dressing area bedroom and huge bathroom with separate shower and sunken tub with huge window and view and balcony. I was on the 32nd floor in the East Tower and the only downside was the loud music and partying drifting up from the Marquee outdoor nightclub. The pools during the day are absolutely packed so you need to go down early to reserve a lounge chair. My favorite spot was the multi level Chandelier bar and of course I had to order a cosmo which they make with white cranberry juice and it was excellent. The hotel also has a lot of great restaurants right there such as Scarpeta Jaleo which I went to for lunch twice and Holsteins awesome burgers. I went to a conference event at its supper club Rose. Rabbit. Lie which also served delicious hors doeuvres and had a great live band. You could easily never leave the hotel while in Vegas as it offers lots of great dining and entertainment options without leaving the property.", "offset": [1013, 1156], "date": "2015-05-25", "cpt": "0", "category": "entertainment"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "644bb67e-e0e7-4668-b1f8-e63d36a04753", "sentence": "Balconies are sick and the rooms are huge. Big fan of the rooms but the hotel itself is oddly designed and annoying to deal with. All of the other hotels are open floor plan and have a natural setting for the casino whereas the Cosmo is narrow and just feels odd. More annoyingly though the two separate elevators are a big headache. there is an East and West Tower but in order to transfer between certain floors you have to stop on floor 14 each time. My friends and I had 3 rooms on different floors it would literally take 25 minutes to go from the lobby to stop on the 30th floor then go to floor 14 then up to the 50th floor.

Stayed here in July for a conference. The lobby entrance is impressive. It is enclosed from the glaring Vegas sun and air conditioning is piped overhead however there is no relief from the heat in the area designated for people waiting for the airport shuttle. There are two pool areas and many restaurants and shopping. There is a connected walkway to Walgrens. Tip. Walgrens has a nice selection of wine and beer. We asked for a mini fridge for our room. We had a high floor with a balcony. great sound proof in the rooms we never heard sounds from the adjoining rooms or the street. Loved the walk in shower but the deep tub was too small. Nice too look at but the square shape offered an awkward semi standing position. The only negative is the smoke in the lobby and casino. It permates the restaurants.

I spent a lot of time uming and ahing over which hotel to choose in Vegas. obviously there are a lot of good choices and hundreds of rooms available. But I was not disappointed and extremely happy with my choiceFirstly the rooms are great big and with a balcony which is something most other Vegas hotels do not have. We had a room which did not overlook the Belagio but we were not disappointed with our view. The bathroom is big with a beautiful shower and bath. From what I hear a lot of the rooms at the major hotels are starting to become a bit run down and aged. The Cosmo is very modern bright and comfortable. The pools are both fabulous. We did not find them crowded and had no problem getting a chair. But with so much to do in Vegas it was hard to find time to just sit and relaxLocation is excellent. Next door to the Belagio which is kind of the centre of the strip. Loads of good casinos and shopping malls within easy walking distance. This is something I was worried about but I was glad to be where we were. The casino at the Cosmo is not the best does not really compare the big ones such as the Belagio and Caesars but it is there if you have not had enough gambling whilst out and about exploring. The Chandelier Bar was great and we stopped off here every night on our way back in usually around 5 am so they are open lateAl in all if you are tossing up where to stay in Vegas I would highly recommend the Cosmo.", "offset": [1052, 1244], "date": "2015-10-18", "cpt": "0", "category": "entertainment"}, {"id": 5, "uid": "37286085-7fdb-4eb6-9008-f44c8153cffb", "sentence": "Great location to the strip.

Birthday Celebration in Las Vegas. I looked at several hotels and just had to try this hotel. it is a part of the Mariot hotel chains. I am a platinum member. I know usually what to expect with the Mariot Hotel. Check in was a breeze no line and upgraded to a queen beds with a terrace view. We were able to use the Autograph lounge for check in. The room was not quite ready yet so we went an ate at the Wicked Spoon. What a great choice. The food was very good plentiful and the cost was reasonable. After we ate we gamble but of course just like ALL the casinos in Vegas what money you gamble with in Vegas will stay so only take what you can afford to lose. After we got our room key and went to the room and the rooms are spacious very clean and beautifully design. We were open on the 51st floor. I have never had a room that high and I probably will not do that again. There is a microwave in the room for use. There is also a refrigerator but it is filled with costly drinks and only the bottom part of the refrigerator was available and that was the freezer. I recommend just walking across the street to CVS and buying what you need you will save quite a bit and save it for the Slots or tables. whichever you prefer. haha. LOL. either way you loose.

This was our 6th or so stay. We used to stay in a different hotel each Vegas trip until we stayed here. Now on a longer trip we may spend part of our stay at another property but always come back here for most of it. This place just feels like coming home. Check in always fairly easy. Husband also Mariot member so we can use that lounge for check in too. Now that we are platinum we had a car to and from airport. This trip we had an evening flight so we asked for and got comp late check out. We have stayed in pretty much most of the room types by now I think. Love the balconies always spend time just gazing at the city whether it is fountain view or not. The wrap around suite is just amazing. No other word for it. Love that the fridge has room for our own drinks and stuff not just filled with mini bar stuff. With the kitchen I do wish there were basic eating utensils a few plates and cutlery. Make it easier to heat up some leftovers from restaurants. This trip was room 3696. I think they call it a Terrace one bedroom. Not big or fancy but still great. Far more than your basic hotel room. Really like the pocket doors between the bedroom and sitting area since hubby gets up earlier than I do in the morning. Still my glorious view of Vegas from the balcony see photos. I love that at 3 am there is still traffic and still noise coming up from the stripno not intruding into your room once you close the slider Just an amazing city. These rooms do NOT have extra space in the fridge though there is an empty freezer. Ice bucket and nearby ice machine was just fine on this extended weekend visit. People seem to complain about getting their rooms done. We have found that housekeeping seems to start fairly early so if you are not up and out they may have come around while you were sleeping. If you find it getting later in the day and your room has not been made up call. Or you can often find them somewhere in the hall. We prefer the East Tower as it is closer to the strip. It is just so quick to take the elevator down to the 2nd floor and go across the bridge on a quick trip to Walgrens. Or anywhere else you want to go. Another benefit of the East Tower we have found is that since the floors are small housekeeping does seem to get around more efficiently. We really like the Boulevard pool though it could use more shady spots. And I wish servers started a little earlier. Had a cabana with a group of friends last year and it was amazing. Service was fantastic. STK for dinner once each trip a must Holsteins for lunch and usually an extra stop for a milkshake. Casino is above average IMO and service usually good. Drinks well above par needless to say Cosmo is excellent. Overall love this place and will always be back.

Before booking I spent about 3 months deliberating between the Cosmo and another high end luxury hotel in the City Center complex for a birthday trip. I wanted to have a luxurious experience but also wanted to feel like I was in an area that captured the stereotypical pulse of the Vegas strip. I like the lights food and nightlife and on this trip to Vegas I put a premium on having a great view. I understood the pros would come with a few potential cons less attentive service occasional smoke in the casino area and maybe longer lines for popular restaurants. That said I felt that the Cosmo fit those to a T Fast forward a few weeks and I was excited to get to the hotel. Check in We arrived early and there was a short line. My wife and I were greeted by a very helpful woman who actually came from behind the check in desk to meet us in line. My wife thought that was a nice touch as did I. We were offered an option to pay for an upgrade to a terrace suite for 60 night but declined. we had booked a one bedroom terrace room and I felt a few more sq ft were not necessary unles they were free. At the end I was wished a happy birthday. I booked directly through the hotels website and was able to add notes about my birthday and room preferences. Based on prior reviews of the property I requested a room in the East tower above floor 32. A room meeting those requirements was available so we grabbed our room keys and immediately went to the room. Overall the check in went well considering the size of the property. Casino. We loved the ultra modern decor. I classify it as urban chic and feminine in a very good way. Its evident that alot of thought went into the visual design elements of the common areas bars walls halls light fixtures. The casino typically buzzed with energy of the hip and young at heart. Mornings before 9 am were mostly dead. We loved the Chandelier Bar. Words can not do it justice. The casino did become pretty smoky in the evenings and this was on the weekend after Thanksgiving. I could only imagine what it would be like during a major event. Since we have allergies we tried to limit our time on the 1st floor to the morning and afternoons. Room. The room was the perfect size 70 sq. ft. We had a spacious sitting area with a desk couch coffee table and kitchen area microwave and sink. We loved that we were able to view the Belagio fountains from the soaking tub and bed. There were some visible signs of wear. eg wall paper and paint peeling in the bathroom occasional scuffs and scratches on the walls cigarette burn marks on furniture. Some effort should be made to remedy those issues since it takes away from the ambience the hotel goes for ie things that look nice and also is not the case at the competitor I was considering. We did get an occasional waft of smoke in the hallways and on the balcony. Service Housekeeping was attentive and the concierge were extremely helpful. Bars. We liked atmosphere of Chandelier and Bond. However the drinks were a little pricey. Gyms Pools The gyms had a wide variety of treadmills and weights. I specifically liked that there was a gym in each tower. Since it was November we did not really experience the pools. Additional Note. It does not appear that special occasions garner special treatment or complimentary gifts. Overall If you are looking for a hip and romantic experience can deal with a little smoke and do not mind paying a premium for it the Cosmopolitan is a good hotel.", "offset": [326, 428], "date": "2016-11-28", "cpt": "1", "category": "entertainment"}, {"id": 13, "uid": "af4dd61f-8887-4841-95aa-ab99ccb24d99", "sentence": "Cosmo.
