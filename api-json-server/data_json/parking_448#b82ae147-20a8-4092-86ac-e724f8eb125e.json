First and last time we will stay at a Best Western. First the good there is a restaurant onsite for breakfast which would be convenient for most but we did not visit because we decided to drive to Denys as we did not want to encounter anymore disappointments. Now the issues these rooms are not clean by any means. Dusty lampshades and lightning fixtures awful worn furniture and inadequate towels that are so hard from wash I would not even use them on a puppy. The beds were decent for max 2 nights but pillows are awful. We were on the first floor facing the parking lot and I really did not feel safe there. Bathroom was so small only 1 person can be in there at a time and the door is so close to the bed you could literally fall of the bed and hit your head or feet on something in the bathroom. do not be fool by being on the marina almost all rooms face the street or parking lot. I am also perplexed as to why there is a charge for parking when the parking lot is right behind the building of the hotel and limited so it should be an added value for guest considering there is no other selling point to this hotel. We stayed out all day and could not wait to get on our cruise to get away from this hotel.

Balconies all night and placed back in the rooms. Maybe left out to clear of bedbug and Roaches. The whole place smelled of cans of Raid bug killer. Very Unhappy with Everything at our stay.
