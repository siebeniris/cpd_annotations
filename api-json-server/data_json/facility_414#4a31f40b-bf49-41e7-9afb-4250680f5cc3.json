My husband and 2 college aged sons and I visited Punta Cana from Dec 31Jan 7 and split our time between the Excellence for 3 nights and the Hard Rock for 4 nights which we are still at as I am writing this review. For this review I am going to review just the Excellence on its own and will later write a review comparing the two places. We really enjoyed our stay at Excellence and were a little bummed we had made plans to move to the other resort. We booked two rooms in the Excellence Club and were on the 3rd floor of building 14. Our room was clean and very nice. The beds are very firm and we had to request a mattress pad be put on and extra pillows brought in. The room was well stocked with snacks and top shelf bottles as well as juices soft drinks and waters. Our building was the very last building of the Excellence Club area and I would have rather been closer to the main action so request building 6 or 7 unles you really want to walk a lot every time you want to go to the lobby and restaurants. At least we never were aware of any construction at any time of our visit as others had mentioned. We arrived at 40 on New years eve and by the time we checked in and went to the room and back to the lobby we were told that for NYE reservations were required to dinner for that night only and the only time available was at 50 or else we could wait for Oreganos to open at 930 for pizza which we did. Kind of a bummer way to start. By 70 the theater was filling up for the 1030 show so we felt compelled to grab the 4 chairs we could and just waited until the show taking turns to walk around and going to the pizza place. The Cabernet show was very good and the Excellence did a really nice job celebrating NYE with fireworks and a nice party. The resort was totally sold out so it was very crowded that night and the next day at the pool but many checked out the following day and it was much more manageable to get pool chairs and in whatever restaurant we wanted. We did not utilize the spa services but we did participate in the pool activities like bingo and texas hold em. Our sons especially liked having the the activities. We spent our evenings in the casino which in US standards really is more like a large game room with a few tables and 30 slots. While it does not sound like much we enjoyed the 5 tables as a way to break the boys in on casino gambling versus the 10 tables at Hard Rock. The thing we can not rave enough about is the intimacy of the property and the friendliness of the staff. They would remember our names after serving us one time and went out of their way to provide excellent customer service. We have not found that to be true at HR and it really did make a difference to us. They are very generous in portion sizes giving as many towels as you wanted bringing two entrees if you were torn between two. No wrist bands or towel card which we have at HR. The pool and beach are very nice and close to most rooms and restaurants. Everything is within a 15 walk from one end of the resort to the other which we are finding is not the case at the HR. I really hate to ding the Excellence a star but when going to an all inclusive beach resort eating is a big part of the trip. The food was just mediocre at best with the exception of Chez Isabele was excellent. We should have eaten there every night it is such a cut above of the others we tried. The Lobster House was flat out bad. The lobster was mushy despite all of us getting it prepared a different way. We ended up having to order room service which by the way was very good. Upon checkout the concierge interviewed us and asked what they could do to make our trip even better when we returned so we mentioned the food. He wrote down every complaint we had and said his master chef would be very interested to know and seemed genuinely concerned. I think the problem is they try to make American food but do not have the right ingredients or know how to cook the American way. Sending the chef to US for a week would be a great start to improving the output. We would have liked to had a true Dominican restaurant to sample local fare. We are torn about whether we would do the Excellence Club if we return to Excellence. We did stop by the Excellence Club every afternoon for appetizers even though they were not that great very European like and I enjoyed the private beach with the special service and huts. We are not big drinkers especially to make drinks in the room so the full bottles of top shelf just ended up getting packed to come home with us. If you get a good deal on the room with EC definitely do it. If its more than 100 more a night I had think twice for me again. do not forget that there is a mens dress code of pants and collared shirt for dinner which they do enforce. Women tend to wear summery dresses not many capris or pants noticed. Daytime just bring swimsuits and coverups we found no reason to have additional shorts tops for daytime activities. We took a stack of 2 bills and the staff really appreciated the tips for drinks and good service. Oh and the wi fi is terrible in the rooms. In the lobby and EC was great but beach pool and rooms terrible. Overall it was a great 3 days. we had go back. If they can just get their food improved its a real winner.", "offset": [1139, 1440], "date": "2015-01-04", "cpt": "0", "category": "facility"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "9fd9023a-b600-4316-add4-353e9e41a755", "sentence": "A perfect wedding trip. We stayed at Excellence Punta Cana from December 16th \u2013 23rd for our wedding. We were treated like royalty all week. The moment we arrived friendly staff members with a cool towel and a glass of champagne greeted us. Roberto head of guest services introduced himself and wanted us to be sure to tell him anything we needed to make our stay more pleasant. More than once during our stay he helped us out in a matter of minutes. Something I noticed about the lobby it smelled heavenly. Every time I turned the corner from the walkway past the restaurants into the lobby I felt like I was in another world. The other person that made our stay unbelievably perfect was our wedding coordinator Yesica. She met with us during our first full day there and we went over all the details of what we \u2019d emailed about since August. She was FABULOUS. She made suggestions when we were clueless and I could n\u2019t have even imagined how lovely everything worked out. Our flowers were beautiful and every detail of our day was perfect. Yesica even translated our marriage vows because the Judge that performed the wedding spoke in Spanish. While we were getting married staff members were putting a Just Married banner on our door sprinkling rose petals across our floor and putting arrangements of heart and swan shaped towels on our floor and bed. Honestly every little detail was better than the next. We were married in the beach gazebo and had our reception dinner at Barcelona with a wonderful meal and a beautiful wedding cake with fresh strawberry filling. The photographer from Beach Wedding Studios also did an amazing job of catching our most precious moments with our family and giving us lifetime memories that we will cherish. He knew just where to be and when and coaxed us into some great poses. Livia director of the wedding coordinators assisted my sister who lives in Indiana in arranging for a credit gift to be put on our room so that we could schedule a romantic dinner on the beach which was arranged by one of the women on the concierge team. We both had children from our first marriages and it was important that they be there for our wedding but not next door to us. Our room was 605 just a few yards from the swim up bar and they placed our 3 twenty something sons a few buildings away in building 9. That gave us all the privacy we needed for a wedding honeymoon but with the convenience of them being close enough to enjoy our daytime activities and dinners together. The bar tenders got to know them very well a special shout out goes to Hector Luis who met them on their first night there and made every night fun for them. We also remember Sandy and the men at the omelette station at the breakfast buffet in Toscana. We ate most lunches at Los Olas Beach Grill a few family dinners at The Grill and many an evening at the Martini Bar. The musicians that played there every night even had my step son join them to perform when they found out he is a performing arts major at University of Tampa. Great trip. Could n\u2019t say enough as you can see and would LOVE to go back every year.", "offset": [508, 627], "date": "2015-01-29", "cpt": "0", "category": "facility"}, {"id": 2, "uid": "26558f6c-e667-4320-8de1-03fcf193acbf", "sentence": "We love this resort. Will keep going back. This was our 2nd time going to Excellence Punta Cana. I really hope it will be an annual trip for us. The staff is awesome. Everyone is super friendly and ready to help you or serve you at any time. I would like to point out 3 staff members in particular though. Ram\u00f3n Ozuna was absolutely wonderful. I will definitely see him again when we go back. He is a fantastic employee. It was as if he was there for us and only us. After serving us a few times and finding out that our stay was almost over he asked us to come back to The Flavor Market for a special dinner. So we did and we really did not have to order anything. He served us everything we told him we really liked a few days before and then some. Even had lobster that night which is not on that restaurants menu. He is usually found at Las Olas for lunch and The Flavor Market for dinner. Another employee I will definitely see again was Hector sorry I do not know his last name. He works mainly at the bar right next to Las Olas on the beach. He served us while we were laying out on the beach all day. He just kept the drinks coming and always had a smile on his face. Never had to ask him for anything. The 3rd was the bartender Jose right in the lobby area. he is just a lot of fun to sit and hang with at the bar. Very funny guy. I also told him that my girlfriend had a lot of mosquito bites so he hooked me up with something for it. Actually turned out to be Vicks Vapor Rub. Had no idea it would work like it didthat is only 3 that really stand out. I can still see many more faces of employees there that were always super friendly and were always smiling. They all make the vacation that much better. Kendry was another bartender that was always smiling and friendly. He works at the Blue bar which is the swim up bar. The Water Fun guys are also the best. We did scuba diving last year with Franklin Alcantara. He is so awesome. I will be friends with this guy for the rest of my life. He completely remembered me from last year. Even called my name out when he first saw me at the bar even though I had my back to him he recognized my tattoo. This year he went deep sea fishing with us. If you go make sure you see him and Pierre. Pierre was the guy that signed us up for the dive last year. He also remembered us.

First and foremost Only property on a mile wide crescent of sandy beach. Quiet. On arrival front desk was very helpful with our very late check in due to cancelled flight and missed connections. Even our pre arranged and pre paid SUV transit company adjusted schedule after I called during the lay over in Miami. Good Junior Ocean View room on an upper floor as we requested. Upper floor allows for un obstructed overview of the property. Well appointed and a good layout. Shower stall had glass on the top quarter of the wall facing the window. Nice natural light which avoided the cramped stone walled closet feeling. Travel tip number 1 use the room safe for your passports at least and cash and credit cards. Remember is all inclusive except for the stores and outside vendor based activities. Next morning Oregano was the best for breakfast lunch with well labeled buffet. You knew what new item you were trying. On demand omelet excellent. Headed for the beach to find there were a reasonable number of lounges but towels were hard to find. Learned to go to the pool shack first. With no noisy neighbors the beach was very relaxing. Winds were a little high but made better waves crashing as a soothing sound. Travel tip number 2 bring plenty of sun block and use it. On the second morning it is easy to spot the new arrivals with their NASCAR sunburns all red but with sunglasses outlined on their face. If you looking for the pool table which has a nearby bar and other games ask directions. They are across from the main entrance on the left. Or go right for a very nice nature trail. Most evening meals were very good except one. The Lobster House served a very small and very very oily namesake. Typical evening resort entertainment but a better than average Michael Jackson tribute. There was always some live music within the property common areas. Piano at breakfast very nice. Travel tip number 3 pack a couple of types of mosquito repellents. Apply some before any late afternoon or evening activity especially if going to restaurant with open air seating. Carry a small pump spray version for touch ups. These suckers like to dine out as well. If you forget we found the hostess will usually have a can at the greeter podium. Again the location was wonderful. After dinner walking on the beach had a great light show of bright stars and meteor flashes. Or try sitting out on your balcony where it is easier to refresh your drink from the mini bar. Travel tip number 3. your booking of flights impacts the entire stay. Ideally you need to arrive just before 3PM when rooms are available or ask about storing your luggage until rooms are open Still allows for daylight and the evening meal. When leaving book a mid to late afternoon return flight. You can then get breakfast or perhaps lunch for last pre paid day. Consider the ravel time to airport is about thirty minutes plus the typical two hours before flight check in process. Ask resort staff to pre arrange a taxi. Airport was a little disorganized. Watch to see where the outbound paperwork is stacked as the airline rep may not give it to you. Last travel trip almost all outbound flights board on the tarmac. Yes in this 60s style of commercial flying you are bused to the plane and walk up the metal staircase. Not wheel chair friendly and a pain if you are lugging a 30 lb carry on. All in all one of the better trips we have had. Definitely the best Excellence all inclusive property we have used.", "offset": [1537, 1588], "date": "2016-01-06", "cpt": "0", "category": "facility"}, {"id": 4, "uid": "52cc0e52-5fb5-4e10-a5db-e79e4bd2a633", "sentence": "Had my wedding there.

This is our forth stay in an excellence hotel we have been to Cancun playa mujeres El Carmen and now the excellence Punta Cana. Therefore we can compare the excellence hotels among each other and to their group quality standard as well as to other 5 star hotelsThe excellence Punta Cana got renewed in 2017 and we thought it would be great to have a stay there as we loved the other excellence hotels. In addition to the makeover to the rooms and restaurants and pool the hotel now obviously has substituted parts of their staff which made our stay there pretty unpleasant from a service perspective. We are both vegetarians I have to say. The resort offers a special vegetarian menu in every restaurant even in the fish restaurants and grill. This was the biggest plus. As a vegetarian you have the full choice to choose from in theory. Unfortunately it looked like that the new staff was not very familiar with the new menu. Additionally the new staff is also not very familiar with the English language basic words that should be known as they are within their job environment were completely new to them. Whenever you placed an order or asked for something the staff really wanted to help the guests but most of the time the guests wish was lost in translation. We spend 7 nights there in total and although they asked us before every meal 21x. the same procedure. the questions room number and are you allergic to anything and we always replied yes we are vegetarians we received on every single day at least one meals with meat. As the waiters in the restaurants do not understand you most of the time we told the service manager of the hotel the issues we were facing. He service manager apologized to us and made a note in their system that we were facing service issues. Unfortunately this then made it worse now everyone tried to please us but this resulted in sometimes 4 waiters asking us if everything was all right if we are satisfied with their service. And whenever you replied something different than excelente. they did not understand. The situation above eben happened in the magna restaurant the beautiful excellence club restaurant at the beach. To avoid interaction with staff and jet more meat dishes to be served we switched to the air con only buffet restaurant kitchen table for breakfast with self service but even there is was impossible to drink a coffee and have a quiet breakfast. As our table was unstable my husband fixed it with a napkin below the table. It was impossible to eat just one breakfast bun as we counted 4 waiters trying to get the napkin of the ground while we were in the middle of eating one waiter pulled away my husbands plate in the middle of eating and another one pulled away my half emptied glass of orange juice. Someone must have told the staff that it is a no go to have a napkin on the floor. So we gave up and let them pick up the napkin and get a unstable table back. Again we felt really sorry for the staff. They really tried to help but they were just not trained properly. Further examples the bartenders at the excellence club reception were not able to open up a bottle of wine the cork always broke in the middle. And there were many more examples like this. What was also negative in comparison to other excellence hotels was that the drinks were obviously designed for Americans wanting to get drunk. They were either to sweet or full of alcohol. In both cases not what a cocktail should be like. As juices were already mixed with sugar it was impossible to get a light version of a drink cocktail. that was actually tasteful. Having either sweet or high percentage cocktails also resulted in guests being completed drunk being loud and singing football songs The pool next to the beach also received an update. Formerly the nice pool was set up with blue tiles giving the pool a sunny feeling. The new tiles are grey so the water in the pool appears in a color between green and blue. it is a matter of individual taste but the blue pool was much more appealing to us. Unfortunately the jacuzis were also not heated as the hotel manager said they were still waiting for parts of the jacuzis from outside of the DR. There were two billiard tables but no white bowl. Two tables tennis courts for 4 people but only 3 rackets cross training equipment in the fitness room needed some maintenance oil. as they were noisy. Etc etc. Nope we will definitely go there again. After we asked the service manager to set our guest record back to normal and get rid of the special attention flag in their system we were contacted by the receptionist on our last day as they wanted to give us a compensation about all of the issues we were facing. The compensation was an offer for a room upgrade in one category in exact this punta cana excellence hotel within the next two years. Room prices starting from 235 \u20ac upgrades 10\u20acWith the offer for a room upgrade for a hotel that we definitely do not want to visit again which has various room types and room prices we also had to sign that we will not raise any issues against this hotel or any other hotels from the excellence group.

Although this resort properties look amazing and claims to be updated it really is not. Looking forward to this Excellence Club experience all year to be completely disappointed. Upon arrival we were brought to our Club room in building 8. The mold hit us in the face but we played it out. We kept door open to be inundated by mosquitoes. Closing the door brought in the moldy air conditioning system back. It was not tolerable. As a Club member we thought they would relocate us. This ordeal took over 4 hours and ruined a day. They showed us 3 rooms an adjacent one in building 8 which was far worse with mold. The other 2 rooms were out of the club but only one did not have the odor. The honeymoon suite. The condition of the room was not a honeymoon suite but a larger size room. The jacuzi tub was laced with dirt and mold and appealing. When we were moved they lost sight of our trip as being in the Club. Most of the amenities were not given even though we made several attempts at the Club offices. Wasting hours being told manager out to lunch manager out to dinner and nothing accomplished even though we were relentless. I even contacted our travel agent with our experience. The grounds workers work hard and the entertainment workers also. They are told to hustle vacationers to attended the shows their jobs depended on it. It was overwhelming how any people approached us to go. We did not get what we hoped for or paid for. Every morning and not the fault of the resort washed up the ocean garbage of plastic bottles tampons oil etc. very sad to see. By day 2 of the vacation my stomach began a 5 week trip of travelers diarrhea. So be careful eating lettuce brushing teeth pool water etc. We did meet several couples who go annually to this resort they do not know what they are missing at other resorts.

Nice location with beautiful beach fairly secluded with no neighbouring resorts in either side. Lots of seating and polside palapas available. Wait staff on beach not super attentive but friendly once we did get an order in. IN general the staff were friendly. We received great bar service for our Coco Locos and Pina Coladas though Kendry at Sol Bar was excelenteFrom what I read prior to booking the resort had been updated fairly recently and it certainly appeared so while we were there. We had a junior suite swim up which was nice to be that close to the pool. We could see the ocean from our suite and it was quite close to the beach as the resort itself does not meander too far from it. The room itself was clean and modern. Well apportioned with light snacks JW Red scotch Stoli vodka and local rum available in the mini bar as well as Presidente Light beer water and Coke products. Housekeeping service was okay. A couple of times had to ask concierge for help with some requests for soda water and snacks and they missed refilling things that were clearly empty such as coffee and tea tissues. I would imagine that in comparison to most DR resorts its probably pretty good. Weather kept us out of the ocean on the most part which was a disappointment. Not sure if the time of year contributes more or the geographic location but in any event the waves were high and resort staff was cautious. We had to walk further along the beach away from the resort to calm waters and no staff blowing their whistles at us. Not being familiar with the territory and the rip tides they were warning us about while still wanting to enjoy at least some of the ocean on our trip made this the best work around for us. Food was sub par for this price point. French restaurant Chez Isabele and the steakhouse The Grill had good food though not excellent. The lobster at Lobster House was gross and service was apathetic especially at breakfast. The italian restaurant Oregano had decent food and great service our young server Joel in particular stands out. Lastly the buffet at Kitchen Table had enough selection where we could find food that was decent and the beverage servers were friendly and fairly efficient. We ate at the buffet quite a bit as it tends to be available the most. Again fairly standard for an AI in my judgment. Room service was punctual and the food was edible. I think it is relatively common for wine to be extra at these all inclusives and I was hoping to get a decent bottle for a small upcharge at the french restaurant considering what I paid for the vacation and the All Inclusive nature of it. They did have a page of decently priced wines in their wine list aprox. 20 30 USD but apparently of the 12 wines on this page absolutely zero were available. It took some loud complaints before they agreed to provide a decent bottle at the similar price point. Not something I really want to do while trying to relax on vacation. First world problems I admit but why have it there in the first place. They told me the page had been there for months. This is defintely something I suggest their food and beverage manager look into. Jose Luis Puiz are you listeningOn check in Club Excellence upgrade was offered. I was tempted by the offer of an upgraded room and I almost said yes until we realized it would not include a different room on the Club side of the resort. What the upgrade would mean is they essentially add a couple of bottles of better booze and give us access to the private beach pool and Magna restaurant while our room would remain in the opposite side of the resort. Hardly practical and I could not see justification in paying an extra 300 for a decent meal at their Club restaurant and some Johnny Walker Black instead of Red considering that the beach being at the opposite side would likely not be used because of the hassle. Caveat emptor Let the buyer beware. I guess. This vacation was not cheap by DR standards and I found it annoying that we had to be wary of anything else they were selling either at reception the tours alley the shops or the guys peddling stuff on the beach as everything was grossly overpriced. I did haggle and this is expected in the Dominican apparently and we did not really NEED anything they were offering anyway. Now there is a thought. There was a call asking about their service and I touched the surface of some of the issues we had with the resort but I do not think they are prepared to accept negative feedback nor do anything about it. This is what compelled me to write this as I feel it is quite risky to book these things and I use TA to protect myself when dropping several thousands on a trip. One excellent part about this resort were the assortment of activities. They really should be commended on that. The spa services at Mile was fantastic and worth the extra bucks to check out. The Hydrotherapy that is included in some of the packages is good try it. The activities that were not extra fees are fun too. Silent Party and Karaoke were highlights. During the day we yogad a few times in front of the ocean which was fantastic and I enjoyed the pool side poker. The bike tour on Fatbikes was good exercise although the area that we traveled through was not the most scenic and leading us to an area where locals can hawk their cheap souvenirs was tasteless in my opinion. There is very little value in the paid extras they offer here. I do not suggest agreeing to parting with any more of your money for such things. There is plenty to do without spending too much more. I strongly suggest saving your cash to tip the staff instead. They certainly seem to appreciate it and I know I felt better when I contributed to their well being instead of to a shyster trying to pawn their crap on me. This was our second trip to DR and we enjoyed the sun and relaxation of the Excellence resort. It fell short of our expectations though and we will likely select another island when planning our next vacation. I think I would recommend Paradisus Palma Real which we visited before and is at a similar price point over Excellence.

Unlike other resorts Excellence was very organized and appeared to have an efficient system for meal and drink service. The cocktail of the day inspired me to enjoy new drinks. Food was diverse and very fresh and we loved sampling some Dominican cuisine at the Kitchen lunch buffet. Every place was immaculately clean. We booked a room with our own private plunge pool but it was in the shade so we preferred to use the main pools. Unfortunately as others have mentioned the beach is stunning and wide but the surf is too rough for swimming but the surfers and wave jumpers were having fun. So that is a definite consideration. My husband and I loved long morning walks along the sprawling beach and evening walks along the little boardwalk on the resort. We also loved the nature reserve at the front of the resort with resident flamingos iguana and parrots. We also enjoyed some of the activity area that offered pingpong mini putt etc. We did not try the spa or the gym and the entertainment was fun but not rowdy. so can not comment but am sure it was in keeping with the standard of excellence espoused by this resort.

We stayed at Excellence Punta Cana EPC from Saturday Sept 14 to Sunday Sept 22. It was our first visit to EPC although we have stayed twice in Excellence Playa Mujeres EMP in Mexico. We chose EPC because some friends were also visiting at the same time. All in all this was a so so experience compared to our experiences at EPM. The following is our impression of the good and the not so good. Food. The Good Food was exceptionally good. We never had a bad meal experience in any restaurant. Meals were high quality service was excellence and wait times were minimal. In my opinion the food is superior to the meals at EPM. Excellence Club restaurant \u201c Magna \u201d had the best menu we think. Chez Isabele is second Oregano third the Grill is 4th the Spice \u201c Hibachi \u201d was unremarkable and last in our favorites. We never had a chance to eat at the others. Also Las Olas for lunch was a real treat and the food at the Sports Bar was so so but satisfying for late night snacking. The Bad Because of low occupancy blamed on the bad press for the Dominican Republic only 3 or 4 of the 9 restaurants were open on any night. And you wo n\u2019t know if the restaurant you want is open until late the night before. The Pools The Good EPC \u2019s Club area is not isolated like the one in EPM and is very large with two great pools. Plenty of chairs with umbrellas. Not so many floats. The Bad. The swim up bar usually centrally located and the focal point of activity in most resorts is tucked away behind two restaurants on a narrow and often shady stretch of the long winding pool. Was not appealing and we never went there. Did n\u2019t look like too many others found it either. The Room. The Good We stayed in an ocean view Excellence Club room with private pool. It was two upgrades from the EC suite with swim up that we booked. It cost an extra 100 per night after negotiations. We could have upgraded one level for free but really liked the room we chose 309. Spacious close to everything and yet at the end of the property and private. Would recommend Excellence Club if you have a few extra dollars. The Bad There is a bathtub in the room in front of the TV without separation or partition unlike the hot tubs at EPM. A bit odd although I recognize the romantic possibilities it just seemed out of place in the way. It was extremely humid and the room seemed damp even with the AC performing satisfactorily. We asked for and got a fan for our room a bit noisy and we put it in the bathtub. We heard that you can request a dehumidifier for your room. I would suggest it as our dirty laundry was getting rank when we packed up. Entertainment. The Good \u2013. The performers were very talented and energetic. A different performance theme every night mostly dancing while lip synching the music. But on a couple of nights the actually had singers and one night was a circus theme with a trapeze act. The shows were pretty short 45 minutes or so and started at 930. The Bad The theatre is very very poor. Chairs are uncomfortable and the cloth cushions smell moldy humidity again. They have no ceiling fans in the main center seating areas so it gets hot. The absolute worst thing about this resort and our experience is in fact the idiotic way the stage is lit I should I say not lit. Most performances are in the dark because they do not use or have effective spotlights near the stage. To make matters worse the stage set BEHIND the performers has a band of multicolored lights blinking at the audience distracting to say the least. It seems the only major spot light is about 100 feet from the stage. On circus night someone in the audience actually yelled \u201c turn on the lights \u201d and a few minutes later the lone ineffective spot light was switched on. They need a new lighting technician andor proper equipment because not everyone can see in the dark. Service Quality. The Good All service staff were most excellent especially the bartenders. Low occupancy did not seem to keep the resort from staffing up and all service was timely and friendly. The EC Concierge was very helpful and performed numerous tasks for us 247. Do n\u2019t forget to bring plenty of small bills for tips. You do n\u2019t have to tip for each drink but probably should do so routinely throughout the day and at each meal. The Bad Our room safe failed to open on two days during our stay and the technician has a difficult time getting it open once. While in EC they will stock your mini bar with the booze beer and mixers for which you ask. But they must not record it because they do n\u2019t always replenish what you want. If you are a Coke drinker beware the real Coke is in glass bottles Diet Coke Coke Light in plastic 20 oz. bottles that looks like regular Coke. Messed up a few cocktails at first. The Spa. The God We got a couples 50minute massage the second day we were there. The massage was excellent and the ladies in the spa are very skilled. The Bad \u2013 The EC Concierge \u201c gave \u201d us a special 60 spa discount good only in the first 24 hours. So we went the next morning and forgot our coupon but they still gave us 50 discount which made our couples massage 18. regular price 239. We realized later that the discount was in error and eventually the Concierge fixed it. BUT \u2026. All week long there were daily specials offered even HALF PRICE on one day. Plus they have spa missionaries wandering the pool areas negotiating discounted spa services. So we clearly were duped into thinking our \u201c discount \u201d was so special we just had to book the next day. before we had a chance to see the better offers. So beware. The property in general. The Good \u2013 Love the boardwalk that runs the entire length of the beach great for exercise. Excellent workout facilities as well. Wonderful \u201c Ecological Park \u201d with walking trails plants flowers water features lots of birds. You can feed a flamingo if you have a mind to. The Bad \u2013. The beach at the EC end was narrow and difficult to use. very soft wet sandy. Granted it was stormy while we were there and being on the Atlantic side of the island the surf was very rough. Not really a beach to use as much as one to look at from the many thatched roof covered chairs on higher ground. The restrooms by the main EC pool and Disco Club were disgusting. They smelled terrible appeared dirty because they were so old and not air conditioned. Again they were nothing compared to the beautiful restrooms at EPM that were always immaculate. In summary if we did not have Excellence Playa Mujeres to compare we might have a higher opinion of Excellence Punta Cana. But while EPM is 45 to 5 stars in our opinion we think EPC is 4 stars at best credit to the food quality and staff to make it that high. Its 20 years old without latest designs or amenities and probably needs the economy to recover so they can do some upgrades. But the people are great and if you \u2019ve never been to another Excellence resort you will probably love it. If you go to EPC you should upgrade to Club level to receive the most excellent service and have access to the best pools.", "offset": [5692, 5729], "date": "2019-09-30", "cpt": "1", "category": "facility"}, {"id": 12, "uid": "2a00e027-1c15-4a76-b017-b8c296f8817f", "sentence": "Simply amazing holiday. This was without doubt one of the best trips we have every had. From the moment we arrived at Excellence Punta Cana we enjoyed an extremely high level of service given by the excellent staff.

The room was beautiful with comfortable furniture a massive extremely comfortabe bed a gorgeous jacuzi bath and lots of amenities as well as a complimentary bottle of sparkling wine. Everything that we were expecting. and so much more. We ate at all of the restaurants and could not fault any of the food we were served it was all delicious. Our favourite was Chez Isabele where the food was perfect and so well served. We experienced sublime treatments in EPCs amazing spa and used the extremely well equipped gym. ALL of the staff at Excellence Punta Cana were incredible they could not do enough for you. They were ALWAYS friendly helpful and polite and every single member of staff that we encountered whilst staying at this amazing hotel would smile and greet us. Excellence Punta Cana can be proud of their staff as they all try so hard and are so lovely. We absolutely loved our holiday in Excellence Punta Cana and can not rate it highly enough.

My husband and I recently returned from our honeymoon at Excellence Punta Cana. We booked an ocean mountain view Club Suite and the club level honeymoon package. The resort looked beautiful as we drove up to the front entrance. We were then quickly taken to the Club Concierge where our not so great experience began. Upon check in we were discussing how we were there on our honeymoon and booked our massage and then we got to the dinner on the beach booking. They said it would be 180 and I replied no it is included with our package showing her the paper and she said it was not. We did not book and once we returned to the room I Googled the package online and called down. She then said we had to show our Marriage License which I had. I told her I would bring it right down to which she replied that would not be necessary and immediately booked it based on what we had discussed. When we arrived in our room we were not greeted by the Honeymoon banner as promised or rose petals on our bed. I had to call to have the banner placed on our door. We also never received petit fours during the turn down service. Our first night we had dinner in the Lobster House which was delicious. We spent our first full day enjoying the pools cocktails and dinner again at Magna. The next day was the White Party which was fun. On Wednesday my husband woke up super sick cramping and sick all day. He laid in bed both Wednesday and Thursday. Thursday evening I ate dinner at the French restaurant and had the scallops. Scallops are easily my favorite seafood but these tasted off and were super tough. The next day I woke up with severe stomach cramps and sickness. Needless to say we both experienced food poisoning and any time we mentioned it to the staff no one seemed to care. I will say the wait staff at the restaurants polside bars and the entertainment both at the pool and during the evening were amazing. That was the highlight of our trip.

The food is generally good the breakfast spread extensive and the room is serviced a few times a day. This is a high touch facility with many repeat visitors. The property does show some wear and tear in room and common areas though everything is still functional. Operationally surprising was that many things were run through paper records with little automation. Especially around restaurant seating and wait lists this lead to bottlenecks. We experienced an issue with restaurant wait list. In this case we were informed that there were seven couples waiting ahead of us and it would take 30 minutes to seat us. No issue there. An hour later when we went back to inquire there were still seven couples ahead of us and we were blamed for not understanding.

I booked a garden view room with the Excellence Club option. I was in building 1 on last floor. The jr suite was spacious clean and in working order. The air conditioning is easy to operate and effective. A good size balcony with 2 chairs and a table. Mini bar with beers soft drinks juices water. Slept well quiet. Being in Club Excellence we had a bottle of Gin Whiskey Rum to make our own drinks. I was surprised that there were no bracelet to wear so I wondered how they would know we were in Club Excellence. The Club has it is own pool and beach sections and one \u00e0 la carte restaurant. Indeed our section of the beach was the busiest because of amenities more comfy lounge chairs water sun block lotions beach boys setting up chairs. Everyone can go to the Club section as there are no bracelets. During our stay there were 2 restaurants closed in rotation every day so we did not get to try all of them. no problem getting a table no reservations needed. Good food with decent wine not like other resorts in DR. The service at \u00e0 la carte restaurant was impeccable. Very clean well decorated and furbished. The Kitchen Tablebufet is closed at night. Very clean good variety and nice dining room. The service was not always courteous which clashes with the rest of the staff who was always helpful. The entertainment team not really present during the day. The showcases at night were redundant dancing with different themes but the live shows before and after were most of the time really entertaining. Service at bars can be slow and quality of liquors differs from one bar to next. Espresso Coffee machines should be at every bars. I visited the gym well equipped clean functional. visited the SPA very clean smelled good and courteous staff. I did not use water sport equipment ocean too rough. The coffee shop Aroma good coffee and ice cream along with good pastries. The staff has been thought to repeat the word EXCELENTE and boy is it used. At the Club Excellence reception I asked once if they had anti acid and they said they had none for the guests to use but to go to the mini market. I went running around without finding any. Given the fact that you are being repeated that WHATEVER you need they will provide I would have expected the concierge to look into this matter for me but no help offered. But overall I strongly recommend this resort but no club excellence next time as I could go everywhere and extras are not worth it.", "offset": [1709, 1758], "date": "2019-12-24", "cpt": "1", "category": "facility"}, {"id": 18, "uid": "7e59ee61-2891-4c9d-a592-ef4950e8f377", "sentence": "Outstanding.

The gym is very well equipped for a hotel gym and the evening entertainment was superb every night. And as the whole resort was all inclusive there was no need to wear one of those annoying wristbands that are sometimes required at other all inclusive hotels. The only suggestion I could make to improve the experience would be to get a tv subscription enabling the sports bar to show Premier League football and to open the sports bar earlier so that anyone wanting to watch European sport can do so earlier in the day as the time difference means the sports bar which opens at 4 pm caters more for the American guests than the European guests.

This was our second trip to the Dominican Republic the first being approximately 12 years ago. On both occasions the stand out attributes were both the people and the relaxed format of the evening entertainment. We had a ground floor garden room that was clean modern spacious. The selection of restaurants and service were superb albeit not all of them are open every day. We had exceptional service in the main kitchen restaurant that we visited at least once a day notably Joana Rosario Roberta Vasquez and Alexis Romero. They we all super professional and took the time to help us improve our Spanish as well as making us smile. The aromas ice cream and coffee shop is also amazing and helps provide special experience. We only had one less than great experience in the Italian restaurant that appeared to be due to a shortage of menus. The layout of the entertainment area and bars enabled a relaxed experience and the drinks service in the Martini bar was faultless. The beach extends beyond the hotel at both ends to form a large bay albeit during our stay the sea conditions were unsuitable for swimming. This was well managed with lifeguards explaining the dangers despite the persistence \u2019s of some guests. The main hotel pools are excellent and provide swimming facilities for those wishing to take a dip.
