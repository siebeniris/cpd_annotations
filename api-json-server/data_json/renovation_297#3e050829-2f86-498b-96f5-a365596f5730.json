I would say that the rooms are not 5 star and the walkways through the hotel during its refurbishment is not attractive or efficient. I understand that refurbishments need to be done however when you are paying for a premium hotel you expect more.

In a city with plenty of hotels that are high end in quality and price the Mandarin Oriental ranks high in both categories. As such it \u2019s great if you \u2019re visiting on an unlimited expense account or happen to be independently wealthy neither of which we are but that \u2019s another story. We were here for 5 nights shortly after they reopened from their renovation rates varied each night from \u00a3 840 to \u00a3 1040Our room was well appointed with nice lighting a large flat screen TV plenty of hanging space and drawers for clothes and a nice bathroom with heated toilet seat heated towel rack and an overhead \u201c rain \u201d shower head. The only \u201c downside \u201d if there was one would be that it had just one window which opened onto an interior courtyard. good I suppose for avoiding street noise but not as bright as it might \u2019ve been on the outside of the hotel. This is not a place were you \u2019l get away with being anonymous. you \u2019l probably need to acknowledge at least 3 hotel staff members as you exit the place and will be greeted by 4 or more upon returning. I realize everybody \u2019s just bending over backwards to be helpful and friendly but I found their exceptionally eager greetings to be just a bit \u201c over the top \u201d. I mean sometimes I just want to walk through a lobby in peace. In terms of location it \u2019s right next to the Knightsbridge tube stop on the Picadily line which comes straight in from Heathrow Zone 6 to Zone 1 about \u00a3 610 peak or \u00a3 310 off peak if using an Oyster Card. So that \u2019s convenient other than the fact that you \u2019l likely have to haul your luggage up several flights of steps before you reach earth \u2019s surface. Harrod \u2019s is just a few blocks \u2019 walk away Harvey Nichols is another store that \u2019s right across the street. There are bus stops nearby too. Food in the French Bistro was very good a nice selection for the significant price you \u2019d expect at a hotel like this. There are a couple of pubs pretty close Paxton Head and The Gloucester. There \u2019s also a pretty good little restaurant I found called The Kitchen of London that offers a variety of takeout food which we patronized a few times burgers pastas salads and more. For groceries there \u2019s a Sainsbury \u2019s down past Harod\u2019s. As far as tourist sites go the hotel is right across the street from Hyde Park which is adjacent to Kensington Garden Palace. A walk east to Hyde Park Corner also takes you to Wellington Arch and then you \u2019re just a pleasant walk along Constitution Hill and Green Park to Buckingham Palace and more tourists with whom you can hang out. And once you \u2019re at The Buck why not keep going and stroll through St James \u2019 Park. maybe go see some more tourists at Trafalgar Square Picadily Circus Chinatown and Covent Garden.", "offset": [0, 45], "date": "2019-06-24", "cpt": "1", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 19, "uid": "bf32277b-fd29-4444-941b-56abef3c679e", "sentence": "Phenomenal. I recently stayed at the Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park London. I booked via a telephone agent and the booking process was seamless. The very moment I stepped out of the taxi I was warmly greeted by the distinctive concierge team in their amazing uniforms. My luggage was taken and the next time I was to see this was when in my room. At reception I was greeted by a very enthusiastic member of reception by the name of Vanessa who was very polite always smiled and made check in very quick and simple with that professionalism. As I was checking in mid morning I intended to leave my luggage and head into the city and return later but my room was n\u2019t quite ready. However Vanessa suggested I had some breakfast and I could check in earlier if this was convenient with myself. I enjoy a light breakfast and after a short wait my room was ready. Vanessa personally showed me to my room whilst telling me about the hotel and the refurbishment of which was very nice to hear. The room was incredible. Absolutely faultless in every possible way. The room was spacious comfortable and house keeping clearly have a perfect team as I could n\u2019t fault the condition of the cleanliness of the room. I was in the Berkeley Suite with views of Knightsbridge. The room was incredibly quiet I could n\u2019t fault the amenities within the room. I returned from a little retail therapy to a lovely complimentary bottle of chilled champagne and a box of Wiliam Curley chocolates and a beautiful bowl of fresh fruit. The room had plenty of wardrobe place available in both the main bedroom and the adjoining room to the room off the corridor to the lounge. The controls of the air conditioning and lightening were simple to use and the climate set on entering the room was perfect at 21 degrees. The main bathroom was perfect. The marble floors in both bathrooms were heated. The bath was so comfortable and the walk in shower with the powerful monsoon shower head was out of this world. The turn down service was lovely to return from dinner to see that my bed had been turned down the good night floor mat behind the bed with a set of slippers and a night time beauty sleep box by Neom containing face oil pillow mist and an eye mask. The nights sleep I can honestly say without hesitation was the best ever. Breakfast in the room is a must and tasted so fresh.
