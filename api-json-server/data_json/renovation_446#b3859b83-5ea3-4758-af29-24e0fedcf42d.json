We stayed 5 nights. Check in was quick. Hotel is in good location. Room was clean comfortable albeit a bit small for a family of 4. I noticed a few ants in the bathroom on our last night there was a small trail. I called the front desk but they were not able to access any spray as maintenance was already gone for the night. I wiped them up did not see any more after that. Breakfast was good. They have waffles eggs bacon sausage potatoes bagels fruit more. Coffee tea hot chocolate was available all day fresh baked cookies in the afternoon. It has an indoor pool which my kids loved. They do have towels at the pool but they are tiny. Bring a bathroom towel if you go swimming. Linens bedding were very clean in great condition. Beds were very comfortable but pillows were a little too soft for me so I had to use 2 to support my neck. The hotel is very quiet. Even though it was full we never heard any noise from other rooms. The only drawback was our view. We were hoping for a river view but we got a room facing the road which included a view of the liquor store next door. We requested a different room but they were booked to capacity and were unable to accommodate our request. The manager Tim did keep note of our request said if something came available he would let us know. Overall the staff was very kind courteous.
