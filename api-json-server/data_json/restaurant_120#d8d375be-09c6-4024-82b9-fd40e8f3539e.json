Coming into the hotel however feels more like a night club than a respite from travels. There is a bar restaurant downstairs which gets very crowded very loud very quickly. On some nights they also have bands playing in the hotel. When I called the front desk at 2 am one night to let them know that there was yelling outside my window they informed me that I was wrong and that it was quiet. It was not clear to me if the noise was coming from the bar or people who were leaving the bar but it was loud enough to wake me in the middle of the night. The noise also continued for quite a period of time. Overall the hotel staff were friendly though it seems shortsighted to tell a customer they are wrong at 2 am if they are calling for assistance. If you like a vibrant scene when you are traveling stay here. If you are like me and want to find calm when you are on the road between business find somewhere else.", "offset": [178, 262], "date": "2015-04-01", "cpt": "0", "category": "restaurant"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "6eca4992-d5d5-42e3-a0da-e8747f52e99c", "sentence": "No breakfast included and a Huge parade that blocked our entrance to the Hotel for over three hours.

The hotel was very hospitable and accommodating. The staff was exceptional. The room was very clean and my favorite part was the heated bathroom floor i could not get enough of that. The room was a little small but we were not there often enough for that to bother us. They did not offer coffee or tea in the room. that was a little disappointing but not life changing. there are so many wonderful restaurants in the area that grabbing some coffee in the morning was not a big deal. Due be aware that they do put an extra charge on your card that get given back to you at the end of your stay. but the website does not tell you that when booking.

So overall this hotel was exactly what we needed. Centralized right near the metro tons of restaurant options and things to do and even walk able to the white house mall area about a mile. Full disclosure we were trying to be fancy on a budget. we have done this before with other places and we usually get a small room that is close to the elevator. We just did not realize how small this room would be. There was no wall of a bathroom only a frosted glass wall with a door separating the toilet shower from the rest of the room. The AC was full blast but it was still much cooler in the hallway. We eventually got used to it once we were in the room. We also asked them several times and in the notes section of the reservation to do something cute as we were visiting for our 1 year anniversary and nobody noticed said anything or did anything. We chose this hotel as part of the Doyle Collection but it was definitely not the caliber of some of their other hotels but still niceOkay now the good. I loved the lotion shampoos. they are gingery and delicious. The bathrobes were great and the bed was SUPER comfy and huge. I might have preferred a queen bed for more floor space in a room that small but regardless it was incredibly comfy. They also provided good customer service. We went to a dinner the night before we left and were able to leave out leftovers a TON of fod I am not wasting that. with the front desk between checkout and heading home. There also was not a refrigerator in the room besides the one with the drinks stocked that you can pay for and when we called to ask about our food after dinner when we got home they literally brought a mini fridge up to us on a dolly and sort of left it in the middle of the rom a little strange but it worked. Everyone was really kind to us the doormen were great. We did not use the concierge but they did have one. The one other thing that was a little funky. My husband booked through their website and they have different deals and such. He got the summertime package or something like that and when we checked in AND checked out they did not include the perks until we asked free drink tickets and free valet parking. This was only a little frustrating because even if I am in the smallest room I do not want to feel like I walked into a fancy hotel and feel like I am price gauging I want to do that in the privacy of my own home D. Overall it was a nice stay but I think I had just as well stay at the Hilton up the street and use a Groupon. BUT if you want to be right in the middle of it all in Dupont Circle this is a very solid option.", "offset": [1490, 1801], "date": "2018-06-19", "cpt": "0", "category": "restaurant"}, {"id": 9, "uid": "2dad776a-b288-40c0-a790-725e3924a603", "sentence": "A great place to stay.
