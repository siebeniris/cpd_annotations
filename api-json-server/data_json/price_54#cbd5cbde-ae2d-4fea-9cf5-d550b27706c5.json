Flight was delayed by 8 hours we had paid to park on the property of this hotel so after our return from the airport we went to holiday inn. We asked for a half day rate to rest until our flight was to leave and were told they did not offer this. After eating an awful breakfast in their restaurant coaches we sat in the lobby and my brother in law started to doze off. We were approached by an employee telling us that we could get a half day rate for 100 or we had to leave. This was denied to us several hours earlier and we now had less than 2 hrs to wait for our flight.

I had booked a reservation for my dad due to his flight being cancelled for the day. The airline gave a coupon ticket for a room. When I called reservations they told me the price would be 162tax and they will take the discount off that price when he got there with the coupon. They ended up charging him 190. When I called I got 3 different stories. About what they price was. And then the last person told me I would be charged for a free shuttle to the airport. We went back and forth and they only thing they could say was I am sorry. This is the rate. So they liked to me so I would book with them and then pretty much said too bad that is our price. I will never book with them again. I have never in my life received this kind of service from any hotels I have ever booked with. They said someone will contact you within 24 hours.
