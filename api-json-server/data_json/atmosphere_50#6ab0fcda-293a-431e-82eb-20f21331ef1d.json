My husband and I just returned from a terrific honeymoon stay at the Savoy Hotel in South Beach and I must say this is the only hotel you should consider in South Beach. We chose the Savoy after having stayed there last year for a week. It is on the quiet side of Ocean Ave. We fell in love with the staff the amenities and the beautiful surroundings. A few weeks ago we decided to finally take a delayed honeymoon which was unfortunately during peak season. Many parts of the country were experiencing frigid temperatures as we were in Boston. As a result the only available room was a two bedroom suite much too large for our needs but we took it anyway. The reservations clerk Glacy was wonderful and suggested that I speak with Paula the reservations manager the next day to see if she could get us a smaller suite. It took Paula several days but in the end she came through with a one bedroom suite. She even surprised us with champagne. It was perfect and we truly appreciated her going the extra mile to make our honeymoon so special. The room was spacious and kept very clean. We particularly enjoyed having direct beach access and were even able to order lunch on the beach. The entire staff at the Savoy was so friendly and helpful they felt like family by the time we left. We ca n\u2019t wait to return to the Savoy.", "offset": [486, 571], "date": "2015-02-02", "cpt": "0", "category": "atmosphere"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "12d7ce7d-88da-4da9-a112-236e5df90817", "sentence": "a calm oasis yet close to the action. We stayed at the Savoy hotel for a week in May From the moment we walked in we knew we had made the right choice. The lobby is beautiful and the staff at the check in was very welcoming. Our room was facing another building so no great view this time but this did not bother us. From the early morning to late evening we were exploring Miami. The room was somewhat worn out but very clean and everything worked perfectly. Air conditioning was a bliss in this heat. There is a lot of choice for breakfast and we ate lunch dinner a couple of times. I have to say the kitchen exceeded my expectations. The food was really tasty. The pool area was very clean and the beach towels were a good touch since there was no need to use our own. Also the access directly to the beach is very handy. The location is the best possible right next to Lumus park and Ocean Drive yet in a calm side from all the buzz. Some nights were VERY noisy on the trendy places of Ocean Drive too much for us middle aged folks and we were so happy the hotel was completely calm and quiet. If you prefer a tranquil place this is a good choice for you. If you want the hottest club atmosphere in town look elsewhere. there is nothing I would change. Oh well yes one minor complaint the almost translucent toilet paper. Be sure to rip a yard of it before using it. But that is really not a problem. I would defenately stay here again. we have been home for four days now and I miss The Savoy already.", "offset": [1160, 1223], "date": "2015-05-19", "cpt": "0", "category": "atmosphere"}, {"id": 2, "uid": "9a5a33ca-b542-49c3-937c-2191ca340d69", "sentence": "Great service will recommend to everyone. The service at the front desk lobby etc were wonderful. We got free tickets to get into some bars and did not wait in line given to us by the manager I believe. The pool is good it is not really a party scene more older people lounging and some kids but it was nice nevertheless. The location was wonderful it is on ocean drive just a few blocks from the bars but far enough to be peaceful at night. Our hotel was clean and cute. We had 2 balconies which was nice with a view of the pool. Tried to get ocean view but it was already booked unfortunately. Overall I recommend it.

I do not even know where to start with how fantastic this hotel resort is. The staff are nothing but so friendly and helpful with my experience inparticularly Imer on reception did as much as he could for when me and my friend stayed to the extent of club passes and arranging limo services to collect us with 2 hour drinking periods paying a one off fee. Which in Miami will help save on drink prices as compared to England are very expensive and in some cases help with club entry also. Alexis helped us when it came to arriving back to the resort making sure we safely got back to our room. I can not explain how on board to the staff are literally will do as much as the possibly can for you to make your stay as relaxing as possible again the valet service which I would recommend as again the parking is expensive so 30dolars over night is fab as can be to the extent mainly all over south beach 10 dollars an hour. The rooms decor is lovely and the bathroom very spacious with plenty of room nice walk in shower. The only down part for my visit which is down to my travel agent we required a twin room but had a double and no view but the savoy explained they could move us but not for a couple of days due to being fully booked but with this we decides to stay for ease as once unpacked. you feel settled. The rooms do include an iron and a safe. The pool can become quite shaded early afternoon but you are literally on the beach with access from the hotel including beds and umbrellas which we used frequently just the more comfortable double beds you have to pay extra this is not included on the service charge you pay. Location is fab for all the bars literally on your doorstep and just walk up. 15min drive to downtown Miami from here also but plenty of buses if not. A walgrens liquor store round the corner if you require anything in you room. I would highly recommend this hotel really enjoyed our stay and the friendly staff we would re visit \u263a.", "offset": [107, 387], "date": "2015-11-15", "cpt": "0", "category": "atmosphere"}, {"id": 4, "uid": "ba8a7865-2884-41b7-aec4-95b3bad7a1d2", "sentence": "Impeccable.

Used the heated pool a lot and swam in the ocean. Jose M delivering drinks and food to our beach lounge chairs was the icing on the cake. We did not eat at the restaurant wish we had with our experience at local restaurants. Check out was quick and they ordered our cab and showed up on time. We had a pool view and a safe in the room. Only cons while a double sink is great it took away any remaining counter space. Shower water pressure was weak. Wish the foot board was not wider than the bed.
