I had an overall nice experience during my stay at Embassy Suites. The Staff was very nice and helpful and he rooms were very clean. I was very happy for the free shuttle service to and from the airport. Also there was free shuttle service to nearby restaurants. Lastly I like the fact that the Florida mall was only about 5 mins away by car. I have no complaints about this hotel. However the hotels infrastructure can use a little more improvement to make it even better. The mall was in close proximity to the hotel the staff was friendly and answered all questions asked and there was availability of free shuttles. there are many restaurants located nearby as well as the Orlando Florida Mall and the MCO airport. infrastructure of the hotel can be improved.", "offset": [497, 642], "date": "2017-08-18", "cpt": "0", "category": "transport"}, {"id": 7, "uid": "d043884d-410d-4a17-9c15-a8fe747143d6", "sentence": "To sum it up this was a very disappointing stay at what could be a top notch hotel. Location was nice and close to the airport. The rooms were a decent size. The central eating area was great too. Breakfast was amazing great selection and the omelet station was definitely a hit with our family group. The numbers we were given to call for the airport shuttle were not in service which made it difficult to get to the hotel. What should have taken 15 20 mins took almost 45 mins. and the hotel took no responsibility for this. Thank goodness another shuttle drive from a different hotel was will to help us out as there were 7 of us. The hotel was under construction during our visit and made it very difficult to maneuver through the lobby to get checked in as well all the noise made it hard to hear andor talk. Check in it took over 15 mins to be severed as there was an employee on the phone for the entire time and finally another employee came out to help us. It was very frustrating to find out after check in that they wanted 99 for WiFi. Considering the amount we paid for the room you would think this service would be included in the room cost. When we returned from our evening out we were informed by the lady at the front desk to make sure we get bottles of water from the the front desk for our coffee makers. It was a couple hours later when my husband went down to get the water and the new lady at the counter told us absolutely not and that we could pay for the water if we wanted it for our coffee pot.
