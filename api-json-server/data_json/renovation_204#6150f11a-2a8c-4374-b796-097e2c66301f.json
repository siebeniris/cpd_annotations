The Beijing Kempinski is sold as a 5 property and when it opened it probably was amongst the best hotels in Beijing. However this is no longer the case. The lift of the hotel says \u2018 Made in West Germany \u2019 and this really says it all. The rooms are worn some are falling apart. They have been patched up but many details are simply not acceptable for a hotel of this category. The shower head in my room was probably last cleaned a few years ago. Then there are the renovation works. My colleague was awoken at 8 in the morning on a Sunday with the sound of power tools as if they were construction workers in his room. A hotel like this should NEVER sell rooms a floor or two below major renovation works. The hotel did fix this and waived a night \u2019s room rate but it should not have happened. FB is distinctly German. Our German friends are good at making cars but cooking is not their forte. The Japanese restaurant is good but the others are mediocre at best. The staff does try to make your stay as pleasant as possible and some of the common areas are OK but they are hindered by and outdated property and systems. Check in took over 20 minutes because of system issues. I was staying for an event and the hotel provided lunch boxes for the participants which looked and tasted like they were put together by parents who want to punish their kid \u2026 All in all the Kempinski is not expensive for a 5 property but that might be because it is no longer one. The staff really tries hard but maybe wait for the refurb to be complete before booking this hotel.", "offset": [1488, 1587], "date": "2017-03-25", "cpt": "0", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 5, "uid": "b366baea-4a7b-4723-af51-fc2cd9d2fa27", "sentence": "Good. breakfast.

Staff initially informed me of the renovations 7 am to 9 pm drilling and offered to put me in a room that was somewhat more distant from the workers. Staff claimed they inspected for smoke smell then gave it to me. It had a strong odour of old smoke. They moved me to Room no2 no smoke smell. The room had non functioning air conditioning. Temperature inside the room 26 degrees temperature outside 36 degrees. I insisted a room with broken air con was as unacceptable as a room with a strong smoke odour and asked them how they thought I could accept it. Room no3 had both air con and no smoke odour. This process took 3 hours. Kudos to Mr Adrian whose aplomb and fine communication skills made a miserable experience more bearable.

Two stays so far this year at the Beijing Kempinski Lufthansa Center Hotel two days in an Executive Floor Deluxe room and four days in an. Executive Floor Junior Suite. Both rooms immaculate and room service was as expected for a 5Star hotel. I \u2019ve been coming here for almost 10 years for 2 4 separate visits each year. The hotel serves as my entry and exit portal to China partly because of their excellent limo service to and from airports and train stations that service at Beijing Capital International Airport is priceless. escort through airline checkin immigration customs and security and right up to either the gate for my flight or the Airline Lounge whatever my preference That service relieves much of the stress of navigating BCIA. I usually stay in an Executive Floor Deluxe room but sometimes receive a free \u201c upgrade \u201d to a Suite. My advice if I you are traveling alone stick with the Deluxe room which has a larger and more comfortable bed and is easier to manage four days in a suite and my stuff is scattered over two closets and multiple dressers in three rooms and the walk from bedroom to the bathroom is a long journey. GREAT SHOWERS in the Executive Floor rooms. These are designed to provide showers as a luxury hotel bath should do eg the ceiling rain head delivers a Cat 5 Hurricane torrent of water. Room Services are prompt and amenities eg shampoo hotel slippers The Executive Floor rooms and the Executive Floor Lounge of Beijing Kempinski Lufthansa Center Hotel have been undergoing major remodeling for well over 2 years during which stays requiring those spaces were not as pleasant as usual because of noise and less quality of service in the Lounge. I am happy to find that the remodeled rooms are gorgeous and designed to be highly functional. The evening \u201c Happy Hour \u201d in the Executive Floor Lounge pic from 6 to 8 pm offers a salad bar with excellent selection of veggies cheeses fruits breads two soups and four \u201c Main Courses \u201d. The main courses are prepared in the Lounge kitchen fresh by chefs and I found each and every one of them of very high quality. Each is a small snack but one can be very satisfied by ordering two or more of them. Also offered are some light desserts and snacks like spicy peanuts chips pretzels. Accompanying the food is a broad selection of very good wines sparking and still wines beers fruit juices mineral waters. Breakfast in the Executive Floor Lounge is likewise top notch with a la carte eggs pancakes et cetera and a salad fruit cheese bar. The hotel is host to multiple restaurants featuring cuisine of various counties German Chinese Japanese and my favorite is the Italian restaurant The neighborhood is safe and interesting to walk with many small shops and Embassy Row. Unfortunately the Lady \u2019s Street flea market and shopping district has been dismantled.
