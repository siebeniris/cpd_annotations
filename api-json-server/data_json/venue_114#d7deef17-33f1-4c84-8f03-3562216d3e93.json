Although we had a couple of minor issues with loose knobs handles they were fixed within 5 minutes literally. The food for our banquet was well above average. The steak was touted as the best banquet steak our folks had ever had. I agree. The steamed vegetables were cooked to perfection something you do not usually find in a large banquet environment. The outside pool was warm and enjoyable. The waterfall pool was a bit on the cool side for mature adult swimming. The kids seemed to love it. All in all. I will recommend that we use the Ramada again next time. Not that the Ramada can do anything about it but the traffic on Miracle Strip Parkway is not for the faint of heart.

We attended a reunion about 100 people and had mixed reactions. The hotel provided a hospitality room where the meeting organizers could bring our own snacks and beverages. This was a big plus and gave us a wonderful place to hang out and visit. Whenever people had a little downtime they would drop into the hospitality room and talk. The breakfast buffet was good enough but not spectacular. Selections were adequate but limited. We had a room with a parking lot view. This was a standard 1980s type motel room with nothing special. It was on the small side and had some peculiarities most notably a step down to the sidewalk at the door. I was quite sure I would forget and fall out the door but that did not happen. but I was careful. Oddly there was no place to hang a hand towel near the sink very inconvenient. And for a couple of days we could not figure out what was attached to the light switch by the door. We asked housekeeping and they told us it controlled the floor lamp but it did not. Finally we realized that the switch controlled one of the outlets in the plug but not the other. When we switched the floor lamp plug to the other outlet the light switch worked fine. We had to keep the drapes closed all the time so passers. by could not look in. Friends who had a beach view liked their balcony but were not impressed by their room. Bed was comfortable there were plenty of pillows and the hotel kindly accommodated our request for a king bed. Most of the rooms at that price point have 2 double bedsThe public areas were quite nice although the courtyard was smaller than I expected it to be from the photos. The sand is lovely white soft and deep. Note that soft and deep are not necessarily positive attributes when walking through the sand or pulling a wagon full of beach gear. We are spoiled by being able to drive on the beach. it is so easy to just pull up to our site and unload right there so this beach seemed like more trouble than we are used to. The sand was so soft and deep that my chair fell over backward leaving me on my back with feet in the air Fortunately the sand was so soft and deep that nothing was hurt but my pride and that was okay because the whole darn thing was so funny There are no restroom facilities on the beach so one must trek to the pool restrooms or drag sand into the room or use the um Gulf of Mexico.", "offset": [81, 189], "date": "2016-11-07", "cpt": "0", "category": "venue"}, {"id": 4, "uid": "c8fa2cef-28b1-4018-a2ec-69a371921259", "sentence": "Family gathering.

There was no mention whatsoever that they were remodeling the hotel. Let alone the ENTIRE hotel. 1 week before our wedding we were informed that the Ballroom we paid for was under construction that the pool was n\u2019t functional the walk way was tore up and the whole front was being \u201c remodeled \u201d. 1 week prior to our wedding. There was nothing we could do they offered upgrades and then when the day of came we did n\u2019t receive any of them. Bar Tab Upgrade Valet Parking Red Carpet Hostesses the whole nine yards. We did n\u2019t receive one thing. Bar tab was shut down after what we paid was spent due to \u201c over intoxication of 1 guest \u201d Valet showed up an hour late and parked two cars and left. They forgot to turn the air on in the ballroom and ceremony rooms we ended up using so it was HOT during our ceremony. At first the hotel seemed great we loved everything about it. By the end of it I just wanted it to be over. It was the most miserable experience dealing with those people. When I contacted JimThe GM about everything he told me everything I said was invalid.

Five star bartenders one star management facility. I recently visited The Island hotel and although I had an overall good experience thanks to the bar staff I came away with a few concerns. The specific reason I chose this property was because of the unique experiences offered by the beachfront and the grotto bars. I have a background in the service industry and have a thorough working knowledge of the way a proper bar should function. That being said nothing about these bars seemed functional for your bar staff. The bartenders however were able to mask these shortcomings with their obvious dedication hard work and amazingly positive attitudes. At one point I looked up and the only patrons at the grotto bar were young children and I thought this was quite an odd sight to see considering this was a bar. It seemed that the bartenders were constantly stuck making children \u2019s drinks and were unable to get to the adult customers who I assume would be paying twice the amount for their beverages not to mention would also know the proper value of tipping the entire livelihood of a bartender. I also noticed that there was nobody there to check on the bar staff and I personally watched the bartenders forced to leave the bar unattended in the middle of a busy rush to refill their own ice alcohol and supplies multiple times each day. I saw some people poke their heads in or walk up but leave without asking if the bartenders needed anything. I ca n\u2019t help but to assume these were managers and this to me is unacceptable considering the level of work these bartenders are putting in for them and the amount of money they are making for the property. As a boss myself I caution you guys never to take workers like this for granted. One of the days I was there a storm rolled in and despite the thunder and lightening the bartender still stayed at the bar. In a pool Of water.

I \u2019m trying to plan a destination wedding on a Tuesday the holy grail for wedding venues because they can then double their income for the week and was considering having it here. We were severely disappointed. Everyone we talked to was extremely nice but their wedding coordinator Brooke seems to not care about her job at all and everyone else seems afraid to conduct any kind of business without her. After my fianc\u00e9e had attempted to contact her with emails and calls for over 3 months we were in town to nail down a venue and decided to stop in. We found out that Brooke had left town for vacation the day before which was unfortunate. After watching the very nice woman at the front desk look in vain for any sort of information on weddings for over 10 mins we were given a card for a sales manager and Brooke \u2019s personal cell number. Calling Brooke yielded no answer but after texting we were able to get some information emailed to us. This did not include a weekday price and were told that most of those options and prices were changing due to them restructuring their packages. When asked she said she was unwilling to give us a weekday price until she was back from vacation over a week later. After this we called the sales manger. She again was very nice and even set up a tour for us a few days later. The tour was great but unfortunately given by a member of the bar staff that knew literally nothing about hosting events there and was unable to answer even basic questions about hosting weddings there. The next morning we called the sales manager back to try and get information on a weekday rate. She said she was unsure but would call us back later that day with numbers. She did not. After calling her again the following day she said she would call me back in half an hour with a number. She did not. After 3 4 hours she \u2019s called back telling us that after her and her entire office staff spending all that time searching she still was unable to figure out a weekday price for the venue. This is a basic thing how on earth can a venue over the course of 3 months not be able to quote a price for a Tuesday wedding. This is an event that would easily bring in at least 10 thousand dollars total to the hotel and they literally ca n\u2019t even quote a price. After trying for over 3 months we decided that it would be best to not even try and work with a venue that was so disorganized that one person being out of town makes giving basic pricing options impossible and having a wedding coordinator that was so entirely unresponsive and unhelpful. It \u2019s such a bummer because it \u2019s such an amazing and beautiful venue.
