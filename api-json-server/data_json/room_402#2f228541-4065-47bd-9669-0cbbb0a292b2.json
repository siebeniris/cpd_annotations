Issues resolved. I was a little disappointed this visit. I have stayed here many times and was always happy but this time I paid for an apartment and city view but was given a room with the lifts backing onto the room and the view was the building site across the road. The noise from the lifts during the night was like a jumbo jet going up and down and sledgehammers etc from the building site during the day. I requested a change after one night given we were staying for a week. We were given another room on a lower floor and told we could move again to a higher floor a couple of days later as they were fully booked. I had actually booked a couple of months ahead so I was disappointed. I was not happy to have to move and pack again so settled for that room. We were reimbursed for the charges for our breakfasts to compensate for not having what we paid for. I felt this was a satisfactory response so I was happy about the outcome. I like the convenient position of this hotel the staff helpful when we had an issue with the room. Close to transport. Close to city shopping across the road for trams and short walk to Southern Cross station.
