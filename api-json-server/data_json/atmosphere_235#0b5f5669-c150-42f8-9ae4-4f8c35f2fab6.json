The room was spacious with a beautiful balcony view of the waterfall feature and golf course. A nice large shower and tub were a treat. The Canas tennis staff were great. it is hard to mix a group of varying abilities and still make it useful and fun for everyone. The morning and evening group clinics did exactly that. The pool and beach staff were at the ready with a smile umbrellas lounge chair covers and towels. They have a hot sandy job and they do it well. The shuttle drivers were helpful and punctual taking us to the mall and beach. The Yoga classes were good the fitness center was fine the spa was very lovely and had more options than most. It is important to recognize the superior service of Carolina in the pool and lobby bars for the great drinks and service. She introduced us to a Miami Vice which was the perfect way to cool off at the pool. We ate lunch at Beach Bar Grill and both pools. All the sandwiches and burgers were fine.

So you \u2019ve been reading reviews one after another and your head is spinning if you have to read one further review. I get it I really do. I feel your pain. Well here \u2019s the thing you can stop reading after this one because you \u2019ve found the hotel you \u2019ve been looking for. We all have different opinions that \u2019s the beauty of life. We all read these reviews with scepticism \u201c yeah he \u2019s been paid to write this \u201d \u201c he \u2019s the Son of the hotel owners \u201d. \u201c he \u2019s never even been there \u201d. Let me introduce myself I \u2019m Andrew Jenings proud Father of Lucas. My Son and I have been coming here for the last seven years. Why. Based on this review and my honest words you \u2019l too be writing a review after your next stay here to tell the world why they should place their trust in you. As a single parent you want to be able to take your child children away and spend precious time together making memories that will last forever. Hotels are made of bricks and mortar glass and some even made out of straw. You can have the most amazing view of the ocean every morning but the concierge does n\u2019t know your name or perhaps recommended a restaurant that made you spend the night in the smallest room in your room. The staff forgot a drink to make your bed your food order was wrong your sun bed was n\u2019t facing the right way you had to wait an eternity to check in check out blah blah blah. This hotel is made out of love warmth positivity and a can do \u201d attitude. The Turnbery staff will treat you like you are a King a Queen and your children like Princes and Princesses. Sure you will make friends meet up realise it \u2019s not the same and swap Christmas cards for the next 25 years when away but with members of staff you will forge friendships so that when you return the following year you pick up from where you left off. Relationships are built on trust and honesty and when I tell you that you can book straight away after this review I mean you really can trust my honest opinion my friend. You can place your trust in the hands of Turnbery Isle Resort to make your vacation one to treasure forever. I could write for hours about the staff that make up the bricks and mortar of this hotel but come experience the \u2018 love \u2019 yourself and save yourself further disappointment booking a place for the sake of a view because it \u2019s keeping up with the Jones \u2019s a \u2019 sponsored review \u201d by someone putting themselves before you. Over the last seven years staff we \u2019ve been sad to see \u201c friends \u201d come and go but the ethos remains the same \u201c mia casa su casa \u201d. This current visit was more so memorable for the new crew who have fit right in and learned from the professional dedicated staff that remain loyal to the owners share the same vision. Sandy Ricardo Sabrina Ben Lisa Lucy Jeremy Joseph Mario Tam Yusef Daniel Frederick Elizabeth Fabio. These are just names to you just for now but to us these names will last with the amazing memories from this trip. Each person mentioned has made our stay special made the impossible possible made the we can not to we can Their attention to detail their professionalism and their dedication make this Miami \u2019s number 1 place to stay. The Turnbery Isle Resort is a place we call \u2018 home \u2019. If you do n\u2019t believe me that \u2019s fine I can neither force you to book here nor persuade you to change your mind. I could talk about the oversized rooms the cleanliness of the rooms the stunning food offered by world class chefs the Laguna pool and it \u2019s lazy river and the 120 foot water slide and the facilities to make children and parents a like feel at ease. Oh by the way there \u2019s a golf course tennis courts Aventura Mall across the road with the worlds top shops ready for your hard earned Dollars. So that \u2019s my review based on a place we like to call \u2018 home \u2019. Holidays vacations are easy for me. I know where I \u2019m heeding next year and in fact for the foreseeable future. I would like to finish off this review by cordially inviting adventurers to come and discover a place where fun is only limited by your imagination and that \u2019s not just for Bedtime Stories.", "offset": [814, 958], "date": "2015-08-19", "cpt": "0", "category": "atmosphere"}, {"id": 3, "uid": "cfe5b085-e8c3-41d8-899f-5fa36bad4fd3", "sentence": "AWESOME EXPERIENCE WITH THE CLEANING OF MY ROOM.

I wanted to surprise my husband for Fathers Day some place away from Miami Beach so I selected Turnbery Isle Resort in Aventura and I was not disappointed. In fact I was truly blown away by all the special features and offerings of this resort. First and foremost Turnbery Isle is a beautiful resort with two stunning golf course a newly renovated Spa a recently opened Starbucks and they are across the stress from my favorite mall Aventura Mall. Secondly the service exceeds exceptions. We arrived around noon and were greeted kindly by Stephanie from VIP Services. She personally walked us to our room and verified our brunch and dinner reservation. We had brunch for Fathers Day in Bourbon Steak a special brunch for the occasion and it was exceptional. The food offerings were great my husband particularly loved the seafood offerings. They had a balloon maker Randal for the kids and our daughters loved that. The service was equally as good and Chance the Restaurant Manager and Raul the Dining Room Captain were both gracious and attentive. Cesar was the omelets chef and he was fun and engaging not to mention he made us the best omelets with a lot of love. Their Director of Food and Beverage Brad Randal was also very attentive always checking in with us and ensuring we enjoyed the food and service. After our delicious brunch we headed to the pool were the service continued to impress us. Paola was our amazing server she was truly wonderful and really spoilt our daughters getting them ice cream and other treats. Lucas was very accommodating also and the Pool Manager Bridgete checked in with us throughout the afternoon. Turnbery has a great lazy river and walk in pool that our kids enjoyed thoroughly. Before dinner we went back to the room to change and met Judy in Housekeeping. She was wonderful and just wanted to check with us to ensure we had everything we needed. Joel their Director of Rooms was fantastic also and he gave us a very nice amenity making us feel very special. We love Bourbon Steak and were excited to enjoy some alone adult time and as always it did not disappoint. The service steaks and desserts were all perfect and the restaurant manager Rafael was engaging and attentive. We loved our dinner and can not wait to go back again soon. Overall our Fathers Day at Turnbery Isle Resort was perfect from the moment we arrived to the moment we left. I can not say enough good things and we are already planning our next trip.

My wife and I live here locally but we often go to the Turnsbery for massages and dinner. A week ago we decided to booked another couple \u2019s massages and stay for 1 night. Let \u2019s just say front desk staff were very polite and apologetically told us about the renovations and constructions going on at the hotel. Turnsbery is in a transitional phase of becoming JW Mariot. So understandably we dealt with it even though the noise level was annoying and distracting at times. Our room was nice spacious and had a great view. The only negatives were the valet parking. We usually pay about 8 or so when we come for massages or dinner but for 1 night stay we paid 35 for parking. Also at check out my wife noticed a lengthy list of fees that was n\u2019t explained or discussed when we booked on the website. However the highlight of our stay was the spa. Our therapists were GISELE LAWRENCE We have been getting massages there for years and also elsewhere. This was by far the best massage we have ever had. She squeezed and massage every muscle and pressure point that I did n\u2019t know I had. After we were done I asked my wife about her experience she concurred that it was the same for her too. We both felt really refreshed and relax after our massages. Both the female and male attendants For the locker rooms were also excellent. Even though the steam room for the male locker room was out of service he was always around to make sure I was comfortable. Overall the spa was great safe and on point.

My kids were looking forward to the Tidal Cove water park and the website stated that it will be closed until the end of March. I called for verification prior to booking and was told that the park should open during the last week of March. Upon arrival however we quickly discovered that the water park is still closed as they are behind in construction. We were also informed that some rooms in Orchid tower have electrical outlets that are n\u2019t working and that the hot water is sporadic. To make up for the inconvenience we received a room upgrade to a larger room on the 6th floor of an older building with no ocean viewsTo make matters worse the pool cabanas were nonexistent I \u2019m guessing because they are still under construction. The hotel said that they can reserve a \u201c daybed \u201d by the pool for my family on Wednesday and Thursday but it is not available on Friday. Not sure how the day bed was double booked lol but to make up for the second inconvenience 25 was added to our daily resort credit. Rooms are not cheap. For the price I expected a seamless vacation. I asked to speak to the GM John Rogers who was at a meeting yet never called back. No one was able or willing to provide me with his email so I was given his assistant \u2019s Sandra Henchy email instead who also never bothered to respond. Another supervisor called my room and offered to add daily breakfast for 2 at Cosair for the additional inconvenience. I assume I was too insignificant of a guest to receive the attention of the GM or his assistant. Overall the hotel needs to work out a few kinks. As a gold elite member I have stayed at other JW Mariots and was more impressed. That said Room Service arrived quickly and the quality of the food was excellent. Breakfast at Cosair exceeded our expectations. The spread was impressive. Cocktails at Sofs were legit. My wife and I also highly recommend the Swedish massages at the Spa. Service all around was top notch and the staff is incredibly friendly and attentive. I do not recommend the beach. A few years ago prior to JW \u2019s acquisition Turnbery Isle would shuttle its guests to the beach near the Porsche Tower. Sadly this time we were taken to a seedy beach further south which did not exemplify the JW Mariot brand. The beach was dirty and there was only one attendant who seemed overworked and catered to non hotel guests as well. Ordering food drinks was not an option. Upon reviewing my invoice at checkout I discovered that I was charged for all the items promised in the package. The front desk attendant ultimately removed them all but it was yet another inconvenience that I \u2019d prefer not to experience while on vacation. I may return in the future as my kids would love to visit the water park once operational.

I requested to speak with the front desk manager Michele. I proceeded and asked Michele if she has worked at any other hotels and heard of such policies like this. She mentioned she worked at the St Regis in Bal Harbor and W hotel is Washington. In fact she also said both hotels had this policy. I was now in complete shock. I must have been getting away with sending packages to hotels prior to arriving for years and never being charged joke. I told her I am very familiar with the St Regis in Bal Harbour and never heard of fees like this. In addition I asked Michele if she would like to call the St Regis on speaker phone to confirm this. She quickly rejected my offer and mentioned their policies likely have changed. yes I did call the St Regis myself afterwards and of course they have never charged guests for receiving packages. Furthermore during my conversation with Michele she retracted multiple other statements. I urged Michele to ensure that all guest be aware of these fees prior to staying at the hotel \u2014.

You have the choice of picking up your packages at the in house fedex office however a fee will still apply slight discount as opposed to delivery to your room.
