My husband and I have stayed here several times over the last few years. Usually it has been a positive experience until our 1223 1226 stay for the holidays. We checked in at 9 pm on 1223. The following morning before 8 am someone tried to get into our room. I responded Um we are in here. It was awfully early and I looked out the peephole to see if it was housekeeping. All I caught was a woman with long hair in a pink sweater. The housekeeping cart was no where to be seen. This troubled my husband and I Did a stranger just try to get into our room. We called the front desk to ask about housekeeping and the front desk individual told us that housekeeping was not making the rounds at that time. We explained what happened and told her we wanted a new key and new room. We went to the front desk immediately. Once to the front desk it turned out that it had been the housekeeping supervisor and she thought our room was empty because there had been a glitch in our reservations so they did not have us checked in on 1223. We gave our card again for incidentals. Fast forward to our check out date on 1226 and in their system it said we were supposed to check out on 1227 and that they would charge us for early check out. Well our reservation was through Expedia from 1223 1226 and it was all paid for so. that did not make sense. Fast forward later in the day and I see a charge on my card from the Hyat. I called several times and each time front desk said they could not do anything they could not even tell me what the charge was for. They went onto say they would need to transfer me to accounting because someone was supposed to be there. Everytime they transferred me to accounting no one answered and I got voicemail. I left a message. A front desk person on 12 said she would walk back there and someone would call me. it is now 19 and no one has called me. So I contested the charge with my credit card company. This has been ridiculous. So you will charge me but you can not tell me why. I would NOT stay here again. Poor managing. Poor customer service.
