The Good This hotel has a great location along Denver \u2019s 16th St Mall with many shops food establishments and entertainment options within walking distance or a short free ride on the mall \u2019s shuttle buses. From high end restaurants to McDonalds boutiques to 7Eleven it \u2019s all there. I spent 5 nights. I will say that the mall area is a bit \u201c seedier \u201d than it was a few years ago the last time I was here. My experience was a warm welcome and quick check in by hotel staff. My request for a tower room and a quiet location in the hall was granted. I was on the 10th floor well down the hall toward the end on a side of the building overlooking other building roofs. Street noise was not a problem at all. I had been here before and so was not phased by the two building arrangement which is easy to navigate after a couple trips back and forth between the plaza building and the tower. The bed was comfortable. The in room coffee maker featured Starbucks coffee and worked well. There was a good sized flat screen TV that worked well although it was dated and lower resolution. There was provision to plug one \u2019s computer into the TV by HDMI VGA or even SVGA with sound jacks also for the latter two connection modes. I used the HDMI and it worked. Housekeeping did a good job of keeping my room clean although shorting me a bit on bath towels one day left only one but it did n\u2019t matter to me because I was by myself. The shower and hair dryer worked fine and the bathroom though small was reasonably arranged and usable except for the toilet see below. There \u2019s a large well equipped fitness room which I used four times running on a treadmill and pushing around a good collection of free weights and many many different weight machines. The treadmills are showing their age and several were either noisy or had display and thus control problems on the screens they use. I found one that worked fine. I did not use in room dining and ate breakfast only once at the place in the lobby which becomes a breakfast buffet in the morning. It was a very nice buffet though pricey 20 before tip. I ate dinner at the adjoining Irish pub twice and had reasonably priced very good meals both times. The rest of the time I ate fast food lunches from mall establishments some granola and fruit purchased inexpensively on the mall for breakfast and had dinner in two other mall restaurants all good. I wished my room had a refrigerator. The Bad The wi fi connection in my room was horrible basically useless. When it worked it was unbearably slow a minute or two to load a simple web page. Much of the time it simply dropped the connection and did not respond at all. The connection I had was the \u201c Standard \u201d plan supposedly 3 MBs both upstream and downstream. My understanding is that it was what was included in our group \u2019s room rate. The front desk told me there would be more than one option when I went to log in but I only saw the Standard plan marked at 5 day and reduced to 0 I assumed because of our group \u2019s rate. In any case when I called the front desk to complain about the connection they transferred me to their \u201c tech support \u201d I am not sure but I believe I was then talking to someone working for the 3rd party provider of network service for the hotel. My guess was that the person was based overseas but I do not know that for sure. In any case she followed a typically annoying trouble shooting script having me reset the network adaptor on my laptop etc. Each time I performed an action on her script and reported to her what happened I had to wait 10 to 20 seconds while she looked up her next step. After nearly 30 minutes of wasted time she was unable to give me any better wi fi connection. There was also in the room a wired connection a network cable which I would have gladly used but was told by the same tech that a wired connection was \u201c not available \u201d. Why the cable in the room then. Was it some sort of cruel joke for people with ethernet ports in their laptops. Just so no techie thinks I was at fault I did not have the cable plugged in while trying to get the wi fi to work. In any case plugging in the cable produced no connection at all \u201c cable unplugged \u201d message on my network adaptor. I know my laptop was not at fault because it worked fine with the free 3 MB wi fi in the lobby and with the faster wi fi connection in our hotel meeting room paid for by our group. The connection in my room was simply unusable. I did not pursue the problem further after that first experience on the phone because I did n\u2019t need the connection that bad and I do n\u2019t believe it should be a guest responsibility to waste time troubleshooting a lame network system. It should simply work. Another major complaint is that most of the time it took 3 to 5 to 7 manipulations of the toilet handle to flush the toilet holding it down for several seconds each time. Once or twice in my 5 days there it worked on the first push of the handle but usually took me a minute or two of pushing it back and forth holding it down etc. to get it flushed. I called maintenance immediately to have it fixed the first morning. Nothing was done and nothing was said to me when I returned to my room that evening. So I called about it again the second morning. This time when I returned to my room in the evening again nothing had changed and there was a voice message on the phone telling me that maintenance said I needed to hold the handle down for \u201c two seconds \u201d and it would flush just fine. Not true. At that point I gave up and simply lived with the annoying need to spend a minute or two flushing my toilet each time. Again I feel that it is not my responsibility to nag a facility for proper solutions to problems after I \u2019ve given them two opportunities. I simply made a mental note to complain as I \u2019m doing here. I will say that at check out \u201c Laura \u201d at the front desk was quite concerned about my description of the problem with the toilet and maintenance response. Her response was to remove the single meal charge for breakfast from my bill which was a nice gesture at least. I left a detailed comment card with her noting both the wi fi and toilet problems but have yet to hear further from management about my experience or comments. With regard to our group experience there was a problem with the temperature in at least two of the meeting rooms where we taught classes all week. It was sunny and pretty warm for the first three days not totally unusual in Denver and in the afternoon sun poured in the full length floor to ceiling wall of windows in both rooms. There were blackout drapes but they did prevent the temperature from rising up toward 80 in those rooms in the afternoon. Maintenance was called and we were told that the HVAC system for those rooms covered too wide an area for them to lower the temperature effectively and quickly for us. We put up with our class members fanning themselves getting drowsy and sweating through those afternoons. It got cloudy and cooler the last two days so the problem lessened then. Perhaps the maintenance problems have something to do with the fact that a large sign declaring a labor dispute with Starwod Hotels was being displayed every day on the sidewalk outside the hotel. I searched on line but could not find any information about the dispute and its concerns. My other smaller gripe which may just be a matter of taste is that I did not like the guest room furniture which consisted of a large high surface holding the TV and coffee maker with a very small low chest of drawers and an oval shaped desk slid beneath. I felt the drawer space was limited for my 5 days there and annoying for an old guy to bend over so far to reach even the top drawer. I did not care for the oval desk as a work space. To use the coffee maker I had to reach over the desk where my laptop would normally rest with obvious concerns about spillage etc. The bedside stands were also that odd oval shape with no drawers available there either. An old cabinet for a mini bar was stuck in the closet and a couple of bottled waters and the ice bucket sat on top of it in the closet. an odd arrangement that very much reduced floor space in the closet and would have interfered with hanging up any long garment. The upshot is that this place has a great downtown location and fairly comfortable rooms but if you need wi fi in your room I would avoid it and I would be prepared to deal with unresponsive unhelpful maintenance both in regard to guest rooms and meeting rooms.", "offset": [8288, 8549], "date": "2015-01-31", "cpt": "0", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 2, "uid": "c38c6e81-0a62-4d60-8c18-9d98f2b3f8e4", "sentence": "Rooms are rough around the edges. I come with mixed wisdom. This is a large sprawling hotel complex which can be incredibly hard to navigate initially. With two separate hotel buildings connected through an underground conference center and multiple elevators going to different places you will surely be a bit confused upon arrival. But the good. The dining selection is incredible. Multiple restaurants within the complex to cater to just about any desire. If you are here for work it does not get better. A lot of places to really never have to leave the hotel unles you want to. Also the gym is one of the best hotel gyms I have ever stepped foot in. it is larger than some commercial gyms I have been to. A full circuit machine spread plus about 10 treadmills and the same amount of elipticals make for a great workout space. But on to the less desirable. The rooms suck. I stayed in the tower and even being on the starwod preferred floor the rooms are tiny for starters. They are recently ish renovated for the most part but many New York City hotel rooms are larger than what mine was. Beyond size a lot of edges are just rough. The bathtub faucet dripped constantly and the drain made gargling noises the entire stay. The toilet was super old school with a flusher built into the wall so that it really took some manipulation to flush it. The windows. let us talk about the windows. Yes it is true Denver gets 350 days of sun or whatever. that is amazing. But having windows that are barely insulated is not lovely. Each morning we had wake up with curtains closed to dripping sweat as the sun penetrated the windows so effortlessly that it was unavoidable. Even with the AC on the coldest and highest settings the entire time our room was consistently unbearable.

The location of the Sheraton is great right next to the 15th street mall which is really an outdoor shopping entertainment area with tons of shops and restaurants within walking distance. The hotel itself though was just OK. My room on the 20th floor was actually very spacious and had a nice view of the city. Probably one of the biggest standard hotel rooms I have stayed in with a walk in closet in the foyer huge bedroom dressing area and very large bathroom. The room was orientated facing outwards so that whole front wall instead of just a side was actually windows. However everything felt a bit dated. The decor was all dark brown and neutrals old carpet noisy HVAC system that I had to run off in order to sleep. In fact in some ways I had the feeling that I was staying in a converted office building. The club room on the 22nd floor is nice great views several places to sit. Breakfast served until 9 am very picked over by 845am though. there is a reception in the evening with some complimentary appetizers you could really make this into a meal if you wanted to and wine drinks for purchase. Any other time of the day you can go in and get complimentary waters and sodas. It would have been nice if the drinks were available later on in the evening as well or if the room had a stocked minibar. I would have liked a glass of wine. but since I did not feel like going to a bar restaurant my only option would be to order on the room service menu. The room service menu is actually all digital on the TV. Well it did not work on the first two attempts even after I called the front desk. We eventually got it to work but after that I did not even feel like ordering anymore. Nice idea to have everything on the TV but an old fashioned menu printed out would have been preferable. The hotel itself is also very large and spread across two separate building connected by a pedestrian bridge over the street. So convenience may depend on which building your room is in. The year round outdoor pool is actually not quite year round. It was closed when I visited on a rainy sleety day in April. However I am sure it is quite nice in the summer. No hot tub which was disappointing. Overall it was perfectly fine.
