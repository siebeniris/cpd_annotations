What a disaster from start to finish. My husband and I had booked a much long awaited trip on the Northern Belle train which was leaving Manchester Picadily so as I knew we had be having a few glasses of bubbly decided to book an overnight trip in Manchester and take in the Christmas Markets. I emailed the hotel asking if we could maybe book in early 1ish as the train was leaving at 12 and we wanted to refresh before we left. I was told the earliest Check In was 3 pm but we could leave our bags in Reception. As we had paid \u00a3 50 for our train trip we did nt want to be leaving in a hurry so booked a room for the night before so we could get a good nights sleep and feel refreshed for our trip. Well this is where it went drastically downhilWe arrived at 9 pm and was checked in and immediately quoted the wrong price for our 2 night stay. When I queried this I was told there was A note with 2 different prices so I thought I better charge the higher price We were then shown to our room which was on the 14th floor. The key did not work this happened for the whole two disastrous days we had the misfortune to stay here. The room seemed clean and had a coffee machine as advertised I was pleased about this as I like a good coffee to kick start my day. We tried to sleep but were struggling with the noise from the air conditioning1am. My husband phoned reception and they suggested we try turning it off which we did2am. Still no sleep so rang reception again who suggested maybe the noise was from the neighbours air con and it should settle down3am. Close to tears rang reception who said they would send someone up4am. Still no sleep maintenance arrived and agreed the air con was ridiculously loud and suggest we move roms430 We moved rooms in our pjs and managed to grab an hours sleep. So much for feeling refreshed on our trip we were like the walking deadWent to make a coffee only to realise the room we had been moved to did not have a coffee machine. TypicalAfter a long day on the Northern Belle Which was marvellous. my husband and I were too tired from lack of sleep the previous evening so decided to skip the Christmas markets and try and rest. Same old thing key not working when we got to our room when we eventually did get in we found the room had not been cleaned yet someone had clearly been in there as there was an open tin of Iron Brew left on the side. BizareThe icing on the cake was when we checked out I looked at the Invoice to see I had been overcharged. I complained to the manager Francisco Escalante who made all the right noises and offered me a room at any Radison with a free breakfast and an upgrade to a suite. As the rooms are roughly \u00a3 184 a night I welcomed this offer as compensation for a disastrous stay at Radison Edwardian. However I found this was just empty promises as whenever I tried to take him up on his gesture I was met with excuses.

My wife and I returned recently from spending 5 nights towards the end of March 2019 at the Radison Blu Edwardian in Peter Street Manchester. This has been our favourite hotel in Manchester city centre over the last decade. Prior to our arrival we had been in eager anticipation this time to see for ourselves the results of a fairly major renovation of the ground floor area over the winter months though the changes were not quite as radical as we had been led to believe on our previous visit in 2018As on previous visits we were given a warm and friendly welcome on arrival this time by Katie at the remodeled reception desk. It does make a huge difference when guests are made to feel \u2018 at home \u2019 which is the case at this lovely hotel which is not as impersonal as other large hotels at which we have stayed in the UK and farther afield. Here all members of staff seem to understand the importance of engaging with the guests and giving them excellent service. On this visit the recently appointed Guest Relations Manager Barnaby Pazio introduced himself to us. He was absolutely first class in making us feel welcome and in sorting out any little problems we encountered. For example we had a problem with one of our wardrobe doors and advised him of it when we went out one morning. When we returned a few hours later it had been fixed. Now that is as it should be. We also had the pleasure of meeting Lindsey from the Hotel Conferences section at a complimentary drinks reception early one evening and she too was very pleasant and welcoming. Both of these are great additions to the Radison staff in Peter Street. We had booked a de luxe \u2018 easy access \u2019 room because my wife has a slight disability and is partially sighted. We were allocated room 120 which had both a walk in shower and a bath. The modern bedrooms in this hotel especially the bathrooms are very cleverly designed and have everything a guest could reasonably require. The king sized bed was firm but extremely comfortable and we slept well with no outside noise to disturb us. There was a table and two chairs a room safe and a refreshments tray replenished each day. A trouser press and an ironing board were in the room \u2013 I find the trouser press particularly useful. The free hotel Wifi for guests was fast and reliable. We always request a room with views over the city skyline and this means we can see the Town Hall clock illuminated throughout the night. We can imagine that it must have been rather disturbing in the hotel during the Winter renovations but we experienced absolutely no noise at any time during our stay. The breakfasts which are now served in the Peter Street Kitchen are good but not quite as good as they were on previous visits. The choices are replenished regularly and there are a few hot choices from an A la Carte menu which are specially prepared. I like to select the poached eggs on toast some mornings rather than a \u2018 Full English \u2019. At the risk of repeating myself we do not favour what seems to be a newish policy for Radison in only offering what might be termed \u2018 healthy options \u2019. For example the only milk on offer at the buffet was Soya Almond or skimmed and there were no corn flakes \u2013. probably Britain \u2019s most popular cereal choice. It \u2019s as if there is suddenly a world shortage of Corn Flakes because we encountered this at a Liverpool Hotel in January 2019 but in that case the popular cereal was supplied from the kitchen on request. We had a charming Greek waitress who very kindly brought us semi shimed milk from the kitchen when we requested it. We did find it rather contradictory that there was only butter on offer but no low fat spreadWhat used to be the Opus One Restaurant has gone now and been replaced by the re styled and renamed \u2018 Peter Street Kitchen \u2019 serving Mexican and Asian food. Frankly we are not experienced in that type of cuisine so were most grateful to the lead waiter who patiently talked us through the menu and guided us in our choices. We decided in the end to try the Chef \u2019s tasting menu and enjoyed it very much. It was not too spicy and we felt this meal was a big improvement on our poor experiences in the previous restaurant the old Opus One. The meal cost was \u00a3 218 for two including an optional 10 service chargeThe bar staff are very good and obliging. Indeed one of the mixologists we were told was top of his game in the Manchester area. We both thought the alcoholic drinks were very expensive. I had a single 50 ml Brandy one evening and was charged \u00a3 180On this visit we decided to try the Afternoon Tea which was also served in the Peter Street Kitchen. It was pretty busy. The staff were very pleasant and we found it to be a rather relaxing experience. Unfortunately the service was disappointing. We had booked well in advance but had to wait a while after we were shown to our table before anyone approached to serve us and we had to wave to a member of staff to order a couple of cocktails. The Spa in the basement area has been renovated too. Whilst we went down in the lift to look through the window at the pool area we did n\u2019t try any of the treatments. The new \u2018 Library \u2019 room on the ground floor was due to open in April 2019 as the work was not quite finished. We were advised that this new room will offer a relaxed environment with books to read where snacks and drinks will be available. This will prove a useful addition as the only eating option at the time of our visit was the main restaurant. The location of the hotel is ideal for theatres conference centres local restaurants and is not far from St Anne \u2019s Square and the main shopping district. One of the best features at this Radison Blu Edwardian is the extremely high standard of the excellent Concierge service. Chief Concierge Gary and his first rate team are so helpful and they seem to know the answer to every conceivable question offering helpful advice throughout our stay as usual. Nothing is too much trouble to this team whose knowledge and ability to second guess what guests need always impresses usWe are looking forward to our next visit to this fine hotel already.", "offset": [268, 673], "date": "2019-04-15", "cpt": "2", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 22, "uid": "4bb4a8d7-5ca4-4b9d-b766-5aa6cb2694b4", "sentence": "Fine Hotel tough weekend.

Hairdryer clean puffy towels and a good amount of storage and space in each room makes for comfort away from home. The hotel room service is excellent. The food tastes fresh and is well presented.

I will add that most hotels charge crazy money for the bar fridge contents and while Radison is n\u2019t cheap it \u2019s nowhere near as overpriced on the fridge as I \u2019ve seen. I still will venture to the nearby Tesco and Sainsbury 5 mins walk. There is a plethora of food and sights to see nearby. Street noise can not be heard once inside the hotel and certainly not in your room. There is food of all sorts within a 3 5 minute walk and really good food too not just cheap and cheerful.

We used the spa which again had been recently refurbished and it really does not take long for you to feel relaxed. The staff welcoming and informative. The new fitness area had a few people in but we will be bringing our trainers to give it a whirl next time. The pool area had comfy lounge seating a great whirlpool steam and sauna but it is newest addition was a shower where you could choose a setting from waterfall Caribbean storm cool mist and normal. We had fun playing with thisWe had a drink in the bar which has a Japanese and Mexican theme. The staff again treated us well and the range f drinks is interesting. Japanese beers and cocktails with and Asian twist. Although it is a 5 star hotel the prices are pretty similar to any other Manchester City Centre bar but the clientele a little more refinedAfter a comfortable nights sleep we went down for breakfast. It was delicious and we did not have to wait to be served. Coffee came promptly and extra order of eggs and the selection to choose from was great. The food was well cooked and tasted good. We got chatting to some of the staff who were very cheery and happy to talk to us. The fact that we used Tesco Clubcard vouchers for our stay and only had to pay taxes on our stay was an added bonusA really great stay and we will be back.", "offset": [323, 399], "date": "2020-01-14", "cpt": "3", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 31, "uid": "dc807e1d-c64a-4d3a-955e-7cc3aac49945", "sentence": "Just Passing. My wife and I are both Mancunians and have lived in Manchester for over sixty years. A couple of days ago we were passing the Edwardian hotel and stopped to admire the building which we remembered as the Manchester Free Trade Hall and the venue of many historical occasions and Bob Dylans infamous electric gig. We were kindly invited in by the porter who is name was Mark and given a brief tour of the building and facilities. I would like to extend my thanks to Mark for the tour and say that the internal decor and renovation does justice to this magnificent building.

Me and my partner stopped here for two nights and stayed in a premium city view room. The hotel is in a central location close to bars and a short walk from Oxford Road Station and a bit further to Picadily. We found the staff curtious and helpful and the hotel to be very nice and posh. We had a couple of issues in the room the first being the electric blinds were at different heights so when one closed the other still had some way to go causing damage to the lower blind. We contacted the customer services who said they would send someone but none arrived meaning I had to go to reception and ask again. When the maintenance guy did arrive he said he would come back when we were out that night but he never did again I had to ask at reception for a 5 star hotel I would not expect to have to ask for a fault to be resolved as many times as I did. In the end the problem was solved the next day. We also had a mark on the duvet cover which we left a note for the cleaner to change and they did. We made use of the spa facilities which are very nice and also had a drink in the bar which was also lovely. You get \u00a3 15 per night complimentary credit on the city view rooms to spend in the bar or restaurant which is also a nice gesture.", "offset": [645, 888], "date": "2020-01-27", "cpt": "3", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 33, "uid": "c258a3bf-790d-4013-bee8-2e7aaeada49f", "sentence": "Exceptional. Freshly refurbished super smart appearance and comfortable rooms and good value price wise on the night I stayed very impressed.

The new spa gym is excellent and their new treatment list looks wonderful. All the staff are very helpful and can not do enough. Especially mike the doorman who was very helpful. The drains in the bathroom smelt really bad. The house keepers tried their best to get ridof the smell however the lemon cleaning product soon wore off. Then you had find yourself laying in bed with sewage aroma in the air. The bathroom is very tired looking with cracked tiles and the basic bath having lots of imperfections. Really let us down the hotel refurb. Lots of shouting and doors slamming at 4 am. Struggled to have a good nights sleep the pillows were too soft but they did bring us some firmer pillows. Normally sleep well in this hotel do not know if they have ditched the virtue mattresses they used to have or if it was just me.", "offset": [512, 548], "date": "2020-02-15", "cpt": "3", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 35, "uid": "7cd266ac-710c-4800-8253-e28a04ed86ca", "sentence": "Had a fantastic experience.
