It is really rare to have outstanding rooms and equally great service in one location. The customers get this at Hilton Orlando Altamonte Springs. I will make this my place of stay each and every time that I am in Orlando or traveling across Central Florida to another location and must stay nearby overnight.

Caled ahead two weeks in advance for hypoalergenic bedding this property uses down feathers. Room bed was not hypoalergenic upon arrival.

We were promised access to the Executive Lounge to store serve food for our large party. There is a sign outside the Executive Lounge that says Open 24 Hours except it is not. Apparently it is closed on the weekend. when the hotel is it is busiest. We had catered food brought to hotel for sole purpose of serving in the Executive Lounge which the staff refused to accommodate us on after telling us it would be made available to us. Bottom line do not stay here. do not hold your event here. The staff could care less about it is guests. Long version Checked in the day before on the ap and was told I would have room 740 which is on the Executive Floor. Checked in and was given room 640. did not seem to matter that I was a H member. Most of the people in our group were booked on the 7th and 8th Floors which you can not access in the elevator without a room key so it made it close to impossible to visit other rooms family members. After checking in I requested a digital access key on the ap the ability to use your phone as a key and it said I had a digital key for room 740. not 640I had called ahead two weeks prior and requested hypoalergenic bedding which I was told would be on the bed upon arrival. It was not. I made three phone calls to the Front Desk over a six hour period and it was not till the third call that someone from housekeeping finally showed up. The pillows and comforter are down feathers. The following debacle then ensued1st visit Housekeeping brings me two hypo pillows. I inform them that the comforter still needs to be changed and that the other two pillows also need to be hypo. 2nd visit Someone shows up with sheets. Informed them we did not need sheets we needed two hypo pillows and a comforter3rd visit Someone shows up with a comforter. No pillows. Puts comforter on bed. Wrong size. Told her not to worry about it but still needed pilows4th visit Waited 30 40 mins for pillows when they did not arrive I left the room. When I returned half an hour later they had been put on bed. As previously mentioned our group held an event at the hotel on Sunday night we had arranged for use of the executive lounge on Friday and Saturday night as a gathering meal place for our group. After arriving with two pallets of food we were told that the lounge is closed on the weekend and they refused to accommodate us. There was a serious power struggle going on between the general manager of the hotel and a leader from our group. We then proceed to wheel around two pallets of food on a hotel cart for the next two hours from floor to floor while misinformation was fed to us as to where we should place the food. In the end no one ended up eating and someone picked it up and took it back to their house. I do not believe the customer is always right but the customer should be accommodated to the best of the hotels ability.
