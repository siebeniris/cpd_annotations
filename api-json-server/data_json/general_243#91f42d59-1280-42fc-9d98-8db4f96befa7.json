We took our first family vacation with all three kids 5 3 and 1 and stayed at this property. I travel a lot for work so I am typically a pretty good judge of hotels when booking them. This one appeared to be a great hotel for families so we upgraded to a Family Suite and paid more to do so with a Marina or Pool view so my wife and I could enjoy the balcony and view while the kids were napping. asleep. The overall property is decent but it caters more to corporations as they had several conferences going on. They do have a couple of small water slides a shallow end of one pool for little kids and a few games but it is better suited for businesses conferences. Unfortunately our experience was not a good one mainly due to our Family Suite. Family Suite This was the most disappointing part of the hotel by far. Again we upgraded paid more to a Family Suite that advertised a Marina or Pool view so our expectations were high. The Family Suites are on the 2nd floor of the Tower. Once we entered our suite we immediately realized it overlooked a roof that covered the service docks and we only had a very slight view of the marina through the dense trees see attached picture. The service dock is where the industrial trash compactor laundry carts and laundry trucks reside. I called the front desk to express our disappointment with the suite and the view and was told they do not guarantee the view. yet they market it with a Marina or Pool view. How can you say you do not guarantee a view when they market that on their site. The girl at the front desk told us they could not move us to a different suite. The Family Suite was not very conducive to kids. It appears it is one of their standard suites that they simply removed the couch from the living room area and replaced it with a bunk bed. The big conference table was still in that room so it appears they move the bunk beds in and out when someone books a Family Suite. Otherwise it is a regular suite by putting the couch back in. The issues with the room continued. The industrial trash compactor in the service dock woke all of us up every morning starting as early as 430am. Then we had hear the laundry carts laundry trucks people talking etc. after that. We were also right next to the elevator bay which we requested not to be next to would hear some kind of drilling sound each day not sure if it was a service room near us and to top it off they have meeting party rooms below us on first floor that had extremely loud music from a corporate event. Even one of our kids came in the room saying she could not sleep with that loud music. We had to call the front desk three times to get them to turn down the music. Then those people went out onto the patio which was directly below our room as well. Why would anyone put Family Suites directly above the party rooms. We also did not have any hot water in the bathroom sink and called to have it repaired. Nobody ever came to fix it so we had cold water all week. Also the shower head would not turn off when we were filling the tub for the kids. I did speak to the manager halfway through our stay and he offered to move us after the front desk girl told us they could not. but by that time we only had two nights left and it would have been a large undertaking to move all of our stuff. We also spoke to another family that had similar issues and they chose to move but they ended up having to wait for quite a while to get into the new room and we did not want to go through that with three small kids. The manager did credit us a few items but it was nowhere near what it should have been and we continued to experience disruptions noise after that every single night morning. I left a message for the manager the day we arrived back home he still has not called me back. Here were a few more issues we encountered and things to be aware of. Luggage Cart Upon arrival we saw a luggage cart in the lobby and went to grab it. The bell hop asked what we were doing and we told him we were going to use it to put our luggage on it and wheel it up to the front desk. He told us they do not let guests use it and it is only for hotel staff. We had already hauled the kids and luggage through two airports and two shuttle buses so getting luggage from the vehicle to the front desk was not that big of a deal but come on. you can not let us use it from our car to the front deskCheck in I was at the counter to check in and was told they had to handle something else that was more important. No explanation while I stood there and waited. Parking They charge 38 per day for self parking if you plan to park a car there. This charge is buried on their site so this may come as a surprise to most guests. There is on street parking but that ends from 2am4am so you are forced to pay to park in the lot. Another charge. Resort Fe You will be charged a 36 per day fee on top of the room rate. Another charge. Swim Bar The bill includes an upcharge to cover some worker wages or something like that. Another charge. Smores If you do have kids they will charge you 15 for smores over a gas fire pit. Bring your own. Are you starting to see the pattern with all of the extra charges. They will nickel and dime you for everything and it can add a significant amount to your final bill.", "offset": [1200, 1297], "date": "2018-03-25", "cpt": "0", "category": "general"}, {"id": 7, "uid": "55aec73f-2208-4bd7-9307-013244bb459d", "sentence": "I can not believe they have no shuttle to the hote from the airport so I had to pay for shuttle both ways.

Note even though it \u2019s a Regency they do not have a Club Lounge anymore. We stayed in the main tower in a corner king ocean view suite. It was very spacious and so cozy to hang out there after a long day of sight seeing. The views were so incredible of Mission Bay Mission Beach and the Pacific Ocean. Loved waking up to the sunrise colors all around me. A review had mentioned loud noise in a corner room but we did n\u2019t hear anything from ours and slept soundly. The only bad part was when sitting on the couch one morning we overheard the phone conversation of the guest next door since it has an adjoining door. The modern coastal decor throughout was great. The grounds were so pretty and peaceful I felt like I could \u2019ve been in Hawaii. There is a nice trail to walk on along the bay and marina with beautiful views.
