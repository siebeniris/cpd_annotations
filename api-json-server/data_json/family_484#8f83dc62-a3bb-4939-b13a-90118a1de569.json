I had the pleasure of staying at this hotel with my group that I travel with every year during the Martin Luther King Holiday. We have traveled together for the last 18 years but I have never received as many compliments from my group as I have concerning this hotel. The staff were a pleasure to work with to book the hotel and once we arrived the staff throughout the hotel were always professional and made our stay one that my group is still complimenting. The rooms were clean and comfortable and the hotel was in the perfect location to all the surrounding sites.

Everyone at the Talbot is extraordinarily friendly and helpful. From the moment we arrived we felt welcome and were never made to feel that we were lesser customers because we were weekend family tourists. Having said that though I will acknowledge we were given a room with a view of the building directly behind nothing scenic but it could have been what was available at early check inThe location was fabulous on the near north side just a few blocks from Muchigan Avenue. There are lots of shops and restaurants in the area including two great cupcake places. The area is bustling and feels very safe and we were able to let our teenager go off shopping and exploring on his own. Our room was very spacious and our special requests for foam pillows and a mini fridge were already in the room and at no extra charge. That reminds me that the Talbot has a nice online early check in process so we could make specific requests and it sent us a text to let us know the room was ready. The decor old English with dark wood and leather was a bit fussy for our tastes but was nicely done in its own style. Our room had two queen beds an armoire with drawers hanging space a keyed mini bar a safe and a TV along with a large desk and chair and two easy chairs with a shared coffee table and lamp. There was a lot of open floor space which was lovely. The only complaint we had was that the toiletries were heavily perfumed citrus and sandlewod and gave me a headache and I am not particularly sensitive. With some effort the staff was able to track down some less smelly products.
