I had heard and been told many nice things about Turnbery Isle Resort and had kept it on my list of places to visit. This past Labor Day my schedule allowed me to organize a trip and stay for the long wekend 3 nights and four days. I am not certain what all the hype was because overall the hotel was just average given its category the service was spotty housekeeping barely mediocre and the golf course was under complete renovation. The disappointing fact is that this was my golfing vacation. When I booked the vacation nowhere was there any information regarding the closure andor the construction on the resort. Furthermore when I called for tee times it was not mentioned. This is just not acceptable for a resort of this type. I am told that once all the construction has been completed the property will become a JW Mariot flagship hotel great does me no good nowAs a summary I have listed the following The God\u2022 Walking distance to Aventura Mall with many good restaurants and a movie theatre\u2022. There is a beach club with free shuttle service\u2022. the valet staff is attentive and good The Average\u2022. the other staff was hit or mis\u2022. The outdoor pool was okay but pool service spotyThe Por\u2022. The property is under construction \u2022. The golf course is a mess of holes described later\u2022. The room was spacious but dirty carpet and smely\u2022. Housekeeping was poor with soiled towels and robesThe Galing\u2022. Not sure what the resort fee charge is supposed to provide since the property is being renovatedPardon the lengthy review as it is my intent to provide some more perspective for new and potential returning guests. The hotel itself is comprised of several buildings with its main entrance and check in and two functioning buildings not sure the destiny of these two but the third was completely torn downIt is heaven for golfers as you walk down from your room have breakfast and the course is right there. The buildings face the 9th and 18th greens of the Miller and Soufer courses. Check in Average minusUpon arrival you are greeted by some very friendly valet staff. I arrived by cab with limited suit cases and was whisked to the check in area. There was one staff member for the 5 people waiting in line and no readily visible priority check in I only saw the placard later but it would not have mattered since there was only one staff memberI had booked a junior suite with resort view. The check in was uninspiring and no upgrade offered as a Gold member. When I inquired I was told that I had a nice room not sure that I asked that particular question. I made sure to keep further inquiries to a minimum. The bellman was affable and talkative as we walked quite a way to the room. Since I arrived at night I could not see any of the construction that enveloped the property. Rom very porThe room chosen was the junior suite resort view. 3435Upon entering the room was large with a king bed and sitting area which had a desk and couch. A small terrace faced the golf course. The bathroom was extremely large and frankly a little wasted space. However the room did smell musty stuffy and \u201c unfresh\u201d. The bathroom which had accents of elegance marble floor and plush bathrobes but was sparse with the customary bathroom amenities Q tips cotton balls mouthwash etc. Instead both a towel and terry cloth bathrobe were soiled. I called housekeeping to make note of these deficiencies. They came 45 minutes later with 16 towels and 4 body washes and shampoos I asked for neither I wanted a tooth brush and mouthwashAfter the first night of enduring an unpleasant smell I figured out that the carpet was the culprit. I had to request this service twice before a gentleman really did spend considerable time tending to this problem. He solved it rather well. With daylight the room did not have a resort golf view. It was one of a palm tree and building next door. Oh well so much for paying extra. Restaurants good service The only restaurant that I frequented was for the breakfast buffet there is another more elegant one at the entrance which serves dinner and candidly is overpriced. Although it was warm sitting outside in the early morning with the golf course view was very relaxing. The staff was extremely nice and service was good. In particular they visited the table frequently. I had the buffet for the entire stay which had an average selection of items and the same choices for every day of the week. I would recommend some creativity and it would not take much. Service hit or misit is really hard to find good help these days. If you hire average you get average. There are some bright spots from the valet bellman and restaurant at breakfast. The rest of the property is below par. Golf course horibleThe property boasts of two golf courses the Miller and the Soufer. The latter is the more difficult one. Both are being renovated with no announcement that this was being done. Frankly I would not have been here if I had known this. In any event the course is chopped up with some holes taken from one course and some from the other to arrive at the required round of 18. From the Miller holes 1 through 9 and then holes 13 through 16. Completed these 13 holes you take the cart and migrate to the Soufer course and play holes 10 through 14The driving range is on hole 12 of the Miller and the putting green is on number 17This is not my idea of how to spend time and 120 per round. In summary there is no need to spend top dollar for this resort or for that matter visit it. The attention to detail from service to amenities does not reconcile with the price paid. There are many other hotels in the Miami area that have a better offering both with the property and with the surrounding golf courses. This was definitely an underwhelming experience.", "offset": [3135, 3190], "date": "2017-10-12", "cpt": "1", "category": "room"}, {"id": 11, "uid": "8e844f28-4226-4c6c-b42b-fec05f480be5", "sentence": "Business Conference Week.

Very different property now I stayed here twice with family during a one week period and until now this hotel had been my favorite in the Miami area. The switch to JW Mariot is a big step down from the Turnbery brand that its management carefully cultivated over the years. they have gone to mass production and conventions and decidedly down market. The problem so far is that things are not really working well we saw luggage going to the wrong room computer stations consistently not working and staff people not knowing things they should know and not being prepared to go out of their way to make things work until a manager stepped in. One time we checked in at 10 pm and our room was still not ready and although our reservation was marked with connecting rooms we did not get them that night they did offer to move us the next day. In the new tower the air conditioning works well the shower water pressure is fair but not particularly good and the rooms are pretty nice although for a new tower i was surprised at how stained our carpet was in one of the rooms already. The hotel was busy and I was not too happy that at 10 pm on a Saturday night room service was backed up an hour and the hotels coffee shop was closed. We ate appetizers in one of the fine dining restaurants that was still open and the front desk comped our dinner which I found out later and which was rather nice of them and unexpected. When we checked in we called 3 times over a 2 hour period to get some door stoppers for our connecting rooms. We waited about half an hour to get our car from the valet. It does not help that when you call on the telephone people do not answer their extensions and we never succeeded the entire stay in reaching the car valets over the phone which is a problem because they tell you to call 15 minutes in advance to allow time to get your car. I would recommend ditching the car for a stay here and just use Uber. The front desk did not reach them either. I was upset that they do not get the New York Times at the hotel and you can not buy it at the sundry shop either. The Wall Street Journals they kept in a closet were gone before 9 am. I never saw a concierge in the lobby so I do not know if there is one. The front desk person said she did not know when the concierge shows up and I was perturbed because I thought that someone whose station is right in front of the concierge desk ought to know what goes on across from them. But that is what you are now getting here staff people who are not really part of a whole hotel but just compartmentalized in their own little worlds. The new pool area is a bit like a theme park you go through an entrance area with turnstyles and a scan of your wrist band to make sure you can enter. The pool area is cool in design with warm water and the water slides are average. no big deal but nice. It is hard to get shade which is really tough in the hot summer sun and by 11 it is hard to find a lounge. You have to climb a tower of about 4 5 stories for each ride and there is a limit as to how many times anyone is willing to do this. The Flow Rider is hugely busy they make you sign a waiver each and every day and my kids just gave up looking at the long lines to get on it. The hotel sells day passes and we saw a lot of people paying for things with cash and credit card which is a good sign that they are day pass guests the hotel is cheapening its resort by letting too many outsiders in to give their guests a good experience and it is not a relaxing place by any means as you might hope for in a resort. The crowd at the pool is different than it used to be and you see a lot of body paint around. Breakfast at the Corsair has definitely been Mariotized they got rid of many things they used to have and the quality is definitely down. A few years ago a buffet breakfast here was in the top 10 of hotels in America in my opinion and my wife was taking home recipes for home made cakes. The elevators in the tower have temporary certificates in them that expired in March and it is 3 months later. I saw the county inspector there and nobody seems to be bothered by it because the certificates are in the office but good management puts up their certificates and this kind of thing adds to the feeling that the place is just becoming too large to be managed well and that management is just not on it and walking the floor. I really got the feeling throughout that Mariot did not send in their A Team to take over this property when it opened up its new tower and shifted its focus to groups. I do not think that guests of Turnbery are going to want to be put on hold with a recording for several minutes every time they want to talk to someone at the hotel and have lots of extensions simply not picking up the phone ie for instance the front desk tried to call the business center at 9 am and nobody picked up. Three elevators for a 17 story tower is not enough especially when bellmen are using the same elevators for check ins and check outs and when one elevator goes out as it did when we were there. The hotel is dominated by groups and can not handle the turnover they told us that they could not possibly clean 400 rooms by 10 pm. One morning at breakfast there was only one person manning the omlete station and a line of 8 people waiting. Lifeguards at the pool do not have bandaids around and the person watching the exit of the water slide can not tell you where a pair of lost goggles in that pool goes from there. Lots of people wait in line at the front desk and computers do not work. You get the idea. The hotel has so many promotions going on that when you check out you really have to go over your bill to make sure the proper credits have been applied. It used to be very hard to use Mariot points at this property you can now use them which also means you have more guests coming with points than paying cash which is a disincentive for a property to provide quality goods and services. The gym here remains excellent and the spa is OK they need investment there. The Swiss shower was being repaired when I visited and it was the same thing last time I was there a year or so ago. A resort like this should have a better spa more than just a waiting area and some treatment rooms a locker room and a sauna. My feeling is that the way forward for this place is to take one of the buildings such as Jasmine and make that a boutique hotel within a hotel that runs at a 5star level and cater to their clientele with that carve out. Otherwise the kind of guests that would go to Turnbery will probably be looking for another property to take its place. We would not think of going back unles we knew that this place got its act together. Hardly anything we did here was hassle free and I do not care how cheap it is it is not what I want in a resort. I saw a VIP area at the pool area but if I were a VIP I do not know that I would want to be here in the first place. I wonder why the owner trashed his own brand to do this I guess he thought this kind of mass market property would be more profitable.
