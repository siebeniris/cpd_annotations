We have been to many five star all inclusive resorts about two or more trips a year for more than a decade. We fell in love with Excellence Resorts and had spent the last 8 consecutive trips at Excellence twice at Excellence Mayan Riviera the rest at Excellence Playa Mujeres which we prefered EPM is slightly newer and has many more rooftop terrace rooms with a private pool available. We decided to try LeBlanc for a change of pace attracted by the reviews claiming a serene upscale environment with tremendous service. We prefer a very quiet and relaxed vacation venue hence our tendency to book a rooftop terrace room at EPM. most days at EPM we never left our room and were able to avoid the commotion of the main pools. In this review I will compare our LeBlanc experience to our many experiences at Excellence Resorts. ARIVALWe pre arranged our airport transfer with CancunTrasferscom I highly recommend. Easy booking and online pre payment much cheaper than the Seasons Tours service we have used via Excellence. On departure from Toronto we emailed about our flight being delayed and received an instant response back. Driver arrived 10 min early for our trip back to the airport. Will definitely use them again. Arrival at LeBlanc was disappointing as our check in happened to coincide with that of a large conference group that was quite rowdy. Regardless were were welcomed immediately and there was no delay in taking us to our room. The butler explained a few things but did not make any effort to point out the location of the restaurants or pools. At Excellence they are equally gracious at check in beverage cold towel immediate service and the lobby is a bit more impressive although no ocean view the bell boy points out all of the pertinent amenities as they take you to your room. ROMWe requested a king bed and were given a room with two doubles. My request to change to a king room was met with we do not have a king bed available in YOUR ROOM CATEGORY. At Excellence PM one year I was unhappy with our room location and they upgraded us to their top room The Imperial Suite we were VERY impresedWe did not find the room too small and did not miss having a balcony. Lovely views of the sunset on the lagoon side. Bothered by the sound of a jacuzi draining one night and awoke to the sound of a neighbours TV one morning despite earplugs. but otherwise did not find the noise to be a problem. I would say that the rooms at Excellence are comparably luxurious and well appointed and a bit larger and all have balconies with outside seatingAMBIENCEDespite the higher price tag LB did not seem all that much classier than Excellence. We enjoyed the music that plays throughout the resort very zen and relaxing like what would be playing in the background at a spa while you are having a massage and the musicians at the lobby bar each evening were very talented. We were hoping for a more sedate and shal we say well behaved crowd but there were plenty of rowdies and drunkards woo hoers etc. Did the convention contribute. Hard to say. It felt like any other resort we had been to. We escaped the noise and revellers by using the Luna pool and third floor pool. At Excellence PM we escape the noise by booking a rooftop terrace room with our own pool and preferentially a spa view room so we do not have to hear the pounding dance music and pool games of the main Excellence pool. This was our first time staying on the main hotel strip in Cancun and in a high rise hotel style resort. We were happy to find that the atmosphere was equally relaxing we definitely felt as though we were at a resort and not just guests at a typical hotel. There was a bit of polside noise microphone announcements from the neighbouring hotel but only briefly each day. FOOD DRINKLeBlancs food is marginally superior to that of Excellence. We enjoyed the Italian Asian and French restaurants equally. We really loved the breakfast by the pool on the third floor breakfast Caesar salad and eggs Benedict were fabulous. Pizza for lunch was quite good. Room service was a bit quicker at LeBlanc compared to Excellence at LB we enjoyed having a bottle of champagne and their delicious smoked salmon and shrimp cocktail appetizers each night as we got ready for the evening. Breakfast buffet was standard comparable to Excellence. We really love having an Indian restaurant option at Excellence. Tips at the LB Italian restaurant avoid the chicken a chicken breast hammered out to a millimetre thickness and breaded no sauce and the saltimboca was unimpressive. At LB the nachos we ordered at the beach were soggy on arrival and the burrito was deep fried not what we were expecting. We thought it was great that the breakfast options at LB were open until 1130 nice not to feel rushed to finish our morning workout before breakfast. Comparable drinks menus house wines. Grey Goose readily available at LB but only in the Excellence Club area of EPMSERVICEWhen compared to Excellence service was marginally better at LeBlanc. Both resorts have wonderful friendly hard working staff who treat guests like royalty regardless of tipping we usually try to distribute about twenty to thirty dollars a day in tips but do not feel that we had get different service if we did not at both LB and EPM. We had a sour experience on the beach at LB on our first day the waitress was not at all friendly felt like we were bothering her almost and our snacks lunch took an hour to arrive. This was an anomaly the remainder of the service was exceptional. Overall I think that our expectations of LeBlanc were inflated by the many reviews of over the top service. I will say that the restaurant service is more efficient compared to Excellence the LeBlanc restaurants were all very appropriately staffed. GYMExcelent at both LB and EPM. Lots of machines well air conditioned. was not interested in any of the classes at LB but enjoy the boot camp style classes at EPMSPANot a spa person. have not used the spa facilities at either resort so can not comment. BEACH POLSBeautiful beach at LeBlanc I would say a bit nicer than the beach at EPM. No problems finding a chair and umbrella at any of the LB pools versus at Excellence it seems a bit more challenging to find one of the coveted chairs with a shade option lots of 6 am lounge chair claiming. SUMARYBoth LeBlanc and Excellence are high end luxurious 5 star resorts. Looking at price Excellence seems to be a better value overall. Based on our recent bookings the room rates seem to drop in the off shoulder season at Excellence but not at LeBlanc. We will happily return to both resorts with our decision likely being based on the price of a basic LB room versus a rooftop terrace room at EPM. This trip taught me that unfortunately even the highest resort price tag can not guarantee that fellow guests will behave appropriately and with class.

My husband my brother my sister in law and I stayed at the Le Blanc from January 14th19th. My brother and sister in law vacation there annually this was our first stay. The best word to describe this resort is relaxing. it is a mininalistic decor very white very tranquil. I think I needed a little pop of color lol. We were greeted at the door with coconut milk in champagne glasses. Given warm neck wraps at the desk while checking in a nice touch. Our room was upgraded as they were not fully booked. The room was beautiful. A small standing balcony on one side and a larger sitting balcony on the other. A 2 person jacuzi tub with a window view and stand up dual shower. Very comfortable bed. The main infinity pool was breathtaking with a full view of the ocean. There were 3 restaurants an Asian Fusion an Italian and a French. The French required a time reservation. Also a buffet style restaurant for breakfast lunch dinner. All were very good. The spa is definitely a highlight extremely tranquil. Male and female facilities were separate and robes or swimsuits were worn at all times. Couplet treatments were available. My husband and I had a couples hot stone massage awesome. There are 3 pools the main infinity pool a 3rd floor smaller infinity pool and a pool by the spa. And one jacuzi. The ocean was amazing. light blue water soft sand. There were always chairs available. The staff was incredible and very accommodating. A butler at every floor. My only concern was that there was not much night life. There was a violinist and a cellist and a bar room that hosted a dj one night and a band another. Luckily the tour desk offered things to do for those of us who can only relax for so long. We booked 2 tours a party boat tour Xoximilco which was a lot of fun just a few hours. And we took the tour to Chichen Itza with the sink hole Ik Kil which was amazingAnother thing worth mentioning was we were given resort and tour credits but they did come with exclusions for example the spa caps off at 500 credits and the tour I wanted did not apply at all although others did. And taxes applied to everything. Just something I would have liked to have known before hand in addition to the all inclusive price. Overall it was a very posh and relaxing resort the perfect place to get away and decompress while being pampered in luxury.

Your Butler will escort you to your room and fully explain any and all aspects of what is needed to know about room and all of the resorts services. The rooms are gorgeous. Open plan two closets.

Hard to choose between shower of bath so I did both. On to the beach Pool area. I have been a lot of destinations in the Caribbean but other than St Lucia this location is the most beautiful location I have seen. The sand is powder white the water is very blue and clear. The beach is on a quite end and not many people. The pool are is fabulous. Plenty of lounge chairs and quite places to lay out. The infinity pool looks heavenly and the swim up bar is great. Total top shelf liquors. I have only been to two resorts in my travels that actually carries my brand of cognac. It was nice to be able to drink what I like and buy at home. The food and service was wonderful. The restaurants are designed with elegance and luxury in mind. Everywhere you go in this place it is beautiful There is even a full service business center that is private comfortable that allows you to take care of any business needed.

Amazing staff. Loved Carlos. Beach was beautiful. Staff and food were the best we have ever had at an all inclusive. We have stayed at many secrets and excellence and iberostar. As well as some others but we have never had better food or service. Very easy trip from the airport. Great bed and loved the small touches like pillow menu and preferred scent for our room. Have had better rooms before and we loved the swim out room to the lazy river at excellence but the other things made up for that. The spa was wonderful as well. Even though it was to short of a trip we had one of the best times. We have done many different resorts and ended up here because we were meeting some friends. I had no expectations but we could not have been happier. We did not have a long trip so we did not do anything else but go to the spa and hang out on the beach. We loved watching the baby turtles get released. We like to do watersports like sailing and sea kayaks.

Stay was great If you are looking for a trip that is strictly RR. then Le Blanc is for you. Service was terrific food was good not great although we never did make it to the French restaurant because of a last minute scuba trip that conflicted with our reservation time. Pools and beaches are gorgeous. USE THE RESORT CREDITS. We used ours for a romantic dinner on the beach a spa day for my wife a cabana on the beach and a dinner upgrade lobster tails in the Italian restaurant. While we did have to pay the 16 tax on all of these things totaling about 200 it was worth it. The butler on each floor is a nice touch if you need ice ring the butler and he will bring it. I had ours prepare a scented jacuzi in our room one day. so it was ready once we got back from the beach. Another day I had him decorate the room as a surprise for my wife on our anniversary. Tipping is a real pain. but I felt a necessity while an all inclusive does offer you the ability to not have to worry about carrying cash I pretty much tipped everyone all day long because each employee really does bend over backwards to cater to you every need. I watched at dinner most people did not leave tips. but I did. Budget 50 75 day for tipping. I did ask upon arrival if they could upgrade us to a higher floor room with an ocean view explaining we were celebrating an anniversary. After the guy at the front desk went to talk to his manager he did come back and tell me he could upgrade us for 30 nite. While I was hoping for a free upgrade I did spend the 30 nite. I did ask for a late checkout which they really did not give me they allowed me to stay for 1 extra hour. My flight was not until early evening and I was hoping for a 3 pm checkout so we could stay on the beach until the last possible minute and then shower etc before going to the airport normal checkout is 12 pm they gave me until 1pm. Could you go somewhere else for less money and have an amazing time. of course. but the bottom line is if you can afford to stay here and are looking for a relaxing vacation where the hotel caters to your every whim this is the place to go.", "offset": [1231, 1367], "date": "2017-04-06", "cpt": "0", "category": "room"}, {"id": 6, "uid": "ef1549a5-29c6-4897-a8a6-58421ad538a7", "sentence": "Relaxation at its finest. My husband and I just returned from a four night stay at Le Blanc and we had a wonderfully relaxing vacation. Highlights Service as previous reviewers have mentioned service is top notch at Le Blanc. Everyone you encounter from the doorman at the entry to the servers on the beach are genuine in their efforts to help. When you say \u2018 thank you \u2019 the staff replies \u2018 it \u2019s my pleasure \u2019. Any time we would ask someone for directions they would stop what they were doing and walk us over to where we were headed. Our butlers Alex and Joel were awesome. My husband and I were celebrating our 14th wedding anniversary. For our last night Joel decorated our hotel room with rose petals and balloons and left a lovely bottle of sparkling wine and chocolate covered strawberries. We spent three full days at the beach literally from 9 am 5 pm and all three of the servers Jesus Jahil and I forgot the name of the third gentleman. on the beach took amazing care of us. At each restaurant the wait staff was courteous and friendly. Each time a manager visited our table a couple of times to check on us. Finally we received a couple of calls throughout our stay from management inquiring on our stay Beach pool area the beach is lovely. Caribbean blue water with white sand. We opted to spend our resort credit towards a cabana each day as all we wanted to do was lay by the beach and relax. The main pool area is gorgeous with an infinity pool overlooking the ocean and a lovely swim up bar. If you are not one for sand you will still enjoy the beauty of the ocean without setting foot on the beach. there is also a smaller quieter pool on the other side of the hotel. Finally there is also a hammock in the shade Food and drinks absolutely delicious. The international buffet had a delicious spread for breakfast. Isabel cheerfully made delicious eggs omelets and even crepes for me each morning. We ate every lunch on the beach which was also tasty. There was no shortage of awesome cocktails we tried many of them and even some mocktails. We enjoyed all three of the restaurants Asian Italian and French the Italian was our favorite minus the dessert which was too avant garde. Top shelf liquor and Chilean wine were included we never felt the need to \u2018 upgrade \u2019 our food or alcohol. All of the little things that add up When you arrive you \u2019re greeted with a champagne glass of coconut milk and a neck wrap. You can get cold rosewater towels at the pool and on the beach to cool off. Turn down service includes a couple of small chocolates and \u2018 good night \u2019 playing on the TV. There \u2019s an Apple TV in your room which we used to stream and watch our favorite TV shows. Wifi is free and there \u2019s a strong signal throughout the resort. The gym which was massive with plenty of equipment offers free classes including aquatic yoga every morning in the pool. A couple of watch outs Room we had a royal deluxe partial ocean view room on the 9th floor. It \u2019s very romantic complete with a massive Jacuzi tub in the middle of the room and a very large shower with dual heads. My only peeve is that the sink area is not separate from the rest of the room. So if someone is trying to watch TV or sleep they can hear the sink blowdryer etc. loud and clear. Also there \u2019s not an actual door separating the toilet from the room it \u2019s a frosted glass door which is lovely but again not ideal for any sort of privacy. Resort credit. my husband and I agreed from the beginning that we wanted to use our entire resort credit towards a beach cabana for each day of our stay. I made the reservation in advance so that we would be set and also to avoid the up sell timeshare discussion that other reviewers have mentioned. Despite this every day someone was reaching out to discuss our resort credit. The first day we avoided it by going to lunch as soon as we checked in then someone called our room as soon as we walked in. Then each day thereafter someone called our room. I politely explained each time that there was nothing to discuss that our plans were set. My favorite was the last call I received saying that we had to visit the guest services table to ensure that their system charged everything properly. I have complete appreciation for folks trying to do their job but the repeated calls on this topic bordered on harassment. This is the one area that Le Blanc management needs to address once someone says no do not continue to call them and request that they stop by the desk for an in person discussion. No means no over the phone and in person. All in all we had an amazing time. It was exactly the respite we were seeking from the hustle and bustle of everyday life. I have no doubt we \u2019l strongly consider returning to Le Blanc on our next getaway.", "offset": [3805, 3929], "date": "2017-06-02", "cpt": "0", "category": "room"}, {"id": 7, "uid": "9b562c69-857c-4b36-95cb-cd8e723bf6ac", "sentence": "Great 2nd trip at Le Blanc. This was our 2nd 3 day trip to Le Blanc. We went last year at the same time and loved it so we did it again and had almost as much fun. We ate at Lumier twice and Blancitalia. The food was always great. House wine OK but the upgraded wine is no better. The place was nearly empty I think I heard 40 occupancy so we almost felt like we had the place to ourselves. I am not sure if that was why it seemed like there were not as much staff. One small disappointment is the city or whoever is in charge of the beach did no remove the seaweed but that might have been because of the baby sea turtles were hatching and heading to the ocean while we were there. Our biggest complaint was the spa. It is a gorgeous spa but is extremely over priced. My wife and I splurged and both got 80 minute massages even with 150 resort credit it cost us 500. My massage was OK but my wife had a deep tissue that was anything but. They have a sauna steam room and all sort of pools and whirlpools but there is no explanation of anything so you just try it. With such a beautiful expensive spa the experience should include a better tour and explanation of the facilities that are very underutilized. I do not think we will be paying for any more spa services if we return to Le Blanc. Room information. There is little information on the different Jr Suites. Last trip we stayed in a ocean front Jr suite. There is only one per floor and end in 15. We stayed in 815 it is a corner room with great ocean views from both french balconies. It is a large room with a split level. This year we wanted a real balcony. We stayed in another junior suite room 724. Again it was a corner room so the bed looked towards the lagoon and that was the french balcony. The real balcony had a full ocean view. It was very nice but it had less square footage because it had a balcony. If we were to stay here again we would probably take the ocean front with no balcony which we rarely used. One thing I love about the junior suites is that bathroom is so much nicer. It has a larger vanity and shower and the Jacuzi is in the bathroom and looks out of a window. this gives much more space and privacy that the regular rooms or honeymoon suites. So unles you want to spend a lot more for a governors suite I would highly recommend the Jr Suite especially ocean front.

My husband and I just got back home from our 6 day trip to the absolutely perfect Le Blanc Spa and Resort in Cancun Mexico. There are not enough words to explain how amazing this place is. I found this resort by searching the top places to visit in Cancun. Le Blanc is rated 1 in Cancun for a reason. The moment walked through the doors we were treated like royalty. Anything you can possibly imagine is catered to you. It \u2019s insane when you do n\u2019t even have to carry your own plate at a buffet. We spent 4 full days at the beach. We would walk down at around 100am and instantly someone was bringing you an umbrella ice buckets with water bottles and of course anything you wanted to eat or drink. Everyone we met was so happy and friendly but how could you possibly be anything but ecstatic in a place like Le Blanc. Make sure you have your butler set you up with the bubble bath at night. It \u2019s definitely the perfect way to end your day. Elise at the lobby bar in the morning is the happiest bartender and goes above and beyond to make sure that your drink is not only delicious but beautiful too. The 3rd floor food was our favorite food and the fried calamari after 6 pm is amazing. We spent most of our nights at the 3rd floor bar because that \u2019s where the best shows are. Our butlers Maritio and Antonio on the 7th floor were absolutely perfect. We could n\u2019t have asked for better people. We had a Governor Suite on the 7th floor and it was spectacular. It is definitely worth the price for a large balcony. David at the beach was always a pleasure and he made sure we had a new drink even before we had finished the one we were already drinking. For us there WILL be a next time. We have never in our lives been so happy and comfortable. If you have heard anything negative about this resort please disregard it. We have nothing negative to say. And we are very young. If you are ready to relax and have someone cater to your every whim please give Le Blanc a shot. There is no way you could ever regret it. Until next time Le Blanc.

We were checked in given orientation and the person who checked us in took time to explain everything. We were asked if we wanted our butler to unpack our luggage for us. Our butler.

He had to redo it because timing was off and as it was a surprise it was lukewarm by the time I got back. We were able to order room service any hour of the day. Top shelf liquor in our rooms even. All the restaurants were amazing. The only one negative comment is their choice in wines. I think they can do much better. They have top shelf everything but then their wine list consists of low end brands. I just stuck w cocktails. I can not wait to go back after their remodel.

We vacationed for 8 days at the Adults only Leblanc Spa Resort February 11 to February 19 2019. This is our 8th consecutive year at this fabulous resort and we were especially excited for this visit as the entire resort had just been completely renovated and reopened in December after a lengthy shutdown. Pick up was easy quick and comfortable by Juan Carlos a wonderful LeBlanc driver who also saw to our safe return to the airport upon leaving. Juan is certainly a gentleman and delightful with whom to travel. The private transportation is great and time saving. The resort is only 25 minutes from the airport. Our arrival welcome was warm and friendly as always and we were greeted by Roger our Diamond Concierge with our favorite adult beverages. All of our Spa requests and dinner requests were completed before our arrival therefore our private check in was a breeze. We are very grateful for the great job always by Roger. Our arrival into the completely renovated lobby area was spectacular. The transformation was incredible and warmly inviting. Everywhere you looked it was special. It was a pleasure to be greeted at the front desk Ericka clearly an asset to Leblanc. Then straight off to our room with our bags handled by Bellman Isai. Fine jobWe were celebrating our anniversary at a LeBlanc which has become a tradition with us. This year again our chosen room was the one bedroom presidential with a jacuzi on a large balcony and with ocean views from each room perfect on the 9th floor corner. We could n\u2019t have chosen better anywhere. The housekeeping service was perfect every day. The floor Butlers were awesome always available and gracious and willing to help with any detail. We are grateful to Santiago and Marco for their fine service. Special thanks to both. Marco set up a beautiful flower petaled jacuzi and several balloons in our room for our 42nd anniversary. Many thanks for our pleasant surprise. An added bonus is all the friendly greetings from all the Butlers we \u2019ve had during previous visits. What a great group of guysLeblanc has a very beautiful tropical feel with many palm trees near the pools on the most beautiful section of beach in all of Cancun. We love the three pools and beach at the Leblanc. The beach in this area is the widest on this section of the hotel strip and has a breathtaking view of all the beautiful blue shades of the Caribbean water. The beach area has received a renovation as well. There are now over 50 palm trees an additional 10 shade offering canopies along with the 8 cabanas and numerous 2 person hammocks among the palm trees. What once was beautiful is outstanding now. The pool concierges Laura Henry Lucinda Jesus and Mauricio were always pleasant and hustling about to make sure that we had everything we needed in their area. We look forward to seeing this elite group every year. The stand out cabana beach waiters were Jair Victor Daniel Jesus Fardie Oscar. They were equally so friendly pleasant and efficient at their jobs. Life on the beach was so comfortable because of their services. On the beach was lifeguard Hernando maintaining a watchful eye on those who entered the water. He was constantly hustling providing chairs umbrellas and towels for all the beach guests while continuously being aware of the swimmers. He is awesomeAl the pool and beach servers did a fantastic job as always. They were always available providing the best service beverages and snacks that anyone could possibly want. These incredible people Jorge Chris Jeanete and David were always pleasantly taking care of everyone and at the Luna pool were great pool bartenders Ignacio and Rolando. Many thanks to everyone. We dined in all of the restaurants several times. Managers of special recognition are Marco Omar at the Blanc International Mexican Antoneta at the Yama Japanese and Fernando at the French Lumiere. Renan and Viridiana at the re designed Terrace restaurant. This Terrace has been totally transformed with full menu restaurant all day and evening. Special notice to hostesses Vanessa and Jesica. These ladies did a fine job. The food and service was always good to excellent at all locations. The dinners at all the restaurants were exciting beautifully presented and most of all delicious. There are many outstanding Chefs behind the scenes providing excellent food and desserts. I can not overlook wonderful breakfast cook Isabel. Beautiful smile every dayWe enjoyed wine offerings and suggestions from Sommelier Fabian Ravier. He is a special man and goes out of his way to find a great pairing. Always a pleasure to be with him at dinner. We also had a couple of special dinners during our stay. Our 42nd anniversary dinners in the Blanc restaurant and Lumiere were fantastic. We also enjoyed fine dining outside in the Palafito as well. This dinner was prepared by Italian Chef Ren\u00e9. They were outstanding pasta dishes. All the chefs and waiters made it all very special. A job well done. Standout waiters throughout our stay were in the Blanc for breakfast and lunch each day Manuel Elias Jos\u00e9 and Juan. Mexican dinners were Hernan and Roger what a great sense of humor and helper Hector. In particular Hector being a new employee has the tremendous potential to become a greater asset to Leblanc. He is a very personable young man and so easy to talk to. Alberto at the Japanese restaurant did a fantastic job. Special service was provided at the Lumiere French restaurant by manager Fernando. We have a special place in our hearts for the servers at Lumiere Cesar Carlos Edgar Many and Alejandro and we look forward to seeing their smiles and super service each visit. Daytime Nightly entertainment was arranged by Alfonso entertainment manager. Great job keeping guests involved. The completely remodeled Cav\u00f3 Lounge was very nice and comfortable and made enjoyable by the terrific service provided by Rafael one of our favorites. He is always so kind and jolly Great jobThe spa service appointments were made before hand so we did not have to wait to make any appointments. An excellent salon mani pedi from Carmen on loan for 1 day from Moon Sunrise. We had massages several times. Special thanks to Spa therapists Isidia Georgina Maricarmen Alexandria Eva Elisa and Men \u2019s Spa helper Pablo. All of the people were the best at their profession. They are all very special. Just go there and be pamperedLeblanc is never a disappointment. If you want the very best in a quiet adults only resort then look no further. You will want to return again and again. The staff at this resort are very special. Some of those who make it the best are led by General Manager Jana\u00ed Valdez and his assistant Leslie Velez. They are such an excellent team of leaders. Public relations assistants Bruno and Elizabeth Marquez did an exceptional job in their customer communications. We were very happy to have spent time with the gifted kindness and wonderful personality of Elizabeth. Both are wonderful assets to Leblanc.

I had been meaning to experience Le Blanc for awhile and was happy to get to do so. From the moment that we checked in the front desk already knew my name very impressive. We arrived late in the afternoon and after checking in we were met by our butler Juan who gave us a brief tour around the lobby and explained all the perks in our room. We tried Bela Italian that night and the food was amazing. Our waiter Baldemar might be misspelled was AMAZING. He knew exactly what to recommend so we could enjoy our dinner. We ate so much that we woke up the next day to try the gym. They have the most up to date and fully equipped gym equipment. You can do your own thing or try one of the scheduled classes see the Le Blanc ap for times. The rooms are VERY relaxing with one of the best beds I \u2019ve ever slept in. The room has a mini bar with snacks and drinks liquor dispenser an expreso machine they had me at expreso double jacuzi branded beach bag CHI iron and blow dryer and so on. We got a room with lagoon view and got to see the sunset every evening. Really there is NO room with bad view here. all depends on your preference Do you want to see the sun rise or set. The best part are the amenities from not having to worry about carrying your purse with you at all time it is all included. We carried small amount of cash with us to tip but it \u2019s not mandatory. it depends on each traveler. Literally just need to bring your clothes with you. The spa is amazing and it is a must if staying here. Consider doing the hydrotheraphy before and I would recommend getting the aromatherapy massage 50 min ask for Geraldine or Gemma. We stayed for 3 days and got to try all of the restaurants including their signature Lumiere. This one requires reservation so make sure you book in advance with your butler or at the Le Blanc ap. The staff is amazing everyone is beyond friendly and service oriented. The butlers spoiled us with aromatheraphy and organic scented soap every night. We had such an amazing time and are looking forward to come back. If you are looking to relax and unwind this is the place.", "offset": [780, 854], "date": "2019-03-31", "cpt": "1", "category": "room"}, {"id": 12, "uid": "5cc2a314-095f-4923-95f9-662d22771095", "sentence": "Service extraordinaire. Loved our trip to Le Blanc Cancun with our best friends. Every single thing from the guest rooms with our own butler to the dining to the lovely pools and beach was geared towards pampering guests. An example of their desire to please was the evening we were having cocktails in the lobby bar before dinner. My bestie and I both wanted dirty martinis and the bartender realized they had no blue cheese stuffed olives. So what did he do he stuffed olives with blue cheese to make sure we could have our dirty martini. Who does that. Le Blanc does that.", "offset": [81, 221], "date": "2019-05-14", "cpt": "1", "category": "room"}, {"id": 13, "uid": "7919e771-5756-4b31-82a4-bfea2fafcbea", "sentence": "Amazing resort. Already planning our return trip. Le Blanc is amazing. This was our second time here our first time was 10 years ago for our honeymoon and we decided to return for our 10 year anniversary trip. We had an outstanding 10 year anniversary trip. We had such an amazing time we are already planning our return trip. As soon as you walk into the lobby you are greeted by friendly staff members and an amazing scent which I later found out was cucumber mint I bought two reed diffusers from the gift shop I highly recommend them. Check in was a breeze and much to our surprise our room was upgraded for our anniversary which was amazing. Definitely the nicest room we have ever stayed in. The pool areas are all amazing there are plenty of chairs and umbrellas with plenty of sun or shade. The main pool overlooking the ocean loses sun in the late afternoon but the other pool near the lagoon is blazing sun until it sets. We enjoyed a lot of time at both pools. The service at the pool is also amazing the towel service the buckets of ice with bottles of water the drinks and the food were all outstanding. We truly were blown away by the service. The food was also outstanding every meal we ate was fantastic. I especially enjoyed the outdoor dining options at Terazo the food and views were great and they offer breakfast lunch and dinner. The margarita pizza was my favorite and it was great that food was also served at the pool. The beach area was fantastic and we really enjoyed the beach bar. The spa was also fantastic.

Butler is a nice added feature to have available but she was not always accessible and at her desk station. Needed to make a reservation for the Fine Dining restaurant but it ended up to be our least favorite meal. The Japanese and Italian dining were fabulous. The staff in both restaurants were very attentive. The rooms are a bit damp and wet. All our belongings were damp when we packed up. Wish the restaurants were all offer bottled water instead of still or sparkling water poured from pitcher. Some days our water smelled awful and we could not drink it. It had scaly floaters in the water at lunch. Lobby bar was always staffed well and quick. Delicious skinny margaritas. Good selection of flavored vodkas. The first day to get the luggage took a long time which was disappointing when first arriving. Also wish we could have been offered a mimosa rather than coconut milk not our thingLoved the selection of chocolates and coffees in coffee shop. The staff was always busy and people were waiting in line at the coffee shop. Thanks for offering crepes they were delicious. We had 2 out of 4 great nights of entertainment. Slow on the entertainment staff. Chip guacamole and salsa always a great choice inside and out by the polAl 4 of us purchased sunglasses in the gift shop onsite and used 75 of our resort credit only to find out when we got to the airport we could have purchased them for 100 less. do not buy at the resortWish the bathroom would have more room and 2 sinks.

We have just returned from our visit to Le Blanc. What can I say WOW. This place is amazing we stayed for two weeks and I thought before we arrived that the lack of restaurants may cause a problem as we usually stay at Moon Palace Cancun and that has about 20 but no I was so surprised the menus are pretty extensive with plenty of choices. The first thing that I would like to say about this resort is everything works nothing is broken or missing or hanging off the wall. We are Palace Elite Diamond Members and right from our arrival outside the airport we were pampered by our driver Juan Carlos who was waiting for us to drive us to the Hotel with a flower and a cocktail menu for our arrival drink he was fantastic such a joy. Upon our arrival our Concierge Roger was waiting to greet us with our chosen cocktail which was a wonderful touch he was the the most amazing guy he made our stay so easy anything we needed he would sort out. We had two amazing butlers on our floor Rene and Juan they also made our lives very easy making dinner reservations and anything thing we required in our room I only had to ask them once and it would appear I never had to ask again. Whilst we were in resort we were celebrating our Wedding Anniversary and they decorated our room ran a Spa filled with Rose Petals and left Champagne Chocolates and a lovley note wishing us a Happy Anniversary which was wonderful. Here are my recommendations for the Restaurants and the staff who really stood out for us and in this Hotel its very difficult because all of the staff are so friendly and if someone passes you and you are just standing maybe waiting for your Husband. they will say \u201c Are you ok Miss. can I help you with something \u201d. Which is just so sweet. The TerazaExcelent for breakfast Lunch and Dinner the amazing staff are Vividiana Uri Rubicel Juan Carlos and Alberto who work in the morning and at Lunchtime and in the evening time this is the Steak restaurant where our friend had the 46 oz TomaHawknot for the faint hearted using his resort credits and I had the Lobster which was probably the best Lobster I \u2019ve ever had also with Resort Credit Andrea works in the evening as the hostess and Marco and Bryan the waiters who are amazing also. The Bela This restaurant is amazing if you like Italian food I can personally recommend the Rigatoni it \u2019s out of this world just like mama used to make. they also serve fresh Serano Ham and Parmesan accompanied by freshly baked breads. The staff are also amazing I would like to thank Anna Maria for always making us feel so very welcome upon arrival she is such a sweet girl and a very hard worker she is the hostess however we would regularly see her clearing tables and helping to turn around the tables so that they could accommodate more dinners and not have to turn them away a credit to the company. Lorenzo was quite often our waiter who took real good care of us as did Juan and Alexandro I would also like to thank Chef Rene who always did an amazing job on the food. The Yama RestaurantThis is the Japanese the food in here is also excellent a very wide variety of food I can recommend the Beef cooked on Hot Stones which you cook yourself and the Duck we were very well looked after in here by Omar the Manager and Alexandro the waiter. Apparently the hotel has a Sommelier called Fabian which I have seen on some reviews on here however I only ever saw him wandering about the restaurants carrying a bottle of wine the person who really took great care of us and knew exactly what wine we wanted to drink with our meals within a couple of times of serving us was Renan he was absolutely amazing and such a wonderful down to earth guy with a wonderful sense of humour it was a real pleasure to meet him. The Lumiere What a wonderful dining experience I would just like to add if you like an ambiance and a relaxed dining experience then this is the place for you as this is exactly what it is you are never left without anything to eat or drink in front of you however the experience is about 2 hours which is fine for us as we enjoy savouring our food and drink etc but if you want to eat very quickly I suggest the Buffet Baldemar took such good care of us and he also has a wonderful sense of humour. The Hotel is located right upon the beach with the Ocean the most gorgeous shades of turquoise that you would expect from the Caribbean Sea even on cloudy days of which we had very few. It \u2019s within walking distance of the Beach Palace should you wish to go check that out. The pools are heated which was wonderful and they have a heated Jacuzi too. One pool is located beachside and the other Lagoon both have a swim up bar and are equally appealing depending on if you want the sun or not as they both have shade at different times of day. The staff around the pool and the swim up bars are also fantastic a few names that really stood out are Lucinder Laura who provide towels water and Lucinder gives a wonderful cold towel massage. Carlos and Mauricio are also around the pool area and sometimes they work on the beach they are really good guys and will help you with anything. The servers around the pool are extremely attentive they notice when you are near the end of your drink and just bring you another I would like to thank Jeanete Dana Chris Sarahi and new girl Jacqueline who had only just started but she was doing an excellent job. The boys at the swim up bar also did a fantastic job and I would like to thank the Mixologist that is BilyJoel also Humberto and Carlos for looking after us so well. The night entertainment was very good they had singers in they lobby bar early evening or a guy playing the violin and the bar staff were excellent especially Hector and Jorge who incidentally has an incredible singing voice thank you Jorge for serenading myself and my husband on our Anniversary on the Teraza they have the shows and Karoke then a disco afterwards which was pretty good they also have the TVs and a pool table. I would also like to say a big thank you to Isaac the food and beverages manager who we talked to several times and is a very nice humble guy and he is doing an incredible job well done it was a pleasure to meet you and we look forward to seeing you in the future when we return which we most definatley will. At the end of our vacation we are taken back to the airport by another wonderful safe driver Heber. I would highly recommend this Hotel if you enjoy the finer things in life and you want to be pampered and spoiled then this is the place to be.", "offset": [947, 1179], "date": "2020-02-03", "cpt": "1", "category": "room"}, {"id": 18, "uid": "cffaace4-c08f-4653-82b4-a81ee2a487bf", "sentence": "Great food drink but we found the service really strange and will not be back. My boyfriend and I stayed here for my 30th Birthday I had been wanting to stay at Le Blanc since I saw it 10 years ago so this was a big momentThere are lots of positive things about the resort We liked its location right in the Hotel Zone whilst it still felt removed from the hustle bustle and quiet at the same time. You can tell the hotel has been recently renovated as the finish of the rooms and grounds is immaculate. The quality of the food and mostly the drinks the lobby cocktails were hit and miss was really great and far exceeded any other all inclusive I have stayed at. Even the room service was very tasty which is normally a standard below the restaurants at other resorts. We really liked the ap which you could use to order and pre order room service book a restaurant ask for stuff for the room etc. We appreciated the resort credits which gave us an exceptional spa experience for 160 US cash we could have spent as little as 80 for a massage for two and an amazing romantic dinner on the beach for just over 70. This made tours and experiences accessible to us when usually the prices at these resorts are so inflated. And finally on the positives most staff outside of the restaurants were lovely especially our 7th floor butlers Mario and Manuel. BUT the hotel just missed the mark for us. This was the most expensive hotel we have ever stayed in so we were going to measure it against high expectations. We will not be returning for the following reasons The room was just too small for us. Booking the Royal Honeymoon Oceanfront we were expecting a bit more of a wow factor. I knew it would not have a full balcony but the view was more of the pool with a little bit of ocean. I actually have a suspicion now that we were downgraded without telling us. We kept bumping into each other in the room as it was pretty cramped. This is not the reason we will not be back though just worth noting. Our stay did not directly include my Birthday but it was made VERY clear on the booking that the purpose of the stay was my 30th Birthday. I felt disappointed that there was no acknowledgement of my Birthday at all. We were asked to fill out a mid stay review and I said I was upset there was no Birthday celebration. The room was then filled up with balloons and a Happy Birthday sign but it is not the same when you have pretty much had to ask for that to happen. And now the reason we will not be back. The service. do not get me wrong there are lots of really wonderful staff at Le Blanc but the vibe was not for us. The staff are VERY robotic. They have to say it is my pleasure every single time you say thank you. When I made a joke there was an awkward forced laugh and no response. What made my boyfriend really upset was how he was treated. On three separate occasions at three different restaurants he was basically ignored. The worst was in the Italian restaurant where the waiter literally turned his back to him whilst asking me questions about the holiday. I tried to make it as clear as possible how uncomfortable he was making me feel but he did not get the message. He came to top up my wine and ignored my boyfriends glass. We ended up leaving the meal early really upset at the situation. We are not clear if Le Blanc staff have been told to place all attention on the female guests but it was like this albeit not to the extremity of the Italian restaurant in most of the restaurants. I really hope this is the reason and that it is not down to my boyfriends race.", "offset": [399, 503], "date": "2020-02-15", "cpt": "1", "category": "room"}, {"id": 19, "uid": "887d4704-d3d1-4d7c-8c3f-3646229de2c4", "sentence": "Fantastic resort with absolute top notch facilities.
