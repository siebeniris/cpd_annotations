I booked this hotel through Priceline bidding so I clearly got an amazing rate. I was not expecting much due to the reviews here on TripAdvisor. I do not know what hotel these people stayed at but it could not have been this one. I came to check in around 730pm and noticed balconies when we pulled up. I went to the front desk and asked the agent if all rooms came with a balcony and she said no but I can get you in one if you had like. Uh YES PLEASE. Super accommodating Front Desk. I thought we could smoke on the balconies but you can not we walked down to the Courtyard. No bigie. Got to the room and it was very pretty. I love the colors in the room not like other hotels that are flat. Very clean. Checked the shower for hair none. Towels none. Bathroom floor none. Bed none. Very very clean room. Bed was a tad hard for my personal preference but my husband LOVED it. Towels were super soft. The whole hotel was very clean and staff was very accommodating. Security Front Desk Maintenance and the bistro attendant were always greeting you every time you walked by. The only thing that bothered me about this whole hotel were the signs that said renos were coming in Q4 2017.

First the good. The hotel is relatively clean and in a good location within Baton Rouge near the interstate and plenty of shopping and entertainment. The beds are pretty comfortable. I did not try the food. On the other side of things the property is fairly old and its age is showing everywhere you look. It is in need of a deep renovation from top to bottom. The noise from Interstate 10 through these very old windows is probably maddening after an extended stay. do not expect peace and quiet because its very noisy here. The bathtub is tiny and the interior is cracking. The A C unit is ancient loud and basic. The amenity areas seem decent in terms of the bar pool and very small fitness center.

As a businessman I have come to expect a certain level out of Courtyard Mariot. This property fails at almost every level from customer service to the room I stayed in which was disgusting. What kills me is I paid extra as I had to do some late night business and wanted a larger room with a desk. The first thing I noticed is the chair at the desk is completely falling apart. As I did not have a lot of time for changing rooms I toughed it out. The next morning was no better the bathroom was atrocious. The water pressure non existent out of the shower and the shower and associated parts were completely falling apart. That morning when I checked out I complained to the front desk stating I would not rent this room to anybody before serious maintenance was performed on the room. The gentleman at the front desk said sorry about that handed me my receipt and that was it.
