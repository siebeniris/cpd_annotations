I visited the FS for the weekend with my girlfriend. We took the train into town rush hour to avoid traffic. It was quite simple. From the airport we took the Blue Line to Clark and Lake exited and from there it was a 5 min cab ride 6 fare to the Four Seasons. The hotel is perfectly located on Delaware between Rush and Michigan Ave. It is a great part of town located about 4 blocks from Tavern on Rush Gibsons Lux Bar and North Face Nordstrom Lulu Blomingdales downstairs and lots of shops on Michigan Ave the main shopping street in Chicago. It is off the main street so not load. The hotel has private entrance then up to the 7th floor for the lobby above a retail shopping mall. It has a beautiful lobby lined with amazing art and comfortable seating. The lobby leads into the bar and also their restaurant Allium. The bar was very comfortable and we enjoyed drinks there in the evening. I checked into a executive suite with a great view of the John Hancock building city and lake view. The suite was large with private doors between the sofa bed seating area and the bedroom. It was beautifully decorated and the bed was a signature four seasons comfortable bed with the best linens. The bathroom was large with a tub and shower. We enjoyed the spa pool an jacuzi in the Spa. The spa and fitness center was not large but adequate for our use. The service was the best from arrival to check in to check out. I really enjoyed working with the FS concierge Karen Farmer. She was very informative and assisted with many items of interest. We purchased the Art Institute of Chicago Museum tickets to see Van Gogh special exhibit and display of the 3 bedrooms collection. It was VIP so no lines and also we were able to charge to the room. She made key restaurant reservations and recommendations to make our stay perfect to experience the city and its top restaurants. I was really pleased with my decision to stay at the Four Seasons.

Kristen Klus helped get my whole trip ready and she was also there via email when I had a question. No one in the hotel business is better than her or more helpful. The FS is lucky to have her. Our room was on the 46th floor this time and had more of a lake view than a city view which my dad liked. When I first arrived there was a small issue with the bedding and a tiny stain of what looked like makeup on the pillow. That was quickly corrected while I went out to lunch. When I arrived back they had left me the most awesome dessert tray and the Housekeeping manager brought another. I had so many desserts and treats on this trip I was spoiled. I got the new sleep amenity after seeing it posted on Instagram and it was heavenly. The pastry chefs at the FS are top of the line. Everyone should ask about the sleep amenity. Marcus downstairs was fun and helpful to talk too while we waited for our Lyfts to arrive. I was going to have the ice cream man and the pedicure but unfortunately I got sick my last two days and was unable too. The only issue on this trip that was not the fault of the FS was the neighbors next door. They got into a fight and the lady was very loud. I had to call downstairs one night.

Occupying the 30th \u2013 46th floors of a skyscraper towards the Northern side of Michigan Avenue The Four Seasons Hotel is surrounded by the hustle and bustle of the high end shopping district but manages to offer a quiet enclave for its guests to recharge within. We stayed in a newly renovated one bedroom suite and it is by far the most comfortable suite we have stayed at on the Magnificent Mile. The room \u2019s dimensions were generous and mostly on par with other 5star hotels but the floor plan is much better than any competing suite we have stayed in so it really felt like a much larger accommodation. This room category has a second bathroom with a stand alone shower that as far as I am aware is not offered by any other neighboring hotel for this room category. We were traveling as a family with two children so the extra shower was really a priceless addition. There was a separate wet bar with a brass sink and faucet and a separate fridge exclusively for guest storage. Turn down service is thorough while not being imposing and went down without any hitches each night of occupancy. The staff is unfailingly polite and despite being a decent sized hotel I was often greeted by name a pleasant surprise as it is not something I \u2019ve come to expect of big city hotels. The swimming pool and fitness areas are excellent and we put them to good use between excursions. The biggest plus about the Four Seasons Chicago for us was how incredibly child friendly this hotel was. The check in staff and the concierge paid extra attention to our children and went out of their way to give them toys and puzzles. Once each day a staff member brought complimentary treats up to our room specifically for our daughter. It really felt like home. My only complaint is a very minor one \u2013 the house car is limited in its availability and we were never able to procure it to be fair very few hotels in downtown offer a house car so the hotel is already starting on the positive in this respect. To date we have stayed at almost all of the 5star hotels in Chicago but The Four Seasons really stood out and my wife and I have concluded that our future stays in the Windy City will preferentially be at this wonderful hotel.", "offset": [893, 1003], "date": "2019-10-06", "cpt": "1", "category": "restaurant"}, {"id": 11, "uid": "8d518cbc-065f-4083-a391-b2e9226caf6b", "sentence": "They have high standards.
