The lady I spoke with immediately agreed to move us to a room down the hall and sent someone up to swap the room cards. I am a very light sleeper so do not think most would have a problem with this noise. The room itself was very spacious a beautiful king size bed large flat screen tv mini bar hairdryer ironing board and iron and magazines with info on Warsaw. The room also had coffee and tea making facilities with to go cups provided as well as mugs. The bathroom was a good size with shower over the bath which held its temp and was powerful enough. We had breakfast included which was served in the olive restaurant. Cold meats and cheeses lots of different breads and pastries hot items like potato pancakes polish sausages waffles that you could make yourself and juices were available along with various fish and noodle options. We had a few meals in the Someplace else sports bar where the food quality was very high and really inexpensive. We had cocktails and tried some salad and meat dishes all of which were huge portions and well cooked. Service was excellent.
