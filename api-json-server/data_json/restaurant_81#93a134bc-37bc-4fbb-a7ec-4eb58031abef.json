A purely business hotel I visited Ginger Wakad in the 2nd Week of March for a single nights stay. Located on the Pune Bangalore Highway Ginger at this location is ideal for those who have work in around Hinjewadi Aundh etc. Being alone they provided me a Double Bed AC Room which was extremely comfortable for the night. The added advantage for people visiting at this hotel is the Free WIFI which they provide for whoever is staying at here. The WIFI keeps getting disconnected after sometime switch the WIFI on off for it to resumeI did not have a chance to have breakfast in the morning since I had to leave early so can not comment on it. Overall a good decent stay for people coming to Pune for business.", "offset": [481, 680], "date": "2015-03-20 00:00:00", "cpt": "0", "category": "restaurant"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "2ff9ff6f-04b1-4c52-8164-2aa102577fcc", "sentence": "Budget Hotel for a Short Stay. I was to arrive early morning at Chinchwad and needed a place to to change and freshen up before leaving for business and return at the end of the day and check out to board a bus back. As I was expected to arrive early in the day 730 am and with a standard 12 pm check in time I was not sure if any hotel would accommodate a very early check in but I hoped it would and booked for the night I was arriving. I checked up many hotels and for the reason that it was very near to my point of alighting boarding my bus i preferred it over the other very good budget hotel I had stayed in earlier Keys Hotel. The front desk employees were quite courteous and I was allowed to check in as soon as I arrived at about 8 am. Also the breakfast for that day was covered under the booking even though technically I was eligible for the breakfast the next morning. The room was decent though the connecting door to a joint room had a dysfunctional door latch. The bathroom was not quite up to standards in terms of its cleanliness there were water stains on the faucets and the toilet was not really sparkling. The photos attached will show this. I was expecting a higher standard this being a Tata company. Breakfast options were not extravagant but had sufficient variety and I had no complaints there. Overall I was happy with this stay since it met my purpose.", "offset": [1227, 1323], "date": "2015-04-17 00:00:00", "cpt": "0", "category": "restaurant"}, {"id": 2, "uid": "b1a1391a-5ada-47ab-8468-c4be13ac8173", "sentence": "Food was good service was quick.
