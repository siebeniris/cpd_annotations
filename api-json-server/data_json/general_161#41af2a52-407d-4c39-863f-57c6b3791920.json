Ideal time of the year to visit temperature wise plus egg hunts etc for the little people. Beach is lovely soft white sand with a gently lapping sea in which one can walk out quite a bit. Hotel and staff are great. Room was fine and we got an iron board and iron when required. Young man from Sri Lanka cleaning our room number 301 was so friendly and helpful especially after I had a dicky tummy ahem. Room 301 is tucked away at the end of the building so nice and quiet with a lovely view over the pool and sea. Hotel may be a bit out of Dubai but if you have stayed in Dubai hotels the peace and quite in Jebel Ali is sheer bliss. Regular free bus service offered by the hotel which we used to from Dubai and we found that that was a good service but book in advance. We were on BB as we do not drink much. but there are also HB and AI options available. Daughter went horse riding a short stroll across the car park to the stables which she enjoyed. 9 hole golf course is right there at the hotel and I wish I had taken lessons. Gym is great and is open from 6 which is a big plus ie get it out of the way and chill for the rest of the day. One could also learn to shoot take a seaplane ride or pop out in a boat from the lovely little marina. Eating lunch at Club Joumana seemed like you were not even at the hotel. A large flock of peacocks wander around making erm peacock noises. The big test of a hotel stay is would we return again.

We have just recently returned from this lovely resort. We travel as a family and have had been fortunate enough to experience many 5 all inclusive resorts. Our girls voted this as our best holiday so far all down to the great experience at Jebel Ali. The outstanding feature of this resort is the very tentative efficient and professional staff. From the moment we arrived until we checked out we were extremely well looked after. We had two rooms which were immaculately clean and spacious. The hotel amenities cater for all. Fortunately for us it was not overly busy we were always served very quickly and always got our favourite loungersThe food quality variety and presentation is impressive and the al a carte restaurants food is just divine. There is a theme night in the main restaurants again the food was faultless and we thoroughly enjoyed the variety and presentation. The alcoholic drinks are of a good standard with well known brands offered. Complimentary water sports camel ride etc. all added to the experience. We made a point of using all the facilities and enjoyed all the bars and restaurants even the gymnasiumWe were on first name terms with the very friendly too many to mention and would be afraid to miss anyone out everyone member of staff we encountered was fantastic. well doneThe Mushref Bar has a great vibe and we became regulars the singer Ralitsa is absolutely amazing. The only one minor point to mention is at first we found the all inclusive description a little confusing however we got accustomed to it the signing of every receipt was also a new concept to us as we have not required to do this at other resorts just a small observation. We certainly look forward to our next tripThanks again and keep up the superb standards.", "offset": [359, 443], "date": "2015-08-18", "cpt": "0", "category": "general"}, {"id": 2, "uid": "53223728-7d02-400e-a8b0-51f83dfdb27c", "sentence": "Great place to relax.

At the time of booking I specifically asked for a room NOT on the 1st floor as I dislike the lack of privacy and security provided by the common balcony shared with all of the other 1st floor rooms. On arrival I was given a 1st floor room. I spoke to the receptionist and told her that I had specifically requested that we were NOT put on the 1st floor. She replied that the room that I had booked was the 1st floor room. I again told her that I had spoken directly with your Reservations team clearly requesting that we were NOT allocated a 1st floor room but YOUR Reservations team had made the booking not me. She continued to insist that I had made the booking for that specific room which annoyed me greatly. As I appeared to be talking to someone who was not willing to listen to my complaint or compromise to accommodate the error I took the room under protest. The problems continued at the restaurant. We had been told that the restaurant had been changed from an Italian to a Lebanese which is OK we like Lebanese food. However the trend of not listening continued. We ordered sparkling water and were served still water. We then told the first waitress that we were not ready to order and that we would call her when we were ready. We were then approached several times over the next few minutes by different servers asking if we were ready to order. What is this. Fast Food. When I go for a meal with my wife we like to take our time. We appreciate attentive staff but intrusive staff annoy us. The food was so so. We eat Lebanese food regularly and appreciate good Humus Sujuk done in pomegranate syrup until they are tender but still with bite Chicken livers in a tangy gravy of garlic and lemon.
