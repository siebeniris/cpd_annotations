Everyone from our waitress at the pool the doormen front desk and housekeeping were great. We were really impressed with the overall cleanliness and upkeep of our room Tresor Tower hotel interior and grounds. We came with our three year old daughter and were a little nervous about how kid friendly the hotel would be. We were pleasantly surprised. The kids pool was wonderful. It was nice to have a place where we did not have to worry about annoying anyone and there were plenty of playmates for her there. We still went in the other pools with her but mostly hung out in the kids area. During our stay we ate at Chez Bon Bon everyday for breakfast I loved the yogurt parfait and my husband liked the quiche. The desserts there were also delicious. At the pool the kids meals were convenient for our daughter and we liked the Cubano sandwich. Drinks were expensive but delicious and strong. The only critique I have is that the life guards at the kids pool were a joke. They spent more time chatting it up with each other and looking at their phones than actually paying attention.", "offset": [186, 303], "date": "2015-03-09", "cpt": "0", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "f6430daa-e003-491e-8057-42644cd6a751", "sentence": "Beautiful but needs to improve on service. Went for a long weekend with my bestie. We were so excited upon arriving having read all the good reviews and some negative ones. When we got dropped off at the 41 entrance there were two check in counters outside. There was only two parties in front of us. After waiting ten mins the girl told us there are check in counters on either side of the building so we left and went inside. BIG MISTaKE. Check in took almost 40 minutes. Marcia who checked us in did not crack a smile for the entire time but repeatedly said I DO apologize for the long wait. Everyone seemed like they were waiting a long time. It took us about 10 mins to get to the counter and the rest of it was actually waiting for a room to be confirmed for us. Finally she gave us another room no upgrade or anything to make up for our ridiculously long check in. Got to the room and bathroom floor was dirty and handle missing off faucet. Is this what 300 per night gets you. Maintenance got sent up and we got in touch with a manager Matt who was really nice and apologetic about the whole thing but regardless our trip did not get off to a great start. He eventually offered some things to help make up for the inconvenience which was nice of him. Overall most of the staff working on the beach and the pool were really nice except for tall and skinny dark guy at the pool who was really rude. He actually smarted off to us when all we asked was for him to help us find two chairs in the shade. Service is not that quick. Bartenders seem to have an attitude. I also did not like that 18 gratuity was added automatically because there were times when the service did not deserve that amount of tip. The actual hotel staff like at the restaurant and lobby were nothing spectacular. We never really felt really welcomed but more like ok you paid to be here so I guess we have to be nice to you. For this amount of money an all inclusive in cancun is much better in terms of service. Drinks were pretty good but some drinks were served with stolin vodka. Really. For 16. Beer was priced reasonably. Other pros hotel smelt really god like bublegum. And overall the grounds were extremely clean. Rooms were beautiful. Bed super comfy. Michael Mina 74 and Hakasan was so good. So was le cote and beach side dining. Vidas french toast is to die for. The pool area also had unlimited fruit infused water which was really great. Beach servers were friendly Edwin and Claudia and curly hair guy. Peter left us alone a lot but that may be a confusion of servers. On Monday late morning we waited 15 minutes before anyone even came to us. Come prepared to spend money and you will have a great time. Beware of large amounts of people in a pol you will always get people who have no sense of common etiquete bodily wise. Chair saving is tricky to 45 min rule or they kick you out. Lobby turns pretty rowdy after ten so beware if you have little kids. I would go back for the beach and the pool but might actually prefer a smaller resort with less people. I think for the price and all the ridiculous extra charges like 25 for an umbrella at the beach 2195 resort fee for chairs at the beach and wifi the service can be MUCH improved. Because it is so expensive I would give it three stars. Since we still had a great time I will give this 4 stars since half stars are not allowed. Overall the resort has it al great restaurants beautiful grounds and pools and great beach atmosphere pretty quiet. Now they just need to focus on the service. It has to be consistent among ALL the staff because it just takes one bad employee to ruin everything.

The location is awesome right on the waterway where large yachts park on one side and the ocean on the other. The staff were friendly and attentive.

Beach also looked very inviting. Cost is not bad for the rooms shopping is nominal though and the restaurants are pricey.

This was a beyond terrible experience. For a luxury hotel as guest you felt like a cog in the machine of the Fountainbleau. I stayed in one of their junior suites which upon check in as a single woman the hostesses was almost surprised that I had selected that room. It was a deeming experience and once I got to my lovely room which did have a beautiful view of the ocean and a balcony. my neighbors for the weekend we are TWELVE guys in ONE room celebrating a bachelor party. it is Miami but this was not my definition of a premium experience. Security at the pool was amazingly robust even in a hotel robe you needed your room key to go anywhere but not on the elevator to the actual rooms where there was a sign saying room key required but it did not actually work. I tried several of the restaurants on site the food was average at best and several times my orders came back incorrectly. Fountainbleau is an incredibly mediocre experience with a very expensive price tag. I would NEVER recommend this hotel to anyone. If you are looking here go somewhere else. STAY AWAYUPDATE as of 25191. I reached out to customer service BEFORE my arrival via email asking about my room rate details and asking for a early check in. I NEVER got a response back to my email nor was it mentioned at check in. 2. I completed the fountainbleau provided survey on my stay after my stay. I NEVER got a response back to my survey which was full of negative feedback and in fact they asked me to fill out the same survey the following day. 3. I provided a negative TripAdvisor review of the Fountainbleau and management messaged me a day after my review privately and asked for my contact information which I provided within a few hours. It has been FIVE days since that exchange and fountainbleau management has NEVER responded or reached out to me again via Trip Advisor email or phone. They were however clear to post publicly to my Trip Advisor review two days ago asking for me to send my information which I had already done days earlier to clearly just pacify their social persona. I have no idea how this hotel has ANY positive reviews. The service is TERRIBLE and mediocre is the only word to describe it.

The only grace being the unobstructed view of the ocean for which we paid dearly. To be truthful the bathroom was fine as well. The mattress was uncomfortable. The old mini fridge was noisy and the ice maker broken. There was not one USB port and EC outlets are located in awkward places. The doors close loudly and the neighboring guest kept us up at night. But our biggest disappointment was the outside area the fact that everything outside closes at dusk left me speechless. You can not use the swimming or whirlpool after 6PM. You can not eat or drink outside after 6PM. there is nothing to do on the vast outside premises between dusk and down but sit on the fake grass and marvel why one would want to spend any kind of money on this place. The restaurants there serve bad to mediocre food at exorbitant prices. The spa service has an aggressive desk staff and an average service and of course it is overpriced even for the resort. And yes they are charging 25 bucks for a beach umbrella and that is a nickel and dime pettiness unbecoming of the 5 start resort.

This is my second year in a row spending a week in Miami Beach in June. Last year I stayed next door at the Eden Roc so I wanted to write a comparative review in case others are interested in knowing the differences. Since these hotels are right next to each other I think it \u2019s worth it to really dig into both experiences. First of all I am more of a budget traveler. I am decently middle class so if you have got a ton of money and do not care about dropping a lot of it on a bunch of stuff then you might have a different experience. PROSTroly. The free troly stops right outside the Fontainebleau there is a northward stop right by the entrance to the Sorento and Tresor entrances which I loved because there is not a northward troly stop in front of the Eden Roc and the extra walk can be terrible if it is super hot and you are already tired. Southward there are a multitude of stops to choose from for the Collins Express which is the main line you take to Lincoln Rd. Overall I preferred the troly stops for the Fontainebleau. Room View I originally booked an ocean view balcony room in the Chateau Tower the main curved building but upon check in we were informed that we were moved to the Sorento Tower top floor to a junior suite so we were definitely upgraded there was a small kitchen with a real empty fridge w ice maker microwave silverware and a sink in addition to the mini bar. we could use which was awesome b c at the Eden Roc you pay extra if you want a fridge that is not full of mini bar stuff. some nights we had leftovers and it was nice to have a place to keep and reheat them. There was also a bathtub in our room which was not included in the original room I booked. Last year I stayed in the Ocean View Junior Suite at the Eden Roc it had a bathtub as wel I prefer the Eden Rocs bed and layout of the suite but the view from the Fontainebleau was a lot better so this is honestly a toss up. The Sorento Tower also has a private pool on the 5th floor just for people in the Sorento building you need a room key to access and that was a MAJOR pro for me. Overall I preferred the Fontainebleau \u2019s room but only because we were upgraded. If you do n\u2019t mind having a partial ocean view I \u2019d recommend the Eden Roc because the bed is so much more comfortable. Beach Since they are right next to each other the beach is the same. At both hotels sunbeds are included for each registered hotel guest but the umbrellas are extra. At the Fontainebleau the umbrellas are 25 day. I remember the Eden Roc \u2019s were a little more expensive last year. Service is pretty much equal at both. It \u2019s a toss up. Staff. The staff at the Fontainebleau can range from extremely friendly to basically ignoring you. Because it \u2019s such a large hotel this is expected. There were a few staff that were great except at the pool. Eden Rocs staff were similar. Honestly this is a toss up between the two hotels. They rank basically the same in my view. CONSRestaurants. At both hotels I have read reviews about how good the food is. I \u2019ve eaten at Nobu Malibu Farm and off the beach menu at the Eden Roc and La Cote and Pizza and Burger at the Fontainebleau. Besides Nobu I really would n\u2019t recommend eating at any of these restaurants. Maybe I have bougie tastes or something but we spent 100 at Pizza and Burger \u2026 for like plain burgers. They are n\u2019t anything special. Save your money take the troly to Lincoln Road or South Beach and eat at Pizza Bar Time Out Market Bodega Shake Shack Yardbird or La Sandwicherie. Trust me way less expensive and such better food. If you feel like a nice uber ride go to KYU in Wynewod. Best meal I had all week hands down. Also makes a great date night. Go to Lagniappe after for wine. Pools. Honestly yes the Fontainebleau has prettier looking pools. But they are crowded AF the water is super warm hotter than bathwater not refreshing in the summer heat I guess they are heated. and the service is terrible it \u2019s nearly impossible to find a decent spot and even harder to find an attendant. I prefer the service at the Eden Roc yes it \u2019s much smaller but it \u2019s not nearly as crowded the water is actually cool and the personal attention you get is so so so much better. I guess I prefer a calm pool seting that \u2019s a personal taste. If you prefer crowded and loud go for the Fontainebleau. Funnily enough the Arkadia over 21 pool is the most calm during the wekdays go there for respite or stay in the Sorento and access the 5th floor pool. Those two places salvaged the experience for me. Overall Eden Roc wins this one hands down. Check Out Bag Storage. Eden Roc is very chill regarding late checkout and they basically offered it to us upon check in we got a 1 pm time and baggage storage was great. We left our key cards in the room went down to the lobby and took our bags to the storage area. It was super simple. At the Fontainebleau you have to call after 7 am on the day you \u2019re checking out to get late checkout. I did around 745am and was only able to get an extra hour noon. I \u2019d recommend everyone do this because the checkout scenario during the weekday is horrendous. I guess on weekends they post mobile checkout stands but they do not do this on the weekdays and you have to wait in line. However they charge extra if you do n\u2019t check out by your set time and apparently this happens to a lot of people. I \u2019d recommend checking out at the Sorento or Tresor desks and not at the main one \u2026 a lot less of a wait. Eden Roc wins this one for me. Incidental Charges This is my biggest complaint and the starkest difference between the two hotels. Now I get that the Fontainebleau is a bigger resort but MY GOD they require 150 a night so for example you \u2019re staying 5 nights x 150 70 hold. You have to put that hold on your card and when you charge things to the room you are charged ON TOP of that amount. At the Eden Roc I put down 300 for the whole week and when I charged things to the room it was charged against the hold so let \u2019s say I spend 280 the whole wek after checkout I got 20 refunded from that initial 300 hold. Now at both hotels we paid in full for the room beforehand \u2026. so I find the Fontainebleau hold outrageous. Maybe they are used to people destroying the rooms or something but I and a few other guests I spoke with found that just over the top. Not everyone can just casually put 70 down and then pay hotel charges on top. It \u2019s been 3 days and I \u2019m still waiting for the hold to be released. This is very upsetting to me and probably the reason I wo n\u2019t return to the Fontainebleau. Overall if you want to see what the Fontainebleau is like go for it but I \u2019d recommend a couple of days max. If you prefer a calmer but equally luxurious experience and plan to stay for more than 3 days go to the Eden Roc you will not be missing out on anything.", "offset": [3839, 3967], "date": "2019-06-29", "cpt": "1", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 17, "uid": "abffc37e-9e8f-41c4-8c77-dfe37523ece0", "sentence": "Good not GREAT.

Huge room. Comfortable bed. Good water pressure. Large bathroom. Private heated pool and hot tub were a great place to wind down after the main pool scene. Main pool scene. Wonderful Miami party scene with less pretension than others I have seen. You do have to get up early to claim your pool seats but renting beds and cabanas is not a necessity here. The music starts to get loud at 11 and the party starts at 1. Full on party at Cote which begins to spill out to the main area. But you can always find a calm space if you prefer the pool and lounge section covers a massive area. We ate at Vida Burger Pizza and Hakasan. All were wonderful. I think Hakasan is a little overhyped but still very good. It is a huge complex and things do take some time 10 20 minutes for your car up to an hour for your bags to reach your room. But everything is done with such grace that it just does not matter. All over the property you hear polite and gracious interactions with the staff. even to the most obnoxious of guests. I can say without a doubt I would return to Fontainebleau over and over before going anywhere else.", "offset": [20, 143], "date": "2020-02-27", "cpt": "1", "category": "renovation"}]}
