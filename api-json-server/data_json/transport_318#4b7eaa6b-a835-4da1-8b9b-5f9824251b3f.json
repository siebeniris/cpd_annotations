Unfortunately this trip was truly disappointing as we were placed in a room in very close proximity to where construction work was being done.

To our dismay during check in we were not made aware that the hotel was undergoing construction which is totally understandable however not being informed of the circumstances or allowed to choose a different room location was definitely not up to the gold standards we count on when booking hotel reservations in Vegas.

Upon returning to our room we found the pillows strewn about the floor. Eew. So we asked for new ones. Waited again and this time they only gave us 2 pillows because we had reached the maximum pillow allotment even though we were returning 4. After that the service got worse and worse. Housekeeping was rude the guest service manager said they did n\u2019t guarantee good service and the front desk manager just did n\u2019t care. This was an easily remedied situation that was never resolved. Also keep in mind that only some of the rooms are renovated. The property itself is very dirty and dingy. Dirty paint carpet dark low ceilings. It \u2019s old Vegas not luxury like some of the newer hotels. Lastly the pool area is pretty gross. After only a few hours of the pool being open it looks like a murky cesspool. There just are n\u2019t enough facilities for the amount of people. The decking was all muddy or just sludge covered the whole things making it a safety hazard. There were beverage and alcohol containers thrown about.

However our neighbors decided to host their own personal dance party at 4 in the morning our first night. We called security to no real result. Needless to say the music continued late into the morning. Thankfully when we checked in the clerk explained that we could switch rooms if we wanted. We originally booked a room with a king size bed. When we arrived they only had a room with two queen beds available. I am not sure they would have had another bed available in a different situation and they did interrogate us as to why we wanted to switch rooms when we asked. In the end we were put in a much cozier room and slept much better. The Flamingo is centrally located on the Strip and it is rather easy to get to any of the other neighboring casinos and restaurants. There is also a CVS a block away and a much cheaper. ABC Mart located within the Miracle MIle Mall about two blocks away. There are at least two pools on the property and both were PACKED the whole time we were there. The Go Pool is basically a club with water which was kind of obnoxious at first but we ended up making friends and enjoyed the people watching. Kids are only allowed at the family pool. Dining options are available but not suggested. The main buffet and restaurant the Paradise Garden Buffet is atrocious and all the quick bites are very expensive. we are talking close to nine dollars for a slice of pizza or ten dollars for a hoagie. I guess in general food does not come cheap in Vegas but it seemed almost excessive here. There are better options within walking distance including an In N Out Burger right behind. All in all for the price point location and quality of the room I would probably stay here again.

I check in via the kiosk where they offered 10 back to skip room cleaning. I was only there for two nights so that was fine. I booked the hotel with 4 people on the reservation. yet I only had 2 towels. when I asked for more they said I opted out of that service. Are you kidding me. At least 1 towel a person should be minimum for 4 people staying. I asked them to print off my tickets for a show because I need a copy before I could get the real tickets. their response. Go to fedex if you want that done. So back to the 10 voucher I could n\u2019t use for purchasing because they had to verify it was me through the receptionist even though they had my ID In addition to this bull They do n\u2019t offer shuttles it is awkward to walk from rooms to the strip not the best situation for handicap travelers.

As a regular visitor of Las Vegas I try to stay in a different hotel each time and based on location selected Flamingo at the end of November. Upon arrival tried to use the kiosk check in but it would not work so had to join a lengthy check in queue and stand for 40 minutes as they only had a few staff members on. Once checking in we enquired if our 3 rooms we had booked as a group could be changed to non smoking as our travel agent had not given us a choice only to be told that just one could be changed and the others could be changed the next day if we still wanted too. I have chest problems but we were also travelling with an Autistic Adult so I let them have the non smoking room. Upon exiting the elevator a cloud of smoke hit us which was over powering. We found our room was also so smoke filled I did not bother unpacking and spent the night using bedshets which stank of smoke chest was ruined the next day. The next morning we went down to enquire about changing and joined another large slow moving queue. We stated to the male member of staff that we needed to change rooms as i had chest problems which he said was fine after asking why I wanted to change and swiftly changed us allowing us to go collect our bags. Once at the non smoking room we opened the door to a complete tip an unmade untidied room which had just been checked out of I am talking towels everywhere over filled bins and unmade beds. In the stress of it i also realised i had left my backpack in the previous room so had to go back to reception to request access to the other room which they were not great about and demanded the person who is name was on the booking to also be present. Got my backpack in the end however maids were already in the room and the backpack was opened but thankfully nothing was taken they said they were bringing it to lost and found. Third trip to reception where I met a lovely older gentleman called Denis who was shocked we had been given an untided room he sorted us out with a fabulous room with a view of the High Roller. He also gave us a map and offered suggestions for shows and restaurants give that man a raise he saved the day. The location of the hotel is fantastic in the centre of everything and the wildlife habitat with the Flamingos and Pelicans is beautiful. The casino is also good with quick waitress service. We had breakfast included in our package which involved 18 per room that could only be used at the take away place. just okay not amazing. Definitely recommend checking out the Linq promenade located at the side of Flamingo it has lots of restaurants bars and a zipline. Yes the time share people are at the elevators but when they found out I ignored them or politely said no straight away they stopped pestering. However one issue with the rooms I noticed is that the walls were paper thin especially in the bathroom and each morning around 4 or 5 a man next door emptied the contents of his stomach which was not particularly nice to listen to and I am pretty sure he was one step away from alcohol poisoning. A bit disappointed with Flamingo as I love the hotel and always spend time in its facilities each year but to stay was not amazing even with the new rooms only good thing is the location so doubt i will stay again but will still come back to use the facilities such as the casino.", "offset": [19, 161], "date": "2018-12-04 00:00:00", "cpt": "1", "category": "transport"}, {"id": 17, "uid": "1221e222-54f8-4f59-9d82-b673d4daf0b3", "sentence": "Good.
