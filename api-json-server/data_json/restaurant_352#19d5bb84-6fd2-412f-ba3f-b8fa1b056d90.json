Good stay. If you do your research first before booking at SLS then you should not have any surprises once you arrive. Took a taxi from the airport to SLS 19 or so. Upon arrival Saturday at 330pm we were greeted with a nice front desk clerk and check in was a breeze. We stayed in the World Tower on the 27th floor. Per the reviews pictures posted by others on Trip Advisor the room was a little small. But not over the top small. We had a King size bed and couch at the foot of the bed. there was enough room to move around freely for the 2 of us. Large mirrors on both sides of the room that were lit. We did not touch the fridge with liquor or snacks because there is a charge. Stop at the Walgrens close proximity and grab some drink snacks. The hotel has a casino and smoking is allowed. Perq is good for morning coffee. Northside is good for breakfast lunch dinner. Or just walk down 1 block and go to IHop. Hotel was clean and modern. Not a fan of the hotel themes but who cares. you are not living there. I am sure you did not come to Vegas for the hotel d\u00e9cor. All the staff at the hotel were friendly and spoke. The Ice machines are located on each floor. The monorail is in the rear of the hotel with easy access. SLS is the last stop and its a quick ride to get to the main part of the strip. Train comes every 8 minutes. Bring your comfy walking shoes. Stop at the monorail booth to get 2day passes for 23 or a 1day pass is 13 at the self serve machine. Uber or Lyft pick up is the main entrance of SLS. You can walk to Circus Circus or the Stratosphere from SLS as well. Once again bring your walking shoes. The pool area looked nice although we did not use it. All in all we had a good solid stay at SLS. Checkout was a breeze and we departed on a Tuesday morning around 5AM. We found NO extra charges on the bill when we checked out. Except for the resort fees which was 3628 per day including tax. If you want a nice hotel stay because you came to Vegas to gamble and explore then SLS is a good fit.

Having been to Vegas a few times before staying in the MGM Grand a couple of times and the Mirage we decided to go for something on the cheaper end of the scale this time but still with the convenience of being on the monorail so we were not too disconnected from the strip. In the past we had always been to Vegas as a couple but this time we went as a family with a 7 month old baby. The hotel is very family friendly. We went for 2 weeks this time. Pool Very family friendly but great for couples too. Live DJ plays at the Foxtail pool on a Friday Sunday and if you look up the Foxtail pool you will find it is one of the best in Vegas. The only issue is if you want a parasol umbrella there are only a few and you have to be at the pool when it opens at 9AM to grab one else you will have to do without. They have cabanas and day beds for rental too. Casino Very modern and up to date. Not as big as most strip hotels but has everything you would need.

This made the room very dark and made me feel like i was in a basement. However i got past this as it was ibly somewhere to shower and rest our heads.

As regular visitors and members of club 52 they provide incentives with 2 nights comped each month to which we usually add a third night paid that is still very reasonable as well as 30 dollars in free dining credits and 20 in free slot play. We first discovered it when it was the SLS back in 2015 as my wife found a very cheap room there on Priceline. We made three trips to Vegas this year to stay here in January August and November 2019. The hotel has been under renovation for re branding back to the Sahara name in September so in January half the Casino was closed including the original bar and in August they had completed the Casino renovation but had moved the check in desk to the front of the hotel while the lobby in back was being renovated. Most work was complete by our return during Thanksgiving week in November. A minor inconvenience at worst. Things we really like about this hotel1. it is the last stop on the LV monorail and you can buy unlimited ride tickets online for 3 days for about 27 each. We use the monorail to go up and down the strip it runs all the way south to MGM to visit other casinos and see shows2. The comps are certainly an incentive to return. we have also found the reservation staff on the phone and the check in staff at the desk very helpful3. On our last two stays we were able to check in early which is very helpful because we take the first available flight on Southwest which gets us to Vegas at about 7 AM. In August they charged us a 20 early check in fee which we were happy to pay and in November they did not charge us at all. it is nice to drop your bags and freshen up in your room before you head out to to all things Vegas4. The renovated casino lobby and CASBAR are all quite beautiful and add a touch of elegance to the hotel. The marble in the lobby looks similar to that in the Wyn hotel. 5. they have closed a couple of restaurants and added others. 80 degrees pizza and Katsuya Sushi are no longer there. Bazaar Meat Umami burger and Northside cafe remain joined with a Mexican Street Foods restaurant. 6. The rooms are generally quiet especially on the upper floors clean and big enough for the two of us we stay in the World Tower which is the mid level price range. Areas for improvement1. As many have noted the WIFI was is and seemingly always will be terrible. No matter which room we stay in we can barely get two bars of signal and it drops frequently. This is a bit of a pain as my wife likes to do work on her laptop in the morning before we head out for the day and I can not connect at all with my Kindle.

While our wait for an UBER is typically less than 5 minutes they moved the ride share pickup site to the 4th floor of one of the parking garages for some reason. Many drivers are still not aware of this necessitating a call while waiting for a pickup. They still drop you off in front of the hotel when arriving. Not sure why the pickup point was changed as there is certainly enough room for taxis and Ubers to share the space out front for pickup and drop of3. Bring your own pillows. The ones supplied by the hotel are lumpy and misshapen and not very comfortable. The King beds we stay in are however very comfortable with the right combination of softness firmnes4. We do not even LOOK at the minibar for fear of being charged for something. The pricing is absurd. 5. The Casino has a good selection of table games and slot machines which we play and even when busy is fairly quiet unles there is a hot shooter on one of the Craps tables. We play the Monopoly and several other penny machines and spend most of our money on the Wheel of Fortune slots. We play the quarter and dollar machines for the most part which seem to have gotten tighter and tighter over the last several years. Not having a lot of luck on the most recent trip I decided to try my luck in the newly constructed high limit slot rooms on the 5 wheel of fortune machine. I was fortunate enough to hit a 6 K Jackpot and hit the service button since a hand payout was required. I sat there for 10 minutes and no attendant came by. I finally called my wife who came down from our room 10 minutes later and still no attendant. She finally found someone on the floor who came over looked at the machine and immediately announced she had to call her manager. 10 minutes later the manager came by and then it was another 15 minutes for them to cut a check and create a W2 G for the tax payout. If you want to incentivize people to use the high limit room I was the only one in there you had best post an attendant there full time. I know first world problems right6. Cocktail service on the floor can be hit or miss. We always tip our server generously with each round but that does not always improve the service. Fod1. Bazaar meat is spectacular. We had 9 course tasting menus the last two visits that were only 95 per person and had them paired with 3 wines. The food the wine and the service made for a great time. If you want a dining EXPERIENCE this is the place to go2. Umami burger is way overrated. Seriously. They must use frozen patties the food is generally warm at best and they struggle every time we ask them to bring mustard instead of ketchup for the burger. Good selection of beer though. 3. Northside cafe has a large menu and the food is surprisingly good whether you go with the Chinese options or the typical diner fare. it is always tasty fresh and HOT temperature wise4. We ate once at the Mexican street foods place. We sat at the bar and still did not get the best service. The food was good but disappointed they only had bottled or canned beer with nothing on tap. 5. They opened a new Starbucks outlet in the lobby which is a typical outlet for them and always busy6. We have not eaten at Bela Bistro or at the outdoor Beers and Bets beer garden. Overall we really enjoy staying at the Sahara. When the new Resortsworld hotel and the Drew the old Fountain Bleu project are completed and depending on what the new owner does with Circus Circus the North End of the Strip is going to give the South and mid strip areas a run for their money. The Sahara is targeting a different demographic moving away from the Milenials and other young folks and looking after people like us DINKS in their late 40s. early 50s. If that is you I had highly recommend it. If you want to party 247 you are better off further South on the Strip.", "offset": [2472, 2565], "date": "2019-12-11", "cpt": "2", "category": "restaurant"}, {"id": 21, "uid": "fd886a6b-af60-4b8a-822b-7a51832ee1b6", "sentence": "We always enjoy our stay here. we have been staying at the Sahara for several years now when we travel to Vegas from San Antonio Texas.

The Casino has a good selection of table games and slot machines which we play and even when busy is fairly quiet unles there is a hot shooter on one of the Craps tables. We play the Monopoly and several other penny machines and spend most of our money on the Wheel of Fortune slots. We play the quarter and dollar machines for the most part which seem to have gotten tighter and tighter over the last several years. Not having a lot of luck on the most recent trip I decided to try my luck in the newly constructed high limit slot rooms on the 5 wheel of fortune machine. I was fortunate enough to hit a 6 K Jackpot and hit the service button since a hand payout was required. I sat there for 10 minutes and no attendant came by. I finally called my wife who came down from our room 10 minutes later and still no attendant. She finally found someone on the floor who came over looked at the machine and immediately announced she had to call her manager. 10 minutes later the manager came by and then it was another 15 minutes for them to cut a check and create a W2 G for the tax payout. If you want to incentivize people to use the high limit room I was the only one in there you had best post an attendant there full time. I know first world problems right6. Cocktail service on the floor can be hit or miss. We always tip our server generously with each round but that does not always improve the service. Fod1. Bazaar meat is spectacular. We had 9 course tasting menus the last two visits that were only 95 per person and had them paired with 3 wines. The food the wine and the service made for a great time. If you want a dining EXPERIENCE this is the place to go2. Umami burger is way overrated. Seriously. They must use frozen patties the food is generally warm at best and they struggle every time we ask them to bring mustard instead of ketchup for the burger. Good selection of beer though. 3. Northside cafe has a large menu and the food is surprisingly good whether you go with the Chinese options or the typical diner fare. it is always tasty fresh and HOT temperature wise4. We ate once at the Mexican street foods place. We sat at the bar and still did not get the best service. The food was good but disappointed they only had bottled or canned beer with nothing on tap. 5. They opened a new Starbucks outlet in the lobby which is a typical outlet for them and always busy6. We have not eaten at Bela Bistro or at the outdoor Beers and Bets beer garden. Overall we really enjoy staying at the Sahara. When the new Resortsworld hotel and the Drew the old Fountain Bleu project are completed and depending on what the new owner does with Circus Circus the North End of the Strip is going to give the South and mid strip areas a run for their money. The Sahara is targeting a different demographic moving away from the Milenials and other young folks and looking after people like us DINKS in their late 40s. early 50s. If that is you I had highly recommend it. If you want to party 247 you are better off further South on the Strip.", "offset": [579, 893], "date": "2019-12-11", "cpt": "2", "category": "restaurant"}, {"id": 22, "uid": "fd886a6b-af60-4b8a-822b-7a51832ee1b6", "sentence": "We always enjoy our stay here. we have been staying at the Sahara for several years now when we travel to Vegas from San Antonio Texas. As regular visitors and members of club 52 they provide incentives with 2 nights comped each month to which we usually add a third night paid that is still very reasonable as well as 30 dollars in free dining credits and 20 in free slot play. We first discovered it when it was the SLS back in 2015 as my wife found a very cheap room there on Priceline. We made three trips to Vegas this year to stay here in January August and November 2019. The hotel has been under renovation for re branding back to the Sahara name in September so in January half the Casino was closed including the original bar and in August they had completed the Casino renovation but had moved the check in desk to the front of the hotel while the lobby in back was being renovated. Most work was complete by our return during Thanksgiving week in November. A minor inconvenience at worst. Things we really like about this hotel1. it is the last stop on the LV monorail and you can buy unlimited ride tickets online for 3 days for about 27 each. We use the monorail to go up and down the strip it runs all the way south to MGM to visit other casinos and see shows2. The comps are certainly an incentive to return. we have also found the reservation staff on the phone and the check in staff at the desk very helpful3. On our last two stays we were able to check in early which is very helpful because we take the first available flight on Southwest which gets us to Vegas at about 7 AM. In August they charged us a 20 early check in fee which we were happy to pay and in November they did not charge us at all. it is nice to drop your bags and freshen up in your room before you head out to to all things Vegas4. The renovated casino lobby and CASBAR are all quite beautiful and add a touch of elegance to the hotel. The marble in the lobby looks similar to that in the Wyn hotel. 5. they have closed a couple of restaurants and added others. 80 degrees pizza and Katsuya Sushi are no longer there. Bazaar Meat Umami burger and Northside cafe remain joined with a Mexican Street Foods restaurant. 6. The rooms are generally quiet especially on the upper floors clean and big enough for the two of us we stay in the World Tower which is the mid level price range. Areas for improvement1. As many have noted the WIFI was is and seemingly always will be terrible. No matter which room we stay in we can barely get two bars of signal and it drops frequently. This is a bit of a pain as my wife likes to do work on her laptop in the morning before we head out for the day and I can not connect at all with my Kindle. Considering the resort fee is 43 per night this is unacceptable. 2. While our wait for an UBER is typically less than 5 minutes they moved the ride share pickup site to the 4th floor of one of the parking garages for some reason. Many drivers are still not aware of this necessitating a call while waiting for a pickup. They still drop you off in front of the hotel when arriving. Not sure why the pickup point was changed as there is certainly enough room for taxis and Ubers to share the space out front for pickup and drop of3. Bring your own pillows.

The lack of informational binder you know the binder that tells you information of what services are offered in the hotel room service hours restaurants breakfast options etc. There was a room service menu in the room. It was minimal in information. For INSTANCE you need to ask room service for a rolling table this is not listed on the menu in small print. However the 18 gratuity is. Know what else is not listed on the menu as need to know information nor is it passed on by the room service staff if you want your room service on actual plates china you need to ask. Again something that would probably be in the hotel informational binder. I may or may not stay at this property again.

The safe hidden inside a drawer under the honor bar so we did not find it until the last day. The Mara tower rooms also have these awful shades over the window that is printed with a photo of about 1000 white dudes at a concert.
