Upon arrival to the welcome desk you are given a yummy rum punch cocktail and are then taken by boat to the island which is exciting to see the dolphins swimming along as you boat across.

The rooms are large and nicely decorated. There are Key Deer that reside on the island that are very friendly and make for some neat photos. There really is not any beach other than by the restaurant but they have lovely docks that have loungers facing the water for your relaxation. The food is good but not outstanding. They have a nice wine list though we had some special bottles we brought along that we would open each day and bring over to the fire pit to sit and share making the evenings very romantic and relaxing. The down side of our stay was the spa. The spa is VERY expensive and you would expect for the price would be luxurious. Sadly the attendants do not really put any effort into he services and really just phone in the technique. We were hugely disappointed in the spa services.

The rooms little huts are perfect. Islandy super clean and air conditioned. We went with the all inclusive price and were not disapointed.

Little Palm Island resort offers a level of relaxation bar none and amenities you will not believe. Exclusivity has its cost and the resort is pricey but delivers a level of service and accommodations second to none. Only 15 very private bungalows insure amazing privacy and comfort. Most have private decks hot tubs hammocks and fantastic rooms. The food is simply amazing and is delivered anywhere you wish whether in room by the pool in the main dining room or on the beach. The service is exceptional but reflects the relaxed atmosphere of the Florida Keys. You truly feels like you are somewhere on a private island in the caribeans. The spa is fabulous and many watersports are also available. No TVs makes for a secluded paradise where unplugging means exactly that. We loved itYou simply valet your car upon arrival and forget it all. The boat takes you right to the island where you are greeted by Renda who is so welcoming and the bliss begins.

Little Palm Island is an exceptional place to stay with a great location outstanding service a range of fun activities and a splendid sense of seclusion with a price tag to match. Depending on your interests and taste it may not be perfect but OMG it gets very close. What do you get for your money. Amongst other things the best service I have enjoyed anywhere in the world the boutique nature of the hotel helps super digs with excellent attention to detail though I do wonder about needing steps to climb into the four poster bed a sense of place and history Harry Trumans outhouse is a feature generally decent grub but see below and grog with some very fine wines if you wish. great views sometimes with a magic feeling Key deer nuzzling you around the camp fire on the beach below the room to be fair they are just looking for some forbidden feeding and very good facilities. The last include a library a spa a small fitness room kayaks paddle boards electric pedalos and fishing snorkeling and diving trips. Though not a scuba resort bit too up market the dive boat is fine the crew extremely professional and friendly there is both a captain and a dive master on each outing the groups small and the equipment in very good order. The one downside if you bring your own scuba kit is that there are no proper rinse tanks. Nearby 15 minutes run in normal seas is Loe Key which in my view has the best coral of the Keys and always has something interesting to see even if nowadays the site is rather overrun by day boats from elsewhere mainly with snorkelers. If you wish for a deeper dive you need a spade to go much below 8 metres on much of Loe Key the wreck of the Adolphus Busch is nearby and worth visiting. There are also special events from time to time. During our four day visit there was a dinner time concert by a string quartet from California and another evening meal featured the famous west coast wines that beat Bordeauxs best in a blind tasting all those years ago. So what is not to like. Well the internet service can be a little slow and patchy especially I suspect if there is a storm in the area guests are not allowed to make calls in the public areas pretty much anywhere apart from your room which makes for peace and quiet but might interfere with handling urgent matters and the food can vary from sublime to ridiculous at least to my European palate. Breakfast is excellent with all the usual North American suspects nicely cooked well presented and very tasty. Lunch tends to focus more on classic Keys and Caribbean fare at least around the pool and again there is a good range of mouth watering options. So far so good. it is at night that things can go off the rails if you are not careful about ensuring a separation of savoury and sweet in your appetisers and entrees. And I am sorry but fish with vanilla is just wrong. Sufficient reason not to return. Absolutely not.

Your suite is so cool very luxurious and bed is so comfortable. They offer all kinds of water sports and fishing adventures. The Seaplane lands right at the island for air tours or direct fly in from mainland. The restaurant is amazing. The menus change every night and always offer local fish dishes that are the best I have had. They will try to meet any reasonable request. LPI is truly unique and is worth every penny.

My husband and I stayed for 5 nights on the Romance package at Little Palm. We flew into the Key West airport and our driver was waiting for us even though our flight was early. Our timing must have been perfect because once we arrived the boat dock we were given wonderful drinks boarded the boat and were on our way. It was less than one hour from arrival at the Key West airport to arrival on the island. Once there we were shown around the island by Carol and then taken to our suite. Gorgeous. A bottle of champagne was waiting in our suite. Everything the next 5 days was perfect. We had facials that were relaxing at the spa we did a private yoga class with Mindy that was awesome we snorkeled with Bob and saw a beautiful reef full of fish and coral we paddle boarded the mangroves and played bocci ball next to the ocean. Rolando and a very nice woman from Ohio her name escapes me were always available at the hut if you had any questions or needed anything. Bety our wonderful waitress at breakfast knew after the first morning that I liked tea and my hubby espresso. All the little touches made for a very relaxing stay. The food was outstanding.

Little Palm Island is truly a piece of paradise. From the moment we showed up for our 3 night honeymoon stay to the very minute we drove off the property it was amazing. If you are looking to completely disconnect but reconect with your significant other this is the place to do it. Put away your cell phones and GET LOST. The staff there are beyond accommodating and pay such close attention to detail. The little surprises the staff and the island have to offer make it that much better. Shout out to Belinda who is the bartender at the bar by the pool. she was by far one our our favorite people to interact with. Captain Wilie who does the snorkeling excursion is also very awesome and we would recommend the snorkel trip as it is unlike anything you will ever see. We visited the spa while we were here which was also very nice. The dining room is a nice place to eat but we actually preferred to dine by the pool or in the privacy of our bungalow. The bungalows are super cute and beachy. Just remember you are not checking into the Ritz so do not expect the decor to be modern. It is a beach bungalow. The outdoor shower was one of our favorite features of the room. This place is so quiet and peaceful and other than at dinner very rarely did we see too many other people which was nice. We were really able to focus on each other be it we were laying in our hammock outside the bungalow taking a dive in the pool or sitting on the dock by the ocean. there is not a bad seat in the house. I highly recommend this place to couples and although pricey it is worth the isolation and romance it has to offer. If you go there for the right reasons you will not be bored even when you seemingly have nothing to do. We will definitely be looking to return for anniversary trips in the future.

Our bungalow was beautiful with our own private hot tub beach fire pit and view of the ocean. we even had our name in wood lettering on the front door. We had breakfast every morning on the deck watching the waves lap at the shore. We had lunch by the pool. And dinner in their top notch restaurant where the food was delicious and the presentation was beautiful. The Key deer that swim over to the island are a surprising delight.
