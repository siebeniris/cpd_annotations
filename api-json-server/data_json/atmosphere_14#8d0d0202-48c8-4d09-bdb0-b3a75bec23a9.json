The staff are great and so lovely and kind too you can not fault them I always feel like you get treated like royalty out there its fabulous. Wherever you go in the hotel it really is incredible to look at from the giant glass sculpture in the lobby and the huge aquarium down to the avenues underneath the hotel. The two pools are enough but if you get bored during the day of just sunbathing you can go to Aquaventure the water park for free. The lazy river is great depending which route you take you can end up in the rapids or on your way to the rides in neptunes tower. Never ending fun and enjoyment. Take flip flops with you in the lazy river as if you choose to get out and go on a ride the floor is extremely hot so you will need themUnles you want to do some serious shopping in their world renowned malls this hotel has everything you need.

Also asked for a room with a balcony and the lady made sure she could get me one that also had two double beds apparently there is nt many. Food is lovely but i would say there is nt a lot for younger children who might be fussy eaters like my daughter. Also some of the lunch menus at the hotel were more like dinner menus i would have liked more salad sandwich etc options for me and my children. Pools are nice and not too over crowded also there are lots of sunbeds available. Towels provided every day for free. Childrens pool not under any type of canopy so is nt a lot of shade for the younger children. Water park is OK providing your child is 12 m or over. my daughter was too small meaning she could only go on the lazy river and the kids splash zone which was VERY overcrowded which meant we ended up following our children around so they did nt get lost. Dolphin experience was great. We did the dolphin encounter which was OK for our 7 year olds. You do nt get to do much with them but experience is still great. Lost chambers aquariam was also quite good although quite dark so photos were nt very great if taking on a phone. Ronda Locateli restuarant Italian is amazing and a real credit to the Atlantis. They were a big highlight of my stay. Staff are so friendly and make you feel so welcome. My children were encouraged by staff to eat more dinner so they could have a treat to go into the kitchen meet the chefs and make their pudding Ice cream. They also got to hold a real alive lobster which they absolutely loved. We went their 3 times during our stay and each time they got to hold the lobsters have photos with them photos with kitchen staff. They loved making my kids happy and was such a pleasure to be there. Saffron breakfast buffet was really nice lots to have for adults and kids. We had a standard deluxe room which was really nice staff gave us new bottles of shampoo conditioner and shower gel every day. Water is provided to the room free every day which we took to the pool and you can ask for a ice bucket free to keep them cold.

We have stayed at this Hotel in the past and had a good experience so went back even though it was quite expensive.

Oh and they broke our expensive suitcase and refused to accept liability. It came out of the taxi intact but during transportation from there to our room it was broken. They had no video evidence to show that it was handled correctly. They went through a sham investigation and then refused to accept liability. All in all will not be going back to this hotel again. The promenande infront of the Hotel was quiet and clear in the past. Now it has fast food caravans and cabins spoiling the view. The promenade is frequented by pickpockets and conman.

This hotel is like a glorified Europa Park to me. It has a beautiful layout garden and marbled interior. But the lobby reception feels like an airport checkin always full of people check in or out. To go from the east tower to the west tower you can not avoid the lobby chaos. Breakfast always has a queue which surely does not help deliver a 5 star hotel feeling. There is no top floor common area where you can go have a look of the Palm island and Dubai skyline at night unles you book one of those rooms. The beach since it is man made does not have the best sand. What is worse to me is the horrendous construction view all around. that is pretty much most of Dubai. Everywhere you turn your head there is a construction site or one of those kangaroo cranes lurking around. That surely does not deliver a serene holiday feeling. We were not lucky w the weather in February. For the 10 days we were in Abu Dhabi and Dubai there was only clouds rain sand storm and chilly days. The water park is not heated. So be aware. bring your wetsuit for kids if you do not want to freeze. The big royal pool is heated but I do not understand why they do not heat the kids pool by the playground. The hotel is very family friendly that means a lot of families w kids small or big. That also pretty much determines the dining room ambiance which is like a high decibel canteen full of people. We were on half board. The only restaurant that does not charge extra and offers good food is Saffron. Make sure you reserve as soon as you check in. Otherwise you do not get the slot and have to eat in kaleidoscope or the Lebanese restaurant. I will attach an extra charge list for you to see whether it is worthwhile to buy your half board. Nobu literally charges extra 400 AED per person on top of your HB. You pay extra even for water and soft drinks in HB. In my opinion unles you want to come to the water park everyday stay somewhere else. The water park is quite nicely done. But it does not have that many rides total 10 rides. If your kids are not over 120 cm do not even waste your money. There is not much for them to do. There are shops in the hotel but again if you visit Dubai you have to visit Dubai mall which is amazing and has literally the best shopping from NYC London Paris Milan combined. You do not want to shop here in Atlantis. The monorail is interesting to take to see the Palm a bit which is half unfinished lots of construction sites going on. But do not try to use the public transport here. They are so badly connected you will end up walking KMs. I hope i am not too negative as I am aware there are many fans of this hotel.

I informed her about room issue and also complained about not notifying me regarding water park maintenance before confirming my booking she replied with attitude and un respectful way that water park maintenance mentioned on their website I told her that I did not see it but she started arguing with rudeness that it was on their site then when I asked her about my room issue she offered me new room with palm view and free lunch voucher she did n\u2019t apologize her offer was like giving charity not being sorry for their mistake actually her offer was useless. cause I already have half board booking and the first day is almost finish by the way it was 10 pm when I talked to her I accepted her offer cause I did not want to ruin my wife birthday celebration then we headed back to room repacking our luggage and move from west to east tower we wasted 2 hours in moving.
