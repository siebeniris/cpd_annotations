We were upgraded to a junior suite which added a small room with a couch and an additional TV along with a partial ocean view. There are TONS of restaurants within walking distance and the beach is right outside your back door. We got a great deal with grand opening prices so the stay was well worth it. They do charge 40 for valet and good luck if you decide to self park around 25.

Except on a couple of occasions it was very average the worse being the restaurant. Actually the service is quite bad everywhere in South Beach. The crowd in the hotel was more on the party side which could make the pool area very loud and not so relaxing at times. Note you get two chaises on the beach but the umbrella is extra 19 a day which I found schocking.
