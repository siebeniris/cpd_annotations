The grounds and common areas are lovely but they were definitely suffering from a shortage in staff. Pros. Great pool rooms large and very nice bathrooms. although the resort was full there is so much space that it never felt crowded. Hammocks and chairs in every nook and cranny so you can easily find your only little spot if you want to. All rooms have outdoor space either a terrace or balcony. Cons Lack of towels in the room we turned it into a game and hide our towels before maid services needed to plan ahead for dinner reservations. Not a good walking beach. Response to some of the other negative comments that I read 1. Food prices were what I would expect at a resort. Buffet was a bit over priced especially at dinner and it would have been nice to have a non buffet hot breakfast option that was more reasonably priced. Room service is actually cheaper than the restaurants and the beach bar and grill is more expensive than other places. was a bit confusing that you could order the same thing even drinks at different places and be charged a completely different price. 2. There is a Market where you can get bagels muffins fruit yogurt etc. Also had all the misc items that you might forget was a nice convenience to have but had convenience prices. 3. I would NOT say that service was poor they just did not have enough people to do the work. The people that were there were extremely helpful and nice. We had a waitress at the Asian restaurant that had more than double the tables that she should have so there was no way she could provide quick service. She had a great attitude which we adopted and had a fun evening. 4 Dragonfly the company that runs the concierge service which books tours and handles airport transportation was fantastic. Despite being such a busy week they found us what we needed and went out of their way to assist us. 5. Given the slow service at the restaurants it is a tough resort for families with small children where long meals can be challenging. A couple or family with older kids with the right attitude will have a great stay. 6. We were in the bungalow that was furthest from the pool and restaurant area aprox. 14 mile. We walked it most of the time but there was always a golf cart if we wanted it. I was worried that being at the far end of the resort would be an issue but for us it was fine good to have a little exercise. This probably is not the best option for someone expecting extremely high service top notch food or someone looking for a budget vacation. For us it was a great fit and we had a lovely stay.", "offset": [377, 434], "date": "2015-01-03", "cpt": "0", "category": "room"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "b082b497-cb59-4add-a343-9dd1ee85c049", "sentence": "Beautiful Roomy Acomodations Great Food and Service. My wife and I stayed at the Gran Meli\u00e1 Puerto Rico December 30th 14January 3rd. 15. As with our previous stay there we were highly impressed by the beauty of the property and the size and condition of our Red Level Room. Gigantic bathroom and shower nice jacuzi spotless cleanliness comfortable bed. We dined at Chef Myrtas restaurant had room service one night and dined at the other hotel food outlets during our stay and having stayed there before I must say that the quality of the food offerings has increased significantly. Same with the service staff around the hotel and bars. They have an Avis car rental booth on the premises so it was easy to go an explore the el Yunque rainforest the nearby beaches and local food offerings in the east coast of Puerto Rico. The Trump International Golf Club within the hotel premises was excellent as well. Overall a really nice experience.

We stayed at the Gran Melia for Valentines day this February and had a great time. We flew into San Juan and got a rental car on the first day exploring the areas of Condado and Historic Old San Juan. We should have kept the rental as that was our only chance to explore the area. We met the hotel shuttle at the airport after dropping off the rental as we had a transport included in our package. We rode out to the resort in a packed small bus. The resort is far from the airport and far from everything really. What is nice is that El Yunque is very close and you have a nice view of the mountain from the resort. The resort is well serviced and everyone was very pleasant. We were upgraded to a suite that had a kitchenette so we were able to bring some groceries with us and some alcohol so that we could make our own breakfasts and drinks. The restaurants on site add up quickly and are mediocre at best. Nami was probably my favorite with Tempo being the next best. I would recommend having a car so you can go explore and so you do not have to eat every meal on the grounds but if you have to or are not able to like us I would recommend trying to bring in groceries for yourself as least some snacks if you do not have a room with microwave or stove top and definitely some alcohol and water. The room was given to us very quickly as an unexpected upgrade so it was a nice surprise to find that we had the stove top range. There is a small store on the grounds that the resort has a contract with where we were able to purchase some eggs and bagels and such for breakfasts of course the mark up was high but it was worth it to avoid having to pay for an unnecessary breakfast buffet each morning. There were minor issues that we did not complain about there was a drawer missing from the dresser there was some kind of substance on the floor that showed it had not been cleaned thoroughly there was a small stain on the comforter that we did ask to be changed. The sleeper sofa in the living space was old and stained and pretty gros we turned over the cushions the one time we sat on it. We were just happy to get an upgrade and have a bed we were so tired only having slept on hour the night before as we chose to fly over night. The wifi did not really work that wel but we were able to get an ethernet cable delivered from the front desk. Also the TV is terible very staticy but we did not really watch much TV. The king bed was comfy enough the blanket situation was not as good as I would have liked and we requested two extra pillows. The bathroom was fine nice and spacious and the tub was large enough for a bath thought the tub floor was marked up and I did not know if it was really clean enough for that so I passed. The pool was very nice and I really loved the bali beds. It did get crowded of course but I was able to navigate a schedule that worked well for me to avoid the heavy drinkers and the children. The pool bar was nice also the bar on land behind the pool was a nice place to sit and enjoy the view of the ocean. We also enjoyed the hammocks on the beach. The hotel lobby is so nice. When you walk in you really feel like you are going somewhere special. The staff were all very very nice and very accommodating. The bar manager for instance opened up the bar by himself an hour and a half early because a group developed in poor weather looking for something to do indoors. We really enjoyed the views and just walking the grounds and were always greeted by staff who seemed happy. The service at all the restaurants was very good. Though Passion was od we had to wait to get a table though they were not busy there seemed to be a lack of staff however when were were seated the food came out so quickly that it felt really rushed. I think we sat there for maybe 30 minutes on Valentines Day when we were looking for a nice romantic slow paced meal. It had more of a feeling of a cafeteria but because they had an award winning chef we thought that would be the place to go that night. We were wrong. Tempo is the more romantic restaurant with Nami also having good ambiance. Also the food at Passion was underwhelming. The grounds are beautifully maintained and really very quiet even with a lot of people. We did meet a lot of folks that were eccentric. Everything is charged to your rom be mindful. Things add up quickly. Overall we really had a nice time together but could have been anywhere. what I mean is we learned that resort life is not for us. that it feels like you are on vacation in a non descript place. Being on the resort we knew we were somewhere tropical but there was nothing about it that made me feel like I was definitely in PR. This was our first time visiting a resort and while we like the relaxing atmosphere planning to just stay there was a mistake. Next time we will plan a trip that allows us to see more of the area we are visiting and explore the culture more. We would recommend the resort to folks looking for a nice setting to relax but would encourage you to bring a car remember its 16 a day to park there. so you can get out when you want to.", "offset": [537, 639], "date": "2015-03-09", "cpt": "0", "category": "room"}, {"id": 3, "uid": "b7333d87-608f-48ca-a9d0-7745b07fb233", "sentence": "Pompeii.

When we first got to the hotel I was impressed. The layout was beautiful. Decor was gorgeous vibrant and colorful. The fish in the lobby were beautiful. We were Red Level guests so the host directed us to the Red Level Check In. There was a couple there checking in and no one else working. The hotel employee was very slow as she checked the couple in. We sat there for about 25 minutes just waiting to be seen. After she checked them in it took her a good 6 minutes to just acknowledge us. She called us to sit down and in the middle of checking us in tells us that the system is down and we can not get a room yet. She suggested that we go to the pool and grab lunch and that she would call us when our room is ready. Fine. We go to have lunch at the pool bar and about 20 minutes later she calls to let us know that our room is ready. After we finished lunch we went back to the check in area so settle our security deposit of 100 per night. We only stayed 3 nights so I approved 30 Fine. So we finally get to our room. which was pretty nice. Nice decor comfort level. Once we settle in we decided we wanted to try out the jacuzi. First off the plug of the hot tub was out of the tub. Looked broken. I tried putting it back into the hot tub and it would not close. I called the front desk and asked that she send someone to fix it. She said the repairman would be right over. So my boyfriend and I decided to go to the beach or lack thereof. There was no beach. Just rocky sand and rock water. Definitely a negative of the resort. We stayed there and noticed the repairman on our balcony. so we decided to go back and use the hot tub since it was already late after our check in delay. So we go back into the room and to the hot tub and notice the plug is gone now. I called the front desk again and exclaimed that it was missing. She told me that the repairman was looking for a new plug. I said ok. At this time it was 5 pm so we decided to go to the Happy Hour that was included in our red level package. The happy hour was decent. It should have been somewhere outside but it was in the red level check in area that looked like a dark library. But it was not bad. Wine Beer Sangria was included. Light refreshments also. After about an hour and a half at happy hour we decided to check on the hot tub again. We get back and the plug is in the tub but has BLACK DUCK TAPE around it. And STILL did not work. At this point I was just fed up. I called the front desk and she put me through to the manager. I told her the main reason that we upgraded to a suite was for the hot tub on the balcony. I had to ask for a new room. She did not even offer. She finally agreed and said that she would look for another room and she would send someone to get us when it was ready. So we packed up all of our belongings again. Five minutes later a repairman shows up with a new plug and finally fixes our hot tub. We decided to just stay in the room after that to avoid any further hassle or complications. The rest of the stay was pretty good. The main pool is beautiful and the swim up bar is convenient. We wanted to go to San Juan until we realized a cab one way was 120 do not bother trying to get a cab elsewhere because the hotel will not let them in. Thank god we made friends with another couple there who split a cab with us. Also there is no where close to the resort to purchase anything. Food was good but expensive and limited. The second day I requested housekeeping so we could come back to a clean room after breakfast. We came back to a dirty one. Had to call again and she said someone would come over. After the pool our room was finally clean. She did not clean the hot tub the whole trip there. There was dead bugs and debris dried up in it. After the second day of the maid not cleaning or touching the hot tub I decided to just clean it myself. Also when we were checking out the 300 deposit already charged to my card turned into 50. When I asked the girl at the front desk she said she had no idea why they charged so much but it would be released to me. Thank god I had enough money available. Oh and magically our towel cards disappeared off of our night stands which are a 50 charge each if you do not replace. Another couple had the same issue so we confronted the front desk together. She replaced the towel cards with no issue but seems fishy. Check out was simple but two days after coming home I had fraudulent charges on my credit card. I called my bank and they said where have I swiped my card the last week. Hm Hopefully the resort is not in cahoots with criminals. Overall we had bad luck on this vacation. Did not get wifi the whole time there. Kept getting error messages. Not looking forward to my phone bill. The resort is gorgeous but did not feel like a guest. The staff needs to get it together.

Pool is amazing drinks are a bit on the expensive and watered down but do n\u2019t get snacks here they are just OVERPRICED. Breakfast at waters edge is amazing Alexandra provides the best service. There is not much to be done inside this resort it is more as a private getaway to disconnect from everything else which I did enjoy. There are a few fast foods outside the resort but could n\u2019t find a nice restaurant outside so you will pretty much me obligated to consume food inside the hotel nice business strategy. We ended extending our mini vacay one more night and this is what pissed me out. Even though our stay included breakfast they tried to charge us some fees for the original stay. Thankfully manager Jos\u00e9 took care of it. Bu after extending our stay one more night they did not specified our breakfast area had CHANGED therefore we ended having breakfast at watersedge again and guess what. they charged me an extra 100 for it. I strongly suggest asking front desk and making sure you know the correct place breakfast will be served because you could end up paying amazing but overpriced food for their convenient \u201c mistake \u201d.", "offset": [673, 749], "date": "2019-12-19", "cpt": "2", "category": "room"}, {"id": 24, "uid": "33e24cc0-c81a-4b41-af3f-99b933b466e9", "sentence": "This place is not only beautiful.

As a major caveat the hotel became a Hyat Grand Regency during our stay and was still under construction Spa and steakhouse were not open along with some other buildings amenitiesThe property is beautiful with great ocean side views and a fantastic pool. They do not really have a sand beach but the pool and rock beaches more than made up for that. The rooms were brand new and well appointed. We had an issue with the TV internet one day but it was fixed within a hour or so. Overall the food was mostly good one room service meal was worse than expected had a burger but in general the food was creative and tasty. Unfortunately selection was pretty limited only had the sushi restaurant and main dining room with a somewhat limited menu available when we stayed. Additionally the wait staff was painfully slow definitely do not sit down to eat if you do not have at least an hour free. The downside is that given the location of the resort there are not many options available to go outside the resort to eat without investing in a car taxi. So this is definitely an area that needs to be improved. Service staff was very present and helpful. However they definitely run on island time and my guess is that a lot more training needs to happen again the property shifted to a Hyat during our stay so not sure if these were just growing painsOveral. the resort has a ton of promise and is aesthetically fantastic. If they can work out some of the service related issues we would definitely go back.", "offset": [660, 808], "date": "2019-12-30", "cpt": "2", "category": "room"}, {"id": 26, "uid": "1e55a077-56f9-4202-b066-91d1836a9567", "sentence": "Staff Chalenges CANOT RECOMMEND. For the price I can not recommend this property. While it is a picturesque property mostly clean the staff \u2019s coordination between work groups was lacking.

It \u2019s four restaurants where unsatisfactory as the staff confused tables and food took 50min to arrive on multiple nights. Glass was in one of the pools as well.

We stayed at this resort on Hyat awards for one night at the end of our time in Puerto Rico. Pros. great bell staff beautiful lobby area and exterior property large pool with lots of lounging areas where you could check out towels and games. Cons no hot tub area around pool is rough to walk on without shoes beach has no waves and sand is rough with shell pieces. large shower in bathroom has slippery floor. If you are looking for a serene property this would appeal to you in terms of room decor and property layout. If you are looking for a larger soft sand beach with ability to frolic in the waves and typical resort activities this is not for you. Rooms are laid out in villas and it is either a bit of a walk from the main lobby pool restaurant area or golf cart shuttles are available. We enjoyed a wonderful dinner on NYE in the newer Puerto Rican restaurant onsite that is not listed on their website yet.
