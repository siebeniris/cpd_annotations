Free bottled water daily was in the room. Concierge Lounge is on 15th floor. Breakfast in concierge lounge was nice. The lounge is not open on weekends for breakfast but they gave me a breakfast certificate to use in the main restaurant instead so that was nice. Bathroom shower tiles had some mildew on them. Found some womans long hair in the sink. So I was not excited about the lack of cleanliness in the bathroom. Nice toiletries. Towels were basically fluffy. Wifi was reliable.

The employees here could not be more accommodating. From the reservation desk to the folks at the bar and restaurant all were welcoming and very attentive. This is a good business hotel a bit overpriced for the environment. Rooms nice the hotel is in the process of a renovation definitely needed but has very adequate workout facility and nice indoor pool. The bar is average size and they have some decent bar appetizers available. The bar staff was attentive and friendly. The patio outside is very nice on a good day and there is a safe and pleasant walk that one can take around the water not sure how far but guessing over a mile and 12Roms are comfortable the air conditioning worked very well which is a common complaint that I have about most hotels. The in room coffee actually is not bad and they provide liquid creamers perfect another pet peeve of mine as I do not like the powdered creamers. Bed was comfortable and room seemed clean I had a decent view of the water. Bathroom is a good size included a hair dryer that worked and plenty of towels. My only complaint about my room was that there was a metal door stop bolted to the floor in front of the closet. I can only assume that at some time this stopped the doors that were there at that time from swinging completely open. Obviously the doors have been changed since then as the stopper served no purpose that I could tell except that I stepped and or tripped on it during my entire stay. Hopefully removing this will be part of the renovation. Note they actually do have free coffee tea available in the mornings in front of the restaurant this seems to be a fading trend in many hotels. I was on business and was responsible for paying for 2 of my guests. When I checked out on Wednesday morning the female associate I apologize as I do not have her name was extremely helpful to me in ensuring that I received Mariot credit for my 2 employees. I would recommend this hotel for business or leisure especially since the area immediately surrounding this hotel is will be very developed over the next year and within walking distance are many restaurants entertainment and retail shops planned also.

I \u2019m a platinum rewards member which just means that I spend too much time on hotels. I was thoroughly disappointed with my stay at the Dallas Mariot Las Colinas this week. While I was told I had an upgraded room my overall experience felt like something close to a 2 star hotel night a full scale Mariot. When I entered the hotel I immediately wanted to walk back out and find another option but I was too tired from traveling. I appreciate the attempt to remain operable during major renovations but the lobby is a complete eyesore. Everything is stripped in preparation for renovations. I do n\u2019t know about you but I do n\u2019t want to pay or even have my company pay standard corporate rates to see stripped down walls and construction type curtains hanging around. As I continued to check it I asked the check in rep for a bag of plain chips while most Mariot \u2019s would have just handed me the chips free due to my status this rep took about 2 3 minutes trying to figure out the code to use to charge me all the while I \u2019m in the lobby feeling like I \u2019m on an HGTV rehab series. I had no problems paying fir the chips but do you really want to hold up your customers trying to figure it out. It was being added to my bill anyways lol but she did not release the chips until she successfully was able to \u201c charge me \u201c Finaly I headed towards the elevator more stripped walls and long construction type sheets hanging floor to ceiling. I was concerned that the elevators would not work properly due to the overall look of things. My elevator made scary thumping noises but I finally made it to my room. The renovations done to the room are actually nice but the smell of old carpet or something ruined the new room vibe. I \u2019m honestly not sure what the smell was exactly but it appeared to come through the vents when the AC was blowing. My lake view was nice. In an effort to not totally bash this hotel because I do like the Mariot brand it took days to figure out if there was truly a valet option. After the second day of self parking my coworker and I just dropped our car keys at the front desk and told them we needed our cars parked. One more minor thing the upgraded rooms still have the 190 style phones. I think those should be removed immediately. I know most people do n\u2019t use hotel phones but I noticed it immediately when entering the room and then trying to use it to call for services. One last thing. this was the first Mariot that totally ignored my list of requested items that I entered during mobile check in days before. My standard list is an extra pillow an extra blanket extra towels and water. The extra pillow and blanket made it the other items had to be requested again. I will be in Las Colinas area for a few months during the week so I \u2019m trying a few other hotels even if they are further out. I \u2019m hearing the AC Hotels by Mariot are great in the Dallas area minimalist style but new with no old smells.", "offset": [476, 581], "date": "2018-07-12", "cpt": "1", "category": "facility"}, {"id": 12, "uid": "2c7c2616-1fcc-4f59-a68c-3f0fcc554eb4", "sentence": "Great stay for work.

This Mariot has a new look according to them and it shows. The lobby is fresh expansive and nice without being opulent. It \u2019s not far from DFW probably less than 30 minutes on average and is situated in the middle of a large shopping dining and multifamily residence area. There are plenty of other hotels and office parks nearby as well so the location is quite good for whatever you might need. If this hotel has recently been renovated it seems likely that they did not make the rooms smaller. I imagine that if the building is quite old the same room design and architecture was left intact while the entire property got a facelift. I did not ask if I had received an upgrade as Mariot SPG Gold but my room was huge for a non suite by hotel standards. The king bed was flanked by a sleeper sofa and a separate ledge was available in the corner of the room for storage. A large closet is featured and the bathroom is massive \u2013 rarely will you be this comfortable in a hotel bathroom with a long wide shower and tons of counter space for anything. The work area is ample TV is probably at least 46 \u201d there are plenty of USB and 10AC connections plus a couple of 240AC connections which was a surprise. Mariot only made one small mistake with the room \u2013 where the space exists for a minifridge is actually just an empty cabinet. That \u2019s a letdown for a room this inviting but overall not a major negative. Service in the hotel is great \u2013 the front desk is quick efficient and friendly and the restaurant staff for breakfast was fantastic. so helpful accommodating and warm. They even asked if they \u2019d see me the next day and I felt it was genuinely because they liked serving me. You can tell people take pride in what they are doing as staff in this hotel. I\u2019m big on hotel gyms and this is obvious from any hotel review I do. The gym at this Mariot is quite large has high ceilings and a large window to make the room feel even larger. The equipment selection is above average with plenty of dumbbells pulley stations and a pulup bar as well as Swiss balls and mats plus the usual compliment of cardio machines. For the amount of space provided I \u2019d like to see ketlebels and possibly a squat rack but the entire fitness area is above average.
