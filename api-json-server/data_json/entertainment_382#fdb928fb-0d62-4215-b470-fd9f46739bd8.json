It was such a pleasure to stay in this hotel the service was great since I arrived at the hotel people were very helpful the room was very clean comfortable nice view to the mall. My check in was not too late but it was a very busy day so I ordered food to my room and the person who picked up the phone the one who delivered it and the food itself was absolutly awesome.

We stayed here for four nights over Memorial Day weekend in 2015 and found the hotel to be pricey but very nice. Beginning with the arrival there is valet service as well as plenty of self parking. The location is directly across the street from the Mall at Short Hills walking distance with easy access to local highways. The downside of that being a lack of green grounds around the hotel as you have busy roads all around you. The lobby is clean and nice and check. in was quick and easy. The bar the restaurant and a little concession area are all directly off the lobby. We did not make it to the bar but the food in the restaurant was very good and while the concession area was convenient expect to pay 3k for a bottle of soda. Our room was a good size and maintained well throughout our stay. We requested a crib which was delivered promptly and was exactly what we needed. Room service is open until 11 pm with good food but again at a higher price. We were a bit surprised when we were charged a 3 service fee to bring a wine glass and corkscrew to our room but I hope it was a tip to the server rather than a fee the hotel kept. It seemed like each night there was a wedding party going on but it did not disturb us at all. There are plenty of conference rooms available so it seems like it handles business events as well. To sum it up it is pricey because it is Short Hills. but we had certainly stay here again.", "offset": [220, 344], "date": "2015-05-26", "cpt": "0", "category": "entertainment"}, {"id": 2, "uid": "3cd4a94b-a0d6-45ec-982b-885ecfc466a5", "sentence": "Needs Updating housekeeping woke us up before 830.

Ultimately the hotel needs serious upgrades. The most disappointing aspect of the trip was housekeeping waking us before 830 on our checkout day. It should be noted that management did comp us with free breakfast but it was pretty clear that this was not out of the ordinary they should not knock on doors until at least 9. no they should not knock on the doors on checkout day until the parties have checked out.
