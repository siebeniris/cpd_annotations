The only positive thing I can say is that the hotel was fairly clean and the location was amazing. We had two rooms we paid for one King bed and a second room with two double beds. My husband and I had a room with one double bed not the King we paid for. it was the smallest room I have ever been in the rooms in Paris were larger. One of us had to stand by the door so the other person could get around the bed to use the restroom. It was so small it had only one night stand. Pictures on their website show a room with a king bed and it is an average size room. Not as advertised. It looks like they tried to update the room a bit but nasty water stains on the popcorn ceiling dated the place. The whole week we were at the hotel we never received clean towels until we called the front desk. Housekeeping would take our dirty towels each morning but never replace new towels we called the front desk each afternoon when we came back from the beach asking for towels. We never had our sheets changed in the 8 days we were at the hotel. My kids sheets were so dirty with black spots all over them from not being changed.

We booked Shoreline for the first two nights of our trip to Hawaii two separate rooms one for my parents and one for my hubby and me. let us go through a few main points. Good things Shoreline has got going for it 1. Great location From the airport you can take bus 19 or 20 straight to the stop that is 2 min walk from Shoreline. And it is very very easy to find. It is quite centrally located in Waikiki although on on the beach which is protected by a concrete line of hotels and resorts. But you can easily walk onto the main strip with all the shops within a min. it is got a restaurant pretty much on premise and the famous rice ball shop next door. So you will never go hungry 2. Reasonable rates we got this deal through bokingcom at a genius price and compare to the majority of Waikiki lodging options it offered a rather reasonable rate. So if you are only using your hotel for crashing at night and plan to spend very little time in it this is a good choice. Otherwise you would not be very comfortable for the following reasons which are also the Bad and unfortunate aspects about this place 1. Condition I had have to say this is one of the more run down places I have seen in a while even comparing to many pensions and hostels in less advanced parts of the world. I assure you that it is not what the professional photos look like. The carpet is very old and it just has that given up look to it. The bathroom tiles although mopped are permanently stained with dirt and grime. There are water leakage marks behind the toilet and etc. However everything is functional. 2. AC. I definitely caught a cold here in this hotel as the AC vent is directly facing our bed. It looks like a ceiling vent but on the wall the direction of airflow can not be changed. The only thing you can do is turning it off. Due to the humid condition of the room even at a very high temperature setting the air gave me a chill. But if you turn it off completely it will get so stuffy and uncomfortable in the room. 3. Noise. The hotel is in the middle of a commercial block so expect a lot of noise even through the night. The view is abysmal just other buildings all around it. But if you go up to the top deck where the pool is you can see a sliver of the sea. 4. Our horrible misfortune I am sure this is not a normal occurrence but do consider the quality of service long story short on our second night the door lock of my parents room gave up and this took us 4 trips up and down to the main desk to figure out. After about 30 mins my parents were offered a temp room to sleep note that they are without any essentials and we were flying to Molokai the next day. The room is on a different floor and looked like a staff lounge. Later I asked for toiletries which we had to fetch ourselves only they were available as the front desk claimed. So that caused us more time getting stuff from our room and sending them to my parents. By then it was 130 pm. Then we get a call from the front desk asking if my parents can go back to their original room as the locksmith who is off site and came in an hour after being called for could not fix the lock and once he is gone the door would not work again. The front desk took the liberty to wake my parents first without success before calling us to go and get my parents. At this point I just lost it. We found out that the locksmith actually went and knocked on their door after they did not answer the phone and demanded that they move back. Being exhausted they did not. After all we all got no sleep because basically the lack of facility maintenance became our burden and the locksmiths convenience was placed over that of 4 guests. We are not fussy travelers we try to make do with what we have and not tolerates a lot of small imperfections. But this was just so sad. We probably spent more than an hour explaining this to the front desk the next morning. In the end the manager waived the fee for one room for the second night. In my opinion they did not deserve anything for the 2nd night because none of the 4 of us got any sleep plus dealing with the unpleasant and frustrating situation that is not our responsibility at all. is not rest and sleep the reasons for our staying in hotels. I try to stay objective in my reviews otherwise the poor customer service alone would warrant a zero rating. But I understand that this is an uncommon situation and it would not happen to all of the guests staying there. So this is as an indication of the general quality of this establishment.", "offset": [3224, 3340], "date": "2015-02-14", "cpt": "0", "category": "family"}, {"id": 6, "uid": "12b1a628-305b-4afc-9cd7-93f6d61e0c45", "sentence": "Love this hotel.

I really enjoy boutique hotels but I did not quite enjoy my stay here. It was definitely decent overall the bed was comfortable and the room size was fine for two people. However it certainly did not meet my expectations after my research on TripAdvisor and other sites including the hotels. The building itself seemed to be very old and it showed from the moment we walked into the lobby to our room and bathroom. The building lobby Hawaii is very warm in the summer and I was expecting to walk into the hotel and immediately feel pretty good. I get it a lot of hotels in tropical places have an open air concept but the lobby was stifling and the valet parking area entry into the lobby from the parking side smelled terrible for the 3 days we stayed. The folks at the lobby were decently kind but no one went above and beyond. the lady behind the front desk hardly broke a smile ever and due to the heat the entire lobby area seemed rundown. I did not try the hotel restaurant because it was so hot and it was open air. I did not enjoy sweating while checking in and getting settled. The room. In general the room is fine. The bed was very comfortable so that was wonderful. We slept very well both nights. However the room was very plain ragedy not at all like the photos. The bathroom slept strongly like chlorine or some cleaning chemical and it was just old. In order to save energy the rooms do not have AC on when in between guests so we walked into a warm stifling room. Once we turned on the AC however it was fine and pleasant. We had a regular room no special view just other buildings rooftops and parking areas. The pool We visited the pool one day and were a little shocked. It was a tiny pool with one chair. that was it. There was nothing done to make the area pleasant nowhere to put your belongings. The small pool is enclosed in a small rooftop that has high walls around the pool so you see only the walls if you choose to go inside the pool. We left after getting over the shock. Parking. Valet parking is available which we used and the valet staff were kind and efficient prompt. Wifi. GodI will not stay here again unles there was no other option. Overall it is fine but might as well splurge on nicer hotels if you come all the way to Hawaii. We needed a quick stay and we know the local area well so we did not need a nicer hotel but I would be a little irritated if I had come all the way there for a dream Hawaii vacation to stay in an old place like this.", "offset": [2303, 2519], "date": "2015-07-22", "cpt": "1", "category": "family"}, {"id": 11, "uid": "6a5d6977-5924-4ec5-a954-9ea0f4b59e99", "sentence": "Clean hotel in a great location.

We were disappointed with the room service as one morning we went out early forgot to leave a tip which meant that we were left with no toilet paper or toiletries. We let the front desk know they were on to it immediately which was great. We got a great price through Hotelscom which included taxes for the hotel paid this in full prior to our holiday but when we arrived at the hotel they requested our credit card details for a security deposit of 100. This was not mentioned anywhere so just something to be aware of. We requested a room on the highest floor which we got but unfortunately that meant that we missed out on having the bar fridge microwave in our room which was disappointing as this was one of the reasons that we booked this particular hotel other than the location. The rooftop pool area was very small but nice for a quick dip when we wanted to cool down but did not have enough time or were too tired to walk down to the beach. but that did not matter because we spent most of our time at the beach anyway.

We only had two days in Waikiki and it was at the front end of our trip. We chose this hotel primarily due to price and proximity to everything we wanted to do one block to shopping and dining three blocks to the beach etc. First off only book through their website directly. Almost all hotels in Waikiki seem to charge resort fees but with the Shoreline if you book right through the hotels website they waive them which saves you a lot of cash. They also had a AAA discount 5 I think which was great. As for the hotel itself you can tell it is been recently redone. it is bright colorful and clean. That being said you can certainly also tell it is an older hotel that is been freshened so it is not going to have the ultra polished look that new construction properties tend to regular bathroom tile instead of sleek marble etc. That was no problem at all for us since we did not plan to spend all day in the room anyway. The best parts about this hotel were the little ways they added value to the cost of the stay. Most of them were actually really minor in hindsight complimentary coffee and fruit infused water in the lobby for instance but they really did add up to make us feel like the hotel cared about the guests and wanted them to walk away feeling good about their stay. They even had a little complimentary basket of snacks in the room when we checked in. I have stayed at plenty of hotels that were multiples of this price that did not do that. Make sure you check out the rooftop pool even if you are not going to swim. Beautiful views of the city and the ocean perfect for instagram. All told it was a delightful welcome to Oahu and the perfect way to kick off a great vacation. A far better value than almost anything else we looked at.", "offset": [23, 95], "date": "2019-11-27", "cpt": "2", "category": "family"}]}
