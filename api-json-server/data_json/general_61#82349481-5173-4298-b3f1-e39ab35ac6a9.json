I was in the room when I heard someone else trying to get in with a card key. Thankfully I had deadbolt the lock but I was really scared that I could be accosted. I told the front desk about this incident. They said it happens sometimes. I asked if I was not there and someone else had access to my room I could have all my stuff stolen. They did not seemed concerned. They said when this happens people come back and ask for a different room YIKES.
