I LOVED staying at the Ritz Carlton in South Beach. I stayed there during Art Basel and I enjoyed my experience. You simply can not beat the location close to the beach and pretty much everything else. Everything is walkable or a short Uber ride away from the Convention Center to shopping to restaurants. The service was fantastic particularly the doormen special thanks to Greg and Riley and those manning the bell stand. I had some packages delivered during my stay and they made sure I received them quickly and when one could not be found they made sure to double check and follow up with me to ensure it was eventually received and delivered. Ritz Carlton knows how to make sure guests feel welcomed from the moment they arrive until the moment they leave. As far as the rooms themselves they were comfortable spacious and CLEAN. No real complaints there. Room service and housekeeping were both great as well with the exception of one night when one of the housekeepers abruptly barged in asking if I needed evening turn down service. She said she just walked in without waiting because most of the other rooms on the floor had been empty so she made an assumption. That was highly inappropriate but I will not slight the entire hotel for one persons unprofesionalism. They ARE currently renovating the spa so if that will be part of your stay do take that into consideration. But I will say I still received impeccable service for my manicure and pedicure from the spa staff as they do their best to serve the guests with what they have. But overall I absolutely loved my stay and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a truly luxurious hotel stay in South Beach.", "offset": [1313, 1420], "date": "2016-12-11", "cpt": "0", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 9, "uid": "252881cd-9e5f-4c3c-a056-b25953866d9f", "sentence": "Staff needs and attitude check.

The Ritz Carlton SoBe is finally reopenedI literally walked by in horror about 20 times during it \u2019s 2 12 year repair and renovation. I made certain to plan my return stay asap after reopening. Emily in guest relations made certain I had the perfect room. THANK YOU. My lanai room had a blissful pool partial ocean view on the 4th floor. Beautifully appointed with plenty of seating including three chairs and two bedside ottomans. Redecorated flawlessly with lovely white paneled walls and soft touches including area rugs in the bedding area. The lanai was refurnished with a lounge chair table and two patio chairs. The spa was also beautifully refurbished. But I did n\u2019t see another guest in there 6 days in a row. Dining was very pleasant as well. The new lobby bar is very inviting and the resort fee includes two house punch drinks per day. Great place to take in the historic lobby. Also Josh rooms controller was very helpful with club access. I just had to check out the newly remodeled club. It was very quite and the club manager was clearly one of the handful of the leadership team that came from another Ritz Carlton property. The fitness center which I used everyday was about the same. It could definitely use more equipment. One gentlemen truly stood out. Emanuel at the pool had my chair set up in my favorite spot 30 minutes before I arrived at the pool each day. This is exactly what Ritz Carlton service is about. Perfect example of anticipation of guest needs. Top talent is hard to find in Miami and especially Ritz Carlton level of service. This is something you just understand or you don\u2019t. There were a few bumps with housekeeping and inexperienced front desk staff but this is perfectly understandable as they just opened and the previous staff mostly did not return. Also the pool manager was very welcoming as he has greeted me by name for at least ten years. I have stayed here well over 100 nights and I am titanium. I felt very appreciated and recognized as a return guest. My only questionable take away is that the hotel was kind of slow especially the spa. There did n\u2019t seem to be any grand reopening spa or dining promos. I thought that was odd. This study was magical and I already have three return reservation before summer.
