When we first arrived to the hotel I was thinking it was a 3 star hotel experiece. We were booked in a Junior Lagoon View. I called and emailed numerous times to see if we could upgrade to family concierge before arriving but they said they were full. When we arrived we were able to upgrade to family concierge one bedroom suite but not until the next night. We jumped on the chance. The first room was just ok. The remote was so worn out you could not see the buttons and it kept breaking in half. It did have an ocean view which was nice considering we booked a Lagoon view. Overall it was very small for our family of four and the shower bathroom area was smaller than I expected. Once we checked into our Family Concierge room the level of service was incredible. We had access to the family concierge lounge which was so nice to have. It was so nice to have a place to go ask questions sign up for activities. There was also video games and a pool table in there so my daughters were able to go in there for a couple minutes while we finished getting ready upstairs. In the mornings the concierge lounge had an awesome espresso machine and really cute pastries fruit. It was nice to be able to hop in there opposed to the main buffet. There was also a full top shelf bar another nice touch. You could sit and have a glass of champage and the kids could play a quick game of pool before heading to dinner. A great place to unwind. MAURO was our Family Concierge butler. He was awesome. We received treats nightly some nights it was chocolate covered marshmallows or strawberries always cookies and milk for turndown service and incredible authentic Mexican toys for the girls. Dolls games toys it really was incredible. He made all our dinner reservations and Bali Bed reservations. I can not say enough wonderful things about him. A wonderful guy very personable. We will be back next year and huge reason is Mauro. Some suggestions Reserve your bali beds the day you get there. They book up really fast and they are only 50 day which is a huge bargain compared to other resorts I have stayed at. I would recommend getting one facing the pool for a day and also one facing the ocean they were both great spots. If you are traveling with family check out Kids Zone activities. I assumed it was going to be cheesy activities geared towards younger children my daughters ages 10 and 7 loved it. So many great activities and it was a nice break from the sun. A couple staff member shout outs and overall tips. Miguel in Blue Agave. He was hilarious made my breakfast very enjoyable. Instead of having breakfast in the main buffet Naos check out Blue Agave right next door. Smaller selection but better service especially if you do not like the craziness of the larger buffets. Hector by the pool was great such a hard worker and always brought us drinks with a smile. The instructor at YHI Moves the fitness center. did not get his name. The workout classes are everyday at 9 am and they are AWESOME. Probably better than the ones at home. Insanity and Beach Crosfit were the best. They are only 25 40 minutes long so you can be back in your room and ready for the beach by 10 am. The shows were pretty good. We saw Michael Jackson show incredible the Broadway show and the Mexican show. The area was pretty small but the kids were able to sit on the floor to watch. YHI Spa they have a water ritual that is complimentary to Family Concierge and Royal Service possibly to all guests. I highly recommend you check out. possibly post workout it is located in the same area. Not all of it works but it was fun to do. Overall everyone was fantastic. Especially family concierge room. We were in pyramid 3 which was great for us. It was not loud at all. SHows were over by 930 every night and you could barely hear them when they were going. It was in the same pyramid as all restaurants main beach and pool. If you have kids younger than 5 you might want pyramid 2 bc it is closest the kid pool and play area. I do think tipping is expected at most all inclusive resorts but I never felt like I had to tip. We always bring an adequate amount of 1s so tipping is easy. Not sure if it is like this all the time but the chair towel game is strong. Most of the chairs were reserved by 645 every morning. I would get down tehre about 645 and I was always floored there were so many spots already taken. Possibly people do it night before. No clue. Oh and there were some complaints about the wifi in the reviews I read. I thought it worked great. It was spotty by the pool but that is expected.", "offset": [3749, 3782], "date": "2015-04-12", "cpt": "0", "category": "room"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "78a9864e-06c1-40fb-ae0a-487a3c0c15bc", "sentence": "Luxury all inclusive.

This was a last minute trip but ended up being such a relaxing weekend that we wished we could have stayed longer. This resort was so lovely. We were greeted upon arrival and shown to the check in area which resembled a lounge. Check in was easy and quick. Norma took us on a tour of the main building and explained the facilities. We were shown to our room and our luggage arrived quickly. We were in a junior suite ocean view. The room was beautiful with stone floors and bathroom and large terrace. The only thing lacking was outdoor furniture. After calling and being transferred several times we reached someone who said they would look into getting us some chairs. Within 15 minutes a gentleman showed up with two chaise lounges and set up on our terrace. The next morning we had a knock on the door with two more which we declined. Our arrival after 5 pm meant we could not make dinner reservations for that night but we wandered over to our restaurant of choice and got a reservation for two hours later. We were very hungry so ordered room service to have a bite to hold us off. The mini bar in the room is stocked with beers water and sodas and is included in the all inclusive. This was a nice touch. The room service choices were very good. Our meal at the Market Grill was excellent and was a Brazilian churascharia. The next morning I woke up early and called the reservation number for the next two dinner reservations. Piece of cake. We ate at Vento and Fuego. Both different and good. Our breakfasts at Nao were enjoyable. There is a huge variety of food from typical American breakfast to European style plus mexican dishes. My daughter and I decided to not go on any tours and escaped any time share presentations. We rented a Bali bed by the pool for both of our full days. You have to go to the Family Concierge lounge to reserve and it is 50 per day. This was a wise choice as it provided protection from the extreme sun a comfortable place to lounge and easy access to the swim up bar and pool. First day we were next to the DJ booth and it was very noisy so next day we were on the other side by the bubble pools and closer to the sunset grill. Speaking of Sunset Grill that was our lunch venue for both pool days. It was just easy to walk over and grab ceviche hamburger or hotdogs from there. If you wanted ice cream the bar waiters got for you. The hotel also passed around popsicles in the afternoons. There were many activities and contests by the pool if you wanted to participate. One late afternoon I ventured to the beach and hung out on the sand. I saw Cocos and thought next time I had rent one of their beach beds. We caught the end of one of the shows at the Avenue Lounge and it was entertaining. The shops in the hotel were adequate and had a nice variety of beachwear shoes and souvenirs. We ended up getting some beach coverups and new sandals. Prices were typical resort prices. The first night we did not have wash clothes in the bathroom and I thought that maybe this was a more European style hotel and they did not have but second day we received when room was cleaned. The bath amenities included Mugler shampoo and conditioner bar soap body lotion vanity kit sewing kit and shower cap. Our room safe did not work so we gave up on that and just locked our valuables in a suitcase. The beds were very comfortable variety of tv channels adequate and AC worked great. Overall a great sleep. The only disconcerting thing was the morning lobby music that came on at 7 am. At least it was soothing. The shows and lounges at night were a bit noisy the first night. After that we were too tired to care. We were in the 3rd pyramid main building. We walked around and decided next time to request the early numbered room in the 4th pyramid near the spa for some peace and quiet. I am already planning on a return trip in the near future.

Wish we could stay longer. I seriously would not be able to find one wrong thing about this resort even if I tried. And I am very picky. This was by far the best all inclusive stay. Beautiful hotel which always smells great and always clean. Beach is so clean and water is just beautiful. The food is amazing. I read a review below complaining there is no Mexican food. Not true they have an amazing authentic Mexican restaurant that was super delicious. We made reservations to a different restaurant every night and did not even get through them all. All of them were great. The food is delicious fresh and beautifully made. Entertainment was awesome special thanks to Fernando Chacho and Fredy who work so hard to keep guests entertained and they do it so well. The shows were awesome as well. Special thanks to our favorite barista beating myself up for not remembering his name now for always welcoming up with warmest greetings and making us laugh. Our favorite waiter at the buffet Orlando always made us feel so welcomed. Sergio and George the waiters at the beach can not say enough good things about these guys. They work all day long to bring drinks etc and they always do it so quickly and with a smile on their face.

Stayed for 10 days in April in an ocean view room no hot tub on the balcony or jetted tub in the bathroom. The room was a very nice size with a comfy bed and very nice view. The bathroom was good size and the towels were soft and large. There is a slight step up to get to both the bathroom and the balcony SO WATCH YOUR STEP. When checking in you can ask what is available for a possibly better view or whatever you like. The service and staff for the most part was excellent helpful and friendly. We went to all the restaurants. Some are better than others but they all have different types of food so I will not give any of them bad reviews. The sushi place even made me rolls that had cooked meat and talked me into a grilled tuna they made special for me \u2013 it was great. Fuentes get the blackened salmon. Also the buffet had sea food on Wednesday night. Great selection of sea food and they even cook it for you or you can pick one already done. Market Grill was fun too. Nothing is open 24 hours but there is always room service. The pool and pool bar was wonderful. Drinks were plentiful and they have agua aerobics zumba music belly dancing and other fun stuff going on throughout the day. RENT A CABANA AND ORDER A LOBSTER LUNCH ONE DAY. It was about 70 and worth every penny. The ocean is beautiful but always rough. The floors are marble throughout the premises beautiful to look at but really slippery when wet. The lobby is also really nice. We stayed in the infamous third tower. Yes you will hear music at night in your room. Turn on your air conditioner or open up your door to hear the ocean it \u2019s just that simple. For me I loved the third tower as all the restaurants and action was going on there. Also check out the shows at the night club. Wednesday was Michael Jackson and Thursday was dancers and music from Queen. Lots of energy and the best shows all week. We were there with two other couples and would definitely go back. GET UP EARLY AND GET THOSE SUN RISE PICTURES. Beautiful beach beautiful view and sometimes bands playing on the beach at the neighboring resorts \u2013. perfect. If you have children bring life vests AND blow up floates.

Once you get past the slightly awkward check in process you are good to go. We were 2 hours early they gave us bracelets to get some food and drinks we side stepped the lady selling the time shares. she introduces herself as an entertainment director of some sort and tries to get you to go to the spa with a discount if you view a property time share pitch. Our opinion of the food Food is good not the best we have had at a resort but good for the money. Honestly we liked the Market Grill the best pool side burgers dogs wings fries etc. We killed two plates of wings they were so good. We tried the Japanese place which was decent it is the place in the middle of the resort with the canopy bar. Sushi was fresh but they give you 4 bites so do not be shy about ordering a few extra rolls. Tapas place was good as well very small portions so order more than you think you need. We loved the Blue Agave place. their quesadillas were amazing poblano and cheese and they have a good pozole as well. They serve chips guac salsa when you sit down they also have a breakfast buffet if you want to skip the busy main buffet. RomsSpacious and clean. Nice marble floors granite bathroom. and they have a bidet. Private balcony is always nice. Everyone keeps saying you have to have the royal service we did not get this 120 extra per day. and we did not miss it at all. We can make our own reservations and top shelf liquor is nice but not necessary when we drink beer primarily. I was worried we would be treated differently if we did not upgrade but that was not the case everything was amazing.

We had a Great Trip. We stayed at this hotel the last week of October and had a wonderful time in the Royal Service. There were a few areas that could use improvement but overall it was a wonderful vacation. Check. In Arrival. Upon arrival we were whisked away to the Royal Service check in area where we immediately received cold towels and champagne while going over the resort and our amenities through the royal service. Our butler was Antonio and he was wonderful more about that later. Check. In took maybe 10 minutes. Our room was not quite ready yet we arrived around 1 pm so we were taken to the Royal Service pool bar to eat lunch. By the time we were finished eating our room was ready. Room. The hotel itself is definitely older but the room was very nice and very clean. The bathroom is spacious and had a large tub and rain shower. The bed was OK it felt comfortable overall but both my husband and I had trouble sleeping on it. Every day the cleaners did a great job cleaning it up and we had turn down service every night with chocolate on our pillows. The minibar was constantly stocked. Upon arrival we also had a bottle of champagne waiting for us and rose petals on the bed I had told them we were celebrating our aniversaryPol. The pool in the Royal Service is wonderful. The cabana beds are amazing. You are guaranteed 2 days in a cabana bed with the Royal Service but since it was October and very slow we were able to get one every day we were there. We moved around and never had the same one and were able to enjoy some amazing views of the beach pool. We had excellent service at the pool thanks to Edie Edier who served us endless drinks and snacks. Daniel assisted with getting us cabana beds and towels everyday and he was awesome as well. Beach We did not spend a lot of time on the beach because it was very windy but it is a beautiful beach and the water is crystal clear. It was just a bit too rough for us. We did book a wave runner through Aqua World and had to walk down the beach. They warned us it would be rough but we decided to go anyway. I would recommend doing a wave runner on the Lagoon. The ocean side was very rough and while we had fun we probably would have had more fun on the lagoon side b c we could have gone faster. We also booked the Jungle Tour through Aqua World which was really fun and a nice local 2 3 hour activity ask for PabloFod. We had reservations each night. Our favorites were Mole amazing mexican. and Fuego Latin. Bana Asian Sushi Bar was also very good with some unique sushi options which was fun. I would avoid The Market Grill and Vento. Vento the food was just gross it was not up to par with the rest of the resort and I think we would have rather ate in the buffet that night. It all sounded delicious looking at the menu but overall was just unappetizing. Market Grill is a Brazilian steak house in the evening and while it was OK the meat was dry and it just was not for us. We ate breakfast at the buffet one day and it was OK as well but nothing special. The rest of our breakfasts were at La Palapa the Royal Service pool restaurant and it was excellent every time. We ate most of our lunches in a cabana bed at the Royal Service pool where you could order a selection of snack type foods. We loved the chips guacamole wings tuna skewers and nachos the best but we tried everything at some point and liked it all. Entertainment Bars We were on vacation mostly just to relax so we did not spend a lot of time in the evening out late but we did go to the nightly shows and they were very entertaining. WE loved the beds in the bar that we could relax on and have a drink. My one complaint would be that the area where they do the shows is very very small. You had to get there really early if you wanted a seat where you could see. It was so crowded you could not even stand and see on some nights. And this was in the middle of October when they are at their lowest season so I can not imagine if it were busy how crowded it would have been. Overall it was fine though and good entertainment. Service The Service was AMAZING. Everyone that took care of us was great. Antonio was our butler and he made sure we had dinner reservations each night he took care of cabana rentals for us and checked in with us multiple times a day to make sure we did not need anything. He brought us different beer for our mini fridge upon request and left us champagne and other treats each afternoon in our room. He was great and a super nice guy. We also loved Edie Edier at the pool as well as Daniel. Everyone else we encountered was very friendly and did anything we asked the people really make this hotel great. Spa We did a couples massage and the actual massage was great but their lounge and waiting area could use some work. It was very crowded and there was no where to sit and relax after the massage we were taken right back to the locker room. The massage was great though. Royal Service. A lot of people say they did not need it or did not do it and had a great time. I think that you probably would but I am so so glad we did the Royal service. Every need was taken care of we really felt like royalty. The people in the royal service were amazingly helpful and friendly they truly made our trip great. They are remodeling the Royal Service area right now so the Royal Service bar lounge was set up in the basement of one of the buildings temporarily. Except no one told us it was temporary so it seemed very odd to us and not very royal. I think the second or third day we figured out that the usual royal lounge is HUGE and in a great spot. We wish we could see it operating where it normally does it would be much more elegant. But it was still very nice and acomodating. Tips We got the best drinks from the Royal Service lounge. October is a great month to go if you want to feel secluded and not deal with crowds. Avoid Vento if you canOveral our vacation was wonderful and this hotel is great. The food was pretty good overall but keep an open mind. The hotel is definitely older but the people make this place what it is they seem like they really care about taking good care of their guests.

My husband and I recently visited Paradisus Cancun from October 27th to November 3rd for our anniversary and my husbands birthday. We had a great trip overall. With any resort there is always ups and downs but overall we had a great time. Any problems that we came across our amazing Butler Cesar and his manager Lazaro were always willing to help in any way possible. From booking a night out at Coco Bongo to all dinner reservations and transportation needs. They decorated our room with balloons and streamers for my husbands birthday along with a small cake and candles and rose petals for our anniversary. We stayed in Royal Service but pyramid 5 is currently being remodeled so we stayed in a one bedroom ocean view suite in pyramid 4 which was beautiful. Check in and check out was very simple. Blue Agave was our favorite place to eat the tacos were to die for. Also in regards to the food I have food allergies and I was given an allergy card to place on our table when ever we ate and every single restaurant accommodated me in any way they could which was so thoughtful. The royal serivce team also made sure that any spevial treats left in our room were free of the foods that i am allergic too so that I could enjoy them along with my husband. The royal service pool is very nice and peaceful. We did have a Bali bed every day of our stay which was set up by Daniel our pool concierge. We had very relaxing couples massage at YHI. Their locker rooms along with showers steam room sauna and hydrotherapy pool were amazing. Probably one of the best I have ever been too. Also we were there during Dia de Los Muertos and Johnathan a doorman told us about different places to visit and about some great local food. He was so sweet and always greeted us with a warm smile and super friendly hello when ever we came in the front dorThere is only 3 things I was a little unhappy with. The first was a contracted company Outdoor Photo Cancun they have on property that offers photo sessions. We have used this company in the past at other resorts when we have visited Cancun but the employees we dealt with this time were extremely rude and called us thefts in the lobby in front of other guests. We immediately went to Royal Service and they took care of the problem but it was still very upsetting. Second for the most part the room was clean but there were 2 days that a maid just folded dirty towels and hung them back up. Lastly the wait staff at the Royal Service pool was just okay at some points it took 30 minutes to get a drink or bottle of water and it was not even very busy. But like I said before overall it was a great experience and we have already talked about returning.

Let me preface my review with the fact that we are Melia Vacation Club Members and have many benefits not available to standard hotel room occupants. As members we have a concierge a butler free use of the gym facilities and various discounts. Prior to arrival we asked our concierge to note we wanted an ocean view room. I had specifically reserved a studio in hopes that there would be more studios with an ocean view than the size room which we originally bought. That worked we were given an ocean view room although not guaranteed prior to arrival and avoided an argument at check in over room assignment. Our concierge also put us in touch with Otiem for hotel transports. Service was prompt the vehicle was clean. Also our transport was private we did n\u2019t have to stop at other resorts or be packed into a van. From check in to check out our time at the Paradisus was near perfect. The room while maybe a bit small was clean and well decorated. With a few minor exceptions there are very few electrical outlets and the sleeper sofa is poorly designed \u2013 my husband and I each cracked a toe on it the bathroom outlet tripped regularly and was difficult to reset and the hot water was not on when we arrived. The fixable items were taken care of the next day. The ac was n\u2019t as cold as we would have liked but it was comfortable even while sleeping. There was a one speed high fan in the room which we could n\u2019t leave on all night as it rattled a bit. But when we returned from the pool it was nice to have running to move the air in the room. Okay so the power was out one day but no matter what hotel you were at on that day the power was out \u2013. that was definitely not within the hotel \u2019s controlWith a lot of open air space air conditioning in the hotel literally runs from comfortable to hot. Our room was never \u201c cold \u201d but comfortable. There was a one speed high fan in the room which we could n\u2019t leave on all night as it rattled a bit. But when we returned from the pool it was nice to have running to move the air in the room. The view of the beautiful blue ocean as you walk out the doors at the center of the hotel onto the patio area will take your breath away. Every time I visit I am awestruck at the beautyBreakfast at Nao restaurant was always delicious. Service was cheerful and usually our coffee and water were monitored by the wait staff. There were a tremendous number of breakfast items from which to choose Mexican fare omelet egg station fresh fruits cereals breads and pastries cheeses etc. With the vast selection it would be hard to walk away hungry. We also ate at Nao two evening. Sometimes a full restaurant meal would have been too much. Do n\u2019t know if there is an upcharge but I heard that Wednesday evenings feature seafood including lobster tails. Tuesday was Mexican night. We were happy to enjoy soup and salad with a large dessert selection on our two visits. For the reservation only restaurants I wonder if the chefs are trying to outperform each other for wildest creations. They were good in their own way but in reading the menu we opted for the most \u201c normal \u201d sounding items. We ate at Fuego and Mole and were treated to one wine paring dinner at Tempo. At Mole a family came in with a very cranky infant. Definitely ruined the evening. Please I do n\u2019t pay to dine out and listen to your child scream. Tempo is a very upscale restaurant in the hotel. The chef ca n\u2019t remember or say the name is a 6 star Michelin chef. While I could n\u2019t tell you what we were served I can say that the food was delicious. Since this is not part of the all inclusive a visit to this restaurant will cost you big dollars 200 US per person. The restaurant is very quiet and romantic featuring a pianist and the best service in all of Cancun. If you think you would like to enjoy Tempo \u2019s offerings be sure to pack \u201c nice \u201d clothes \u2013 slacks and collared shirt for men and a dress for women. I think we will splurge on this one when we return to Paradisus Cancun. The hotel and grounds are beautiful. There are several pools one pool is vast running from a shallow \u201c kidie \u201d area near Tower 1 to a deep large area near Tower 2. The water temperature was comfortable. The pool bar is in the large pool. The other pool is split with Royal Service Tower 4 and a more quiet pool area Tower 3. Pool seating was often all \u201c reserved \u201d by 9 am. I know the hotel discourages reserving chairs but it happens. One afternoon I did see a server removing towels from unoccupied chairs. Most likely the server knew the occupants had left for the day. Most days we treated ourselves to a Bali bed Members have privileges including reduced rates. These beds were made up daily with fresh covers on the mattress and pillows. Did I mention NO TOWEL CARDSPol service was excellent. The three ladies names not known were the best. We were never out of water or drinks. While we could get our own snacks at the polside grill the servers offered and brought to us plates of chips with queso and salsa. Hamburgers hot dogs pizza and various other items were also available at the grill. In all thank you to the Vacation staff and pool servers for their attention to making our trip wonderful. Our concierge Louis helped pre arrival and made our reservations for dinners. Our butler Jorge Georgie was so pleasant and fun. He took care of the details and showered us with a couple of surprise gifts. The three ladies who provided pool side service were wonderful. They kept us from getting thirsty. It was fun to interact with all of them as we like to learn about them and the culture. Thank you thank youWhile gratuities are included in the all inclusive we did tip the servers.

In general I would recommend. Food. That was a big differential. very nice restaurants and diversity of meals.

We spent 6 days and 5 nights at a Family Concierge room at Paradisus. Butlers Josue and Alexander made our stay impeccable. They did not overlook anything. Their attention to detail was amazing. I was so impressed and I am an attention to detail kind of gal. They handled all the dinner reservations and updated us with events at the hotel we would be interested in. We initially wanted to rent a bali bed on the beach but Josue and Alexander reserved a complimentary bali bed for us at the Kids pool. It did n\u2019t have the beach view but we loved that we had a \u201c home base \u201d. daily while enjoying the beach or the pool. If you are traveling with kids I recommend splurging on the Family Concierge rooms. My kids loved the daily surprises they received and LOVED the game room. My youngest son could not get enough of the kids size pool table. It was nice that their were game consoles available in the game room and even to borrow in the hotel room. Our waiter David at the kid \u2019s pool was the BEST. He never let us sit there without a fresh drink. He even introduced my sons to the Mickey Mouse drink. They LOVED them. He was so pleasant and attentive. He truly made our days at the pool fantastic. Days later my oldest son is still mentioning David and how he knew him so well because he always knew when he needed another Mickey Mouse. HAHAFuego was our favorite restaurant by far. I wish I would have done more research into the restaurants prior to our arrival to have more of an idea of what would fit us best. Overall we LOVED Paradisus and everyone at Family Concierge.

Stay at the Resort Thanksgiving Weekend with my Wife. Anniversary GetawayThe God The Resort is very nice. About 15 minutes from the Airport. You can take a taxi or use USA Transfer I do highly recommend. I was in building 3 where they have all the restaurants. The Food I will give 75 out of 10. The Buffet was pretty good as well. Not Great but there is variety and do not think you will find much better at an all inclusive in Mexico. The BEACH was very clean. Clear waters white sand and enough Huts for everyone. The bars are great and serve decent top shelve liquors. do not expect High End. But again you will not get that at too many all inclusive. The service for the most part was good. There is always waiters at the beach to bring you drinks. I do not think it is necessary to do Royal Service at all. Unles you want absolute peace and quietness. Other that that. No big difference. Book a massage if you can afford it. it is Awesome. Also the photographer takes great pictures if you will like to book a shoot. The not so good. We had an ocean view room. The rooms can use some updating. However I do heard that some rooms are newly renovated. I am assuming they are working their way down the floors. Upon check we were told something will be sent to up to our room for our Anniversary. Never happened. The timeshare people can be a bit annoying at check in. The charge 5 for room service which I think is ridiculous for an all inclusive. I do tip the delivery person at least 5 for bringing the food up. But why charge me for Burgers at an all inclusive when it is just something you grab from the buffet and bring to the room. Def not 5 starI do think it is a great Hotel and will Stay again if I was to visit Cancun.", "offset": [1264, 1349], "date": "2018-11-29", "cpt": "1", "category": "room"}, {"id": 17, "uid": "98139515-0d93-4ee5-bd3a-8fede0d5ae14", "sentence": "We just had our second vacation to Cancun and stayed again at this hotel for the second time. I have to say the first time around was amazing the second time will make me probably not return. Upon check in we got a double bed room over the club requested a king room there was music and drunk people that could be heard till 2 am. When I went to change rooms the next day they gave me push back till I asked for a manager then all of a sudden a room was available. There used to be snacks stocked in the in room fridge there was nothing also never restocked the soda and water I had to call for more and it took almost an hour to get it. When we arrived we knew we had to make reservations for dinner and could not get one for two days. Why am I paying All Inclusive if I can not get in any place to eat but the buffet. Buffet is terrible bland foods and quality has really gone down hill and they were constantly out of items. The wait staff by the pool no longer bring you food unles you rent a cabana 130180a day. Also upon check in I was harassed by a concierge to sign up for a time share and constantly confronted by her every time I saw her to sign up. When I would see her and go the other way. I should not have to do that while I am on vacation relaxing. There use to be shows inside that were amazing they have now moved them outside and they are very boring also super windy and no drink service outside like there use to be when the shows were inside. Towels by the pool are always out and when you go to get one when there are some they keep them behind the shelf so they can bug you about buying some add on package. Needless to say if I do go back to Cancun in the future I will be looking at other places to stay since new hotels are being built.

I do n\u2019t think I have ever written a negative review. We travel a lot and understand not everything will be perfect so we let a lot of things slide. However this experience is one for the books and not in a good way. I would never come back. This place is a hot mess. It \u2019s been a total waste of money time and effort. We have 1 more night here and I ca n\u2019t wait to get out. We are traveling in a group of 20 adults and my 2 year old child. If we did n\u2019t have our extended family with us my husband and I would have checked out day 1. We have one more night here and almost out of this place. Here are a few things 1. Service or lack of thereof. This is bad I mean I have stayed at motels that have better service. Our travels span from best western to the ritz st Regis. This falls way below anything we have stayed at even 2 star hotels. Since we got to the hotel. Not a single person smiles or is helpful. Even asking a question feels like your being a burden. The check in process took over an hour and this does n\u2019t include standing in line. I \u2019m just not sure what he was doing. Handing us back the wrong passports just all over the place. We let it slide assuming it \u2019s thanksgiving weekend. They are probably overwhelmed. This was just a preview to the rest of our stay here. Rude unapproachable and curt. 2. Checking into occupied rooms check this. My mom was given a room that was already being occupied by another guest. She opens her room and sees the room is occupied. Absolutely not acceptable. Now let \u2019s wait another few hours to get another room given to her. 3. Food we know what to expect at all inclusive resorts. The food is n\u2019t something you rave about but it \u2019s decent and edible. Except that it is n\u2019t at this hotel. We have been going outside of the hotel to eat. The restaurant Bana the staff is incredibly rude. They serve with so much attitude. If you ask for anything they get extremely frustrated. 4. Roms we had 9 rooms between our family. Most of the room very outdated I \u2019m talking from the 80s. Bathrooms have a weird stench. Ca n\u2019t get hot water lukewarm at best. We had to change out rooms given some were just not acceptable at all. 5. Room service again basically no service. Only thing I ordered was milk. They say 30 40 mins more like 15 2 hours or it does n\u2019t come at all. When you call to check the status they will say server is on the way or 2 more mins. Another 15 mins go by still no milk. I call again \u201c I \u2019m sorry he \u2019s leaving right now \u201d. And the story continues. They charge you for delivery. Few times my kid fell asleep just waiting and waiting for his milk. I asked them let me come and get it. No you ca n\u2019t. Or can I get it from the restaurant no you ca n\u2019t. Okay so I guess I did n\u2019t have much options. 6. I took a few pieces of fruit from the restaurant next to the pool enso. I was stopped immediately and scolded for doing so. Seriously felt like I was a child again and being told how bad I am. Our cabana was next to the restaurant and my son wanted 2 pieces of watermelon and some pineapple. I did n\u2019t leave with a mountain of food. I understand you have rules but you do n\u2019t need to be so demeaning. Let me know what the policy is and we will comply. Our family stayed at paradisus in playa del Carmen. They had a wonderful experience. So we booked the Cancun property. It was a night and day difference. I would never stay here again even if it was free. Should I argue for a refund sure. Do I have the energy no. We booked this property also based off the reviews. We are all convinced these ca n\u2019t be real. There is just no way this place is 5 stars. Poor service outdated rooms low quality food unfriendly staff and the list goes on. Ca n\u2019t wait to leave one more night until we go back home. I guess every hotel we stay at after this will always be uphill.

I have stayed in newer hotels and never have I experienced the level of family service I have in this hotelWe traveled with 2 kids under 4 years old and got the family consierge package Worth every penyAlexa and violeta were super attentive and helpful. We had a few situations and they helped us with everything we needed. It was great to have a contact that we could reach at a moment \u2019s notice. The first 8 days we had limited food options as they were renovating the main buffet restaurant MalvaBut when it was open it was great. Stand out service from Claudio and Alexis at Bana and Edier and Diana at agave malva. The guys at agave tacos were super nice too. The snack bar by the pool well. that \u2019s another story. They took for ever and often forgot orders they were not helpful at all. The tuna sandwiches were delicious as was the guacamole. The baby \u2019s club was great Paula was great with our kids. It \u2019s such a nice option to have we left our kids there for 20 min and when we went back the kids did not want to leave so we left them a bit longer and went to the spa. The spa was nice but also dated and could clearly see it is in need of repairs here and there. Housekeeping Elizabeth was great and our ser y bar guy kept out fridge full with goodies. Food over all was good but not consistent and room service was great but sometimes it took a bit long. Over all go for it but get the family consierge or royal package.
