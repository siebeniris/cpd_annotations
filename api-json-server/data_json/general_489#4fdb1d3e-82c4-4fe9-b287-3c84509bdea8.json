I have found the service to be unrivalled as evidenced by the nice personal touches that decorate each stay and friendly and enthusiastic staff.

I was on town for NY Fashion Week and NY Pet Fashion Week in Feb 2015. I was very fortunate to have stayed at the Four Seasons New York. It is pure elegance from the second you step in front of the hotel. My little dog and I were welcomed like royalty. They even prepared a welcome gift bag for my dog customized with her name on it and a great dog walking map of the area around the hotel and Central Park. The room itself was amazing with views like you can not believe. It was like sleeping in a living postcard. Every staff member we encountered was very friendly and took the time to get to know us and knew the dog by name and gave her scratches behind the ears and hugs. Loved every meal we had there and was especially impressed with tea service and the yummy peanut butter cookies. Yes the Four Seasons is expensive but worth every penny. I was also very impressed with the way they treat their four legged guests. The Four Seasons has been my go to hotel and I have always been pleased.

Fours seasons is my favorite hotel chain and the four seasons New York is one of the architecturally most impressive hotels in Nyc but my recent visit for an iPO roadshow left an appallingly bad impression. I recently visited one of the meeting rooms for an IPO meeting. Our meeting was scheduled immediately after another one. Concurrently the banquet service came to freshen up the food. The waiter looked at the eggs and said they were not fresh. And asked if I would like something else. I asked for two hard boiled eggs which came shortly later. The major service snafu was the eggs were so hot and unpeled I ended up burning my finger in the process. I usually think hard boiled eggs should come pre peeled but at a minimum cooled in water not straight out of a boiling pot. Since I am a New Yorker I can not say much for staying in the hotel but service at this property is definitely a weak representation of the quality of four seasons.", "offset": [687, 810], "date": "2015-09-26", "cpt": "0", "category": "general"}, {"id": 4, "uid": "4fdd5473-9080-49cc-b354-a0e498d04a54", "sentence": "Good service with spacious rooms.

My husband and I recently stayed at the Four Seasons NYC. The location is great the staff is helpful and professional and the rooms are larger than most average NYC hotels. Further the hotel offers delicious although pricey breakfast options in New York City. The hotel provided a letter in our room that indicated there would be renovations which after spending a few days at the hotel renovations definitely seem necessary. First there were no easily accessible outlets near the bed in the event you wanted to charge your phone and have it near you. Second while the ample storage and closet space initially seem impressive there is a layout issue. There is no door to the closet area and the light for that area also controls the bathroom area. Thus if you are sharing a room and choose to get up in the middle of the night to use the restroom or search for something in the closet you might have to avoid turning on the lights in those area so as not to disturb a sleeping travel companion. Although there is a \u201c night light \u201d in the bathroom the bathroom door needs to remain closed for people who prefer complete darkness when they sleep. My final issue has to do with the manner by which the hotel enforces one of its policies. We had booked a terrace suite and upon registering in our room the hotel representative informed us that this was a non smoking hotel however should we desire to smoke we could do so on the terrace. We assured the representative that information was unnecessary since neither of us are smokers. On our third night at the hotel upon returning from dinner we received within the span of a half an hour a voicemail message and additional call AND a computer generated letter suggesting that there was some violation of the \u201c no smoking policy \u201d. We found this aggressive notification strategy excessive and my husband went to the front desk to convey that message to manager on duty. My husband even invited him to our room so that he could see that there was no smoke or evidence of smoking in our room \u2013 the hotel representative declined. If we had a habit such as smoking it would have been evident before our third day. Further the hotel should secure evidence before bombarding guests with what felt like harassing messages. This whole episode interrupted our evening preparation for our 4 am departure the next day.", "offset": [2290, 2381], "date": "2016-08-09", "cpt": "0", "category": "general"}, {"id": 8, "uid": "937841ef-7a48-487a-90a4-33c0babc3bdd", "sentence": "Very pleased.

On entering the lobby this hotel seems every bit like the five star hotel the brand is known for. The staff at the front door met us warmly the same could not be said of one of the front desk staff and the lobby looked grand. However once you step into your room it is like stepping into a budget hotel. To give it credit the room was huge by NYC standards but the room was unbelievably sparse and cheaply furnished. it felt like one had stepped into Comfort Suites. The only thing nice was the big plasma TVThere was a tasteless cheap sofa and just two magazines not even a Time Out or similar kind of publication for things to do. And we were actually in a junior suite. There was no kettle no coffee machine no bottled water. For the price of their rooms this is surely not too much to ask for. I asked for an iron and ironing board when I checked in and it only arrived 90 mins later after about 5 phone calls frantically chasing for it as I was late for an appointment. I walk into my bathroom to find used toiletries. After complaining I was replenished with two bigger bottles that also looked a fifth used. The same thing happened with my other travel companions in their respective rooms. The more we brought this up with them the more bottles arrived but always with some that were not full. Another travel companion had green water coming out of the pipes when she tried to fill her bath. We also tried the spa which had one tiny shower and not much facilities working. The jacuzi was empty. When I tried to give the therapist a tip I was told they had no change and I had to go to the reception to get my own change not the service standards I expect from a Four SeasonsWhen I mentioned the problems at check out the front desk staff took note and said they would get back to me. it is been several days now not even an email of apology. Obviously they do not pride themselves on their service standards at this Four Seasons.
