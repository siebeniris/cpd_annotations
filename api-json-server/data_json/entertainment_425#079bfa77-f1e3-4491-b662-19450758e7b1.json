I went to Mauritius for my honeymoon in Jan 2015 and like everyone else I also wanted to make it a memory for the lifetime and beyond. While inquiring about the 5 hotels in Mauritius I had received mixed reviews about the Lux properties. But I wanted to take a chance and therefore decided to go for Lux instead of Intercontinental or le meridian. And from my overall experience I can say without hesitation that I made a right choice. The hotel Resort though situated a bit far from the airport and the capital has got a splendid location superb facilities and amazing staff. The location on the beach is superb. It just makes all the sunrises and sunsets so splendid that you will not move from the balcony of your room. The lush green sights everywhere soothes your eyes all the time. There is so much space to roam around and so many things to do you will always find the time short to cover all the things you want to explore inside the resort. If someone asks me to mention only one best thing about the resort I will rank the staff at the top. I have not seen staff of any hotel more helpful more polite more understanding than the staff of Lux Grand Gaube. Starting from the reception staff to serving staff in the restaurant to maintenance to house keeping to room service everybody is so nice with you that you feel at home there. At the end I would like to mention the points where I found some area for improvement like 1. Food varieties and keeping the preferences of the guests 2. Romantic dinner could be made a little more pleasant 3. The activities at night like DJ night and all could have been made more interesting and participative But overall I would highly recommend this hotel to the couples who wants to make their time memorable.", "offset": [1582, 1786], "date": "2015-02-13", "cpt": "0", "category": "entertainment"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "3c32b6ab-55f3-4895-81b0-ce0ced620f64", "sentence": "Nice but noisy.

Ever. After an eleven and a half hour flight from Gatwick the first impression as we drove through the security gates into the complex was WOW. We were met at the entrance where our bags were whisked away and we were given cold towels to refresh ourselves which was very welcome indeed. We were then taken to the bar area where light refreshments were available. As soon as we were ready a staff member showed us to our room which was one of about 30 apartments overlooking a small lagoon at one end of the complex. The room was very well presented with a large sitting sleeping area then up two steps into the bathroom area which had a double vanity basin very deep bath large shower unit obligatory WC and plenty of storage with a large closet. All in all very impressed. The complex consists of a number of 1 2 and 3 floor apartments overlooking either the very well kept gardens one of two lagoons or the Indian Ocean. The accommodation is remote from the Reception area coffee shop bar and main dining areas one of which is right on the beach. There are also two other dining areas located on the other side of the main beach and smaller lagoon with one lunchtime only set under a huge great banyan tree. As previously noted the gardens are extremely well kept and are well populated with palms to give necessary shade. The lagoons and main beach are reasonably shallow and have thatched canopies and numerous wooden sun beds not the nasty white plastic ones. with most of the canopies having lights for evening illumination. The staff are impeccably dressed in white and all without exception are helpful and courteous. During the day they are constantly patrolling the beach and providing refreshment as required. We also enjoyed pancakes on the beach at 5 o\u2019clock which was different and a very welcome light snack before the evening meal. A daily newsletter is available at breakfast time detailing all of the events for the day including cocktail of the day weather and tide reports evening buffet theme at the Kitchen main dining hall the other restaurants are all A La Carte which one is required to book in advance and the evening entertainment. The newsletter also includes some very useful snippets of information about the island. It must be said that the evening entertainment is probably the best that we have ever experienced with two or three acts most evenings. There is also Texas Hold Em poker 2 evenings a week although we managed to convince the hotel to put on an extra session during the second week due to it \u2019s popularity. Activities available during the day include sailing 3 classes of cats dingies scuba diving microlight flight kayaks paddle boards pedelo \u2019s glass bottom boat and water skiing. There are also numerous trips available all bookable at the hotel. The themed food nights in the buffet cover most tastes with the A La Carte restaurants covering a wide variety of tastes including local dishes. There are a wide selection of cocktails available with a different one designated as cocktail of the day. A \u201c converted \u201d mini car serves ice cream on the main beach during the afternoon and again there is a wide selection of flavours to choose from. My wife finds it difficult to eat highly spiced food and the catering staff provided off menu selections on the few occasions that there was nothing suitable for her to eat many thanks for that. A combination of location weather sea facilities and most of all the extremely helpful and polite staff has made this probably the best holiday ever and I can not recommend it more highly. We booked through First Choice and upgraded to premium travel. We also upgraded the room to deluxe which was probably a good move as the room was slightly secluded from the main accommodation and larger than the standard rooms. As we were celebrating our 30th wedding anniversary at the LUX we were treated to champagne in our room and the Manager also reserved a table in the Beach restaurant where we were treated like royalty. I also celebrated my birthday on the 10th October and received similar treatment with the beach around our sunbed being \u201c customised \u201d by the staff whilst we were at lunch. Everyone we spoke to has said that the 3 Lux Grand Gaube resorts on the island of Mauritius have probably set the benchmark for future holidays and will be hard to beat. Well done to the management at staff for an excellent holiday.", "offset": [1875, 2185], "date": "2015-02-19", "cpt": "0", "category": "entertainment"}, {"id": 4, "uid": "c48a3275-0751-4795-93d3-6e6dd1858ebf", "sentence": "Great experience with one shortcoming. During a three weeks stay on Mauritius we spent the first eight days in the Lux Grand Gaube resort at the North end of the island. The resort was founded in 202 as a Naiade hotel under the name of Legends hotel promoted as one of the jewels of the Indian Ocean becoming Lux Grand Gaube only as of December 2012. The modifications seem to have been without great importance since you will still find traces of a basic conception inspired by Feng Shui and Zen buddhism. The hotel plant and its three beaches merit some comments. The resort has two main parts both with three storeys built around bays. The apartments are in general oriented towards the sea the communication ways being mainly horizontal thus guaranteeing protected circulation even in wet weather conditions. Whereas the first bay has a natural beach the second complex of buildings circles an artificial bay whose artificial strand is bordered by a series of volcanic tuff stones fixed with mortar. You better protect your feet with thongs when crossing this barrier. A little farther to the North East there is still a third beach this one sandy on a terrain largely created by filling in. As in the case of the main beach you may use it without thongs but the swimming area is extremely restricted in principle to the high tide period due to its shallowness. This is perhaps why this beach has its own heated swimming pool the other one is close to the main buildingThe first bay has a large swimming area with deep water. If you are not interested in snorkeling this will be sufficient. Nonetheless the general swimming and snorkeling conditions may be the weakest point of the resort the coral reef surrounding Mauritius is quite far away in the North the very large lagoon being shallow to the extreme. This guarantees high temperatures combined with murky water making the whole lagoon to an immense pasture for sea cucumbers bichelamar biche de la mer or however you may call them of all shapes and colours. This is not an environment for corals. Thus the hotel is far from being a realm for snorkelers. This could be one of the reasons why the sociotope of the hotel is quite different from say Lux le Morne where the guests are in general younger. Apart from this the hotel has in principle only positive sides in the first place an extremely attentive and courteous personnel. You may add to them a male infirmi\u00e8re you may consult in case you need it my wife got this way a prescription drug directly from a Grand Baie pharmacy. Or you might mention Nad\u00e8ge who with an inimitable smile reigns over papayas mangoes pineapple watermelon grapefruit and the like. Tennis players may find courts golfers will find a reduced holes course. If you are interested in weavers there are two colonies of these little birds close to the hotel. Spa and wellness facilities have a certain renown. Food quality is in general excellent all wishes should be fulfilled. The rooms are of good quality. The 202 style furnishing is not yet outdated the showers are extremely spacious. Wifi performance throughout the hotel is in genereal good. Let me eventually mention one shortcoming in my eyes. When entering the hotel you in our case both of us have to sign a contract you conclude with the hotel. It starts with this paragraph in wonderful juridical style seven more of them following Afterwards you will find the same text in FrenchI. we hereby release and forever discharge LUX Grand Gaube the Hotel and its employees officers directors shareholders affiliates agents representatives successors collectively the Released Parties of and from all claims demands litigations costs expenses actions and causes of action in respect of death injury loss or damage to myself or my property or in respect of any third party claim howsoever caused arising or to arise by reason of or during my stay at the Hotel unles my claim may have been caused or contributed to by gross negligence or wilful neglect in the performance by the Released Parties or their obligations. When we stayed in the Lux Le Morne two years before I already mentioned this practice of radical disclaimer. Then it was on an independent sheet you had to sign and it even comprised liabilities against your heirs. In the meantime at least this memento mori seems to have disappeared. But by now the text is on the verso of the contract sheet so in all probability nobody will read it. Hotels tend to have such disclaimers especially as regards activities offered by third parties water ski and the like but I never read one reaching thus far. Good practice would be that both parties get a specimen of such a contract \u2013 I had to ask several times until I finally could take a photograph of this masterpiece of juridical wording.", "offset": [3434, 4059], "date": "2015-03-11", "cpt": "0", "category": "entertainment"}, {"id": 5, "uid": "e69a0f05-044d-47a3-be43-640e76fe9842", "sentence": "Sheer Luxury at the Lux Grand Gaube. Just back from visiting Mauritius for the first time and this wonderful hotel right away let it be said that the staff are it is main asset with no complaints or quibbles from our two week stay. Always difficult to pick out persons but in the bar area Ravi and Selman always there to attend to you and top you up with Nivesh Banyan restaurant manager being extremely helpful one evening in the Kitchen restaurant with arranging for an alternative dish one evening for my wife as it was a theme night with very good indian food and indianesian food but not for my wife. A nice touch not experienced before anywhere. The hotel itself is very well laid out with easy access to all the rooms and amenities should the elements change and keeping dry is paramount but no problem as all rooms have brollys at hand and have comfortable bed and large bathroom with plenty storage. The watersports are extensive with most free. The excellent facilities with Spa and sauna rooms jacuzis plunge pools and the professional masuers as we had our first Balinese massage together highly recomended. The other nice touchs are the free phone home red telephone box with instant clear connection and the free ice cream van above the beach. As said staff are A1 and next is the excellent food cooked and presented well in the Abalone al acarte and good choice buffet hot and cold in the Kitchen with theme nights for those that like the great indian and indonesian food. Now comes the entertainment side which could not be faulted with something for everyone nightly with a variety of bands and music that will have you tapping away or on your feet. During the day by the bar around the pools or on the beach there is always someone to bring you a drink or snack. can not forget the very helpful Sandep office manager and David his assistant who we spent afternoons chatting to in the coffee bar about the islands past and present history. So Mauritius Lux Grand Gaube was a wonderful experience that we would highly recommend to anyone looking for a relaxing or energetic and dancing the night away holiday.

First of all the hotel is excellent. We \u2019ve been to a few five star resorts and this is undoubtedly the best so far. We asked some other holidaymakers there and they thought it was one of the best of the five star places they \u2019d stayed. The rooms were lovely the staff were very friendly and it \u2019s a fantastic location. There are two main pools \u2013 one by main bar restaurant which is where families and children are and the children there while we stayed were lovely and the Banyan which has a lovely warm pool and is an adults only area. We spent most of our time by the Banyan where the staff were lovely. There is entertainment every night usually a couple of things to do like an open air cinema or a poker tournament but we stayed by the bar and enjoyed a range of different performers. Indian dancing one night a jazz combo another night. I would n\u2019t say this is a place for people used to nightclubing as this is the most exciting it gets. But we were there to de stress and this was perfect. There \u2019s another Lux on the island if you are looking for a more lively experience. The spa is also lovely and I had an excellent massage for about \u00a3 60. In terms of food there is a very good breakfast buffet. Yes it \u2019s the same every day but there \u2019s a wide choice with lots of fresh bread pancakes and waffles an omelette station where you can get eggs any way you like them and the makings of a trad English. And there is someone chopping up fresh pineapple melon papaya etc. LOTS of lovely fresh fruit and juices. We did n\u2019t find lunch all that great and I think the hotel would be better providing a nice selection buffet lunch rather than relying on the other restaurants. We did n\u2019t find anything really satisfactory in the restaurants for lunch. The evening buffet had a lovely selection and there was something to eat every night. I \u2019m a vegetarian and I found tons of different things on most nights Chinese night was a little more difficult. There \u2019s a separate Indian buffet too. On the nights when it was just Indian or Mauritian food a few plainer dishes a little kinder on my English palette would have been welcome. The best night was the Mediterranean one with loads of lovely French style food. The desserts are very good quality with some tropical twists on the French style. We booked once for the Italian restaurant in the evening but did not enjoy that as much as the buffet \u2013 it seemed rather tasteless and not particularly Italian. Go all inclusive so you do n\u2019t have to worry about the price of anything. The restaurants are quite pricey \u2013 nothing above what you \u2019d normally pay in a five star resort but it \u2019s nice to just order whatever you feel like. Plus it \u2019s quite remote and you would have to make a bit of an effort to go somewhere else to eat. We loved how remote it is \u2013 we did n\u2019t leave the resort once. I live in East London and ca n\u2019t tell you the bliss of the sounds of a natural setting. No traffic just the sea and the birds including the cheeky mynah birds who make a great row in the banyan trees at dawn and dusk. Bring what you need with you. The shop sells a few items of clothing and sun hats flip flops etc. but not much else. There are also some laid back vendors selling hats jewellery bags shells etc. And there are a few very sweet little cats roaming aroundIf I was going to mention any negatives they are incredibly small. It would have been nice to have more classic fun movies in the open air cinema. When we were staying it seemed more like hyper macho US crime dramas. Perhaps some rom coms or musicals for a more feel good atmosphere. Also it would be nice to have a few benches on the front path for us to sit and watch the sea and eat ice cream. The pool at the spa is a bit ugly and could do with a new lining. Something needs to be done to stop people claiming nice seats with their towels and then disappearing for hours. But ultimately this is a very good resort and highly recommended. A few days ago I was in this fantastic hotel in Mauritius sitting on a beach chair enjoying the 32degre heat under a shady umbrella drinking virgin coladas and gazing out through the palm trees at the perfectly blue sky and the calm blue indian Ocean.

We have recently returned From Lux Grand Gaube having stayed for four glorious weeks. This was. our first time in Mauritius but most certainly will not be our lastWe travelled with Emirates Business Class and if this is an option for you then we can recommend it 100. We were met by a chauffeur driven Mercedes from our home and taken directly to check in at Gatwick where we were whisked through security and we then spent time in the Emirates Lounge prior to boarding a few minutes before take off. The flight was fabulous and both of us managed to sleep. a first and even the 3 hour stop over in Dubai was enjoyable. The transfer to Lux Grand Gaube took about an hour but it was very interesting as our driver was able to point out lots of interesting sights along he way and we gained a real insight into the Island before arriving at the hotel. Whilst we had previously seen many photos of the hotel on Trip Advisor nothing quite prepared us for the beauty of the reception area which gives an immediate view of the beautiful gardens and sea beyond which was sparkling in the early afternoon sunshine. Upon arrival we were greeted by the lovely Ticia with a cool towel and refreshing drink before being whisked away to our room where our luggage had already been delivered. We had booked through a travel agent who had not previously questioned us as to the type of room we would like and whilst the room we were shown to was very beautiful we asked whether it was possible to upgrade to a larger room if one were available and it was at this time that Anabele showed us the first of many kindnesses taking the time to find us a deluxe room in the adults only section and driving us to see it to ensure that we would be happy with it. Again the room was wonderful but much bigger than the previous room overlooking the lagoon and close to the adults only pool and the stunning Island Kitchen restaurant which is situated under the graceful Banyan trees. The room included a fully stocked mini bar red and white wine soft drinks beer and water which was all a part of our all inclusive package. There was a flat screen TV in one corner of the room and plenty of storage space even for the ridiculous amount of things that we had brought with us. The bathroom was fully equipped with bathrobes and slippers beautiful toiletries which are made specially for the hotel and plenty of soft fluffy towels. A safe was available and was large enough to hold all our electronic devices as well as other paraphernalia that needs to be kept safe on holiday. A large balcony led off from the French doors and included 2 sun loungers and a table and chairs which were all used each day when we sat and watched the sun go down whilst having pre dinner drinks. Room Service is available at all times and is subject to a small service charge of approximately \u00a3 4. However drinks that form a part of the all inclusive package can be ordered at any time with no additional charge at all and we must thank our wonderful beach man Redo for informing us of this service. Rooms are looked after better than in any other hotel we have stayed at and were always immaculately cleaned. Toiletries were replenished as needed and we could request clean sheets at any time simply by leaving a clever little pillow on the bed. There was a turn down service each night and again we could request fresh towels and anything else we might require at that time. Take no notice at all of anyone who says the rooms are tired looking they are not. Furnishings are Island style and totally in keeping with the hotel and the area this is not a UK travel lodge and we would not want it to beBreakfast each day is located in The Kitchen which is situated just off the main Reception area and overlooks the main pool. There is a huge variety of food available and we can not think of anything we would have wanted that was not there. Fresh fruit was cut up ready to eat fresh smoothies and juices were available as where teas and coffees of our choice. Eggs were cooked to our liking and in any way and there was always a great choice of fresh pastries and breads together with beautiful conserves. It is no wonder that people like to linger over breakfast and it was always a pleasure to be able to chat with the Restaurant Managers Diren and Jean Philipe who always wanted to ensure that everything was good for us. Lunch at Grand Gaube is held in either the Bar the Abalone the Beach Restaurant or the Island Kitchen under the Banyan trees. The last really should not be missed and it will go down in our memories as one of the most beautiful locations we have ever eaten in. The breeze coming off the sea together with the wonderful shelter that the trees provide make this a unique place to eat and our only complaint would be that we can not understand why this is not available for dinner in the evening. It really is a unique area and when it is lit up at night time with the coloured lights under the trees it is a truly magical place. The food is incredible and as with the whole of the hotel the service is wonderful. Dinner each evening is either at The Beach which is not on the beach or the Abalone which is. Both restaurants require booking but this is never a problem and all our requests were granted. In addition there is an amazing buffet restaurant that changes nightly. However the real jewel in the crown is the Indian Corner which serves the most fabulous curries. These are real Mauritian style curries and you should not miss them we are still dreaming of them now. Again the presentation and standard of food at dinner is wonderful and rivalled some of the best London restaurants we have visited. We went out several times both to the local market arranged by the hotel at very little cost and with a local taxi driver who took us around the Island stopping at all the important sights the 23 coloured earth waterfalls and the Botanical Gardens where for a small charge a guide will take you around. It is definitely worth getting out to see the Island after all it is a beautiful place and quite unique. Whilst the entertainment is fairly low key at night the hotel always has live music and an outdoor cinema is located under the Banyan trees where you can lay on sun loungers eating popcorn watching English films. We lay under the stars watching Mama Mia and it is something we will never forget it is certainly not something that you will ever get to do in the UKService is something that all staff at Grand Gaube really know about and they could really teach other leading hotels in the world a thing or two about how it should be done. We met Rishi the beverages manager early in our stay and many times after and he was always keen to check that everything at the hotel was to our liking and that we were having a good time. All staff enquired as to whether there was anything more that could be done to make our stay more enjoyable and nothing was ever too much trouble. Towards the end of our holiday we met up again with Anabele who on hearing that we had seen a photo of the Junior Suite on Facebok that day and that we though it looked beautiful not only arranged for us to see the suite but then bowled us over by saying that we could stay in it for our remaining two days. Never before have we come across such kindness and service and it is something that we will never forget. There is no doubt that Lux Grand Gaube is an amazing hotel. Staff can not do enough to help and service is of the highest level. Whilst the hotel attracts both couples and adults all mix well together and there was never any noise from the children whilst we were there and all parents were considerate of those around them without families. We would certainly return again and would rate it at the highest level. If you are considering booking do not hesitate Lux Grand Gaube will provide you with memories that will last a lifetime.", "offset": [6128, 6340], "date": "2015-04-27", "cpt": "0", "category": "entertainment"}, {"id": 8, "uid": "ed3ca9f9-7526-4902-b4d3-035bbbe3f20c", "sentence": "Lovely Stay.

Derin who really made our stay so so special along with Sachin and Balraj our butlers not to forget simply the best Mr Barista himself Sathan and of course Amit by the pool and beach keeping us safe. Thiery and Pascal and their teams were great at the beach hut for diving and water sports too. This said the bar staff and all but one girl who is name escapes me now sadly are slow and do not service the beach properly. ROOMS. HOTELThis said there are a few things that were not ideal not that the staff could help that. geographically the rooms do not face the beach generally. Some of the rooms are a little tired. However I believe these will be renovated by the end of the year. Others have already been renovated. The villas do not have immediate access to the beach it is via a pathway not far at all but if you want to get up and run into the ocean it is not quite so immediately there. On the topic of villas the 2 bedroom villa is not really a 2 bed it is more a 1 and a 12 bed as the 2nd bed has 2 small bunks and a double wardrobe in and is very tiny more like a walk in wardrobe. Probably OK for younger children say up to 10 12. There is nowhere to watch the sunset. Small things I know but should be mentioned. RESTAURANTSThere are 3 in the evening and the Banyan is open at lunchThe restaurants are all of a good standard and the buffet was very good I am not a buffet girl. especially the Italian night. There is always a selection of Indian dishes available in a side room should you fancy one. The buffet has a 2 week rotation so should be different if the same theme on a 2 week holiday. The Beach which is on the pier did great pizza and salads. Abalone a step up and on the beach itself is a lovely setting with great food. Banyan for lunch is just yumyBest bit was coming home feeling like we had eaten well. No french fries though they were available and did look nice. So many lovely vegetables and salads. We did a half day cookery course with Danage Dan great fun and came home with a lovely set of recipes. Dinner on the beach is lovely and worth doing. The bar is a little small for after dinner entertainment did not bother us but some diners eat early to get a good seat. The All inclusive deal is a good one with no nasty little exclusions. Cocktails are nice and tropical juice is delicious. Great sports including water skiing kayaking sailing paddle board tennis bikes a gym all included they even give you some coaching on how to sail oh and must not forget the pedalos. The kids and teen clubs were all good and even teens joined in as it was interesting to them. The standard of the towels were good along with the amenities and evening canapes delicious. They have a responsible outlook on environment too. EXCURSIONS We did a bicycle trip to see some giant tortoises which was cool. we also took a trip to Tamarind Bay to swim with wild dolphins an amazing experience. it is about and hour from the airport.

We never had one problem from being met at the airport to being taken back 12 days later. The hotel has an exceptional GM Mr Brice Lunot who was there with his staff to greet us and also on our departure. We stayed in a junior suite which was excellent but most rooms overlook the ocean and are very acceptable. We had all inclusive and would definitely recommend this option. The food in all restaurants is exceptionally good with the Beach being our favourite. Jean Philipe and his team at the Beach is wonderful and very welcoming. The Banyan for lunch is perfect with Diran and Porun providing exceptional service. The Abalone is actually on the beach and serves wonderful food at lunchtime and for dinner with Pornima and Nikesh looking after us and making our meals so much more enjoyable. When it rains the Abalone is closed and meals are served in the Kitchen. This is a pity as it would be so easy to have a permanent roof and extend the restaurant so you are guaranteed that special meal on the beach. The beach was very clean every morning with Redo preparing our towels and cleaning our sunglasses and very attentive service from Kumar. Coffee was available throughout the day and into the evening at Cafe Lux which is run very efficiently and warmly by Satish. He will make whatever coffee you want.

During our stay the hotel staff were always polite courteous and helpful in every way as nothing was too much trouble which made all our guest feel very special and are still raving about it. The hotel is in a stunning location and does give the feel that you are in paradise. The grounds are well maintained and always clean. There are several private beaches which were busy but we managed to find spots near the Bar area and were serviced by Kamlesh who looked after us for drinks and food. The wedding arrangements 4 days were all handled and coordinated by the hotel planner beautiful and always smiling Lovena and her team. They did an absolute fantastic job from catering which was just amazing credit to the Chef to converting the Spirit Lounge into an Arabic Moroccan theme to arranging the floating podium for the bride and groom to get married on. Our thanks go to Sebastian for the DJ and technical work he carried out during those days. All in all credit and our praise goes to all the staff that worked so hard during those days in making the couples dream wedding come true. As a large party the concierge were very helpful in arranging mini vans at short notices to ferry the guests into town and back \u2013 credit goes to Hemkesh and the team for making those arrangements \u2013 thanks for ride to the car park on the electric bugyThe breakfast in general was really good had many choices ranging from egg station fresh pancakes fruits etc \u2026 they even made masala tea for our party. The hotel offers a good range of water sports which we made to good use and enjoyed it very much. The hotel itself is modern looking with great facilities free wifi throughout the hotel complex and in the rooms.

As a group we all had a fantastic and memorable wedding experience and a holiday thank you to LUX and all their helpful staff.

If something is not quite right they aim to put it right straightaway. The rooms are decorated in modern neutral colours well maintained and equipped. Our room 1015 was in the adults only wing and looked out to the lagoon. The food is incredible with a varied choice all well prepared and beautifully presented. The hotel has some special touches a cinema delicious ice creams served from a stretched mini films shown outside near the beach free phone calls homes special coffees from cafe lux and the message in a bottle. Leave your wish at the tree of wishes. There is an amazing amount of free water sports take the glass bottom boat ride to see the fish and coral. We hired a speedboat and had a great time with DJ who was so friendly and informative. There is always something going on but it is never obtrusive. The hotel has its own weekly newsletter so get it to make sure you are aware of the activities. Most nights there is live entertainment in the bar. The orientation tour at the start of our holiday helped enormously. Whilst all the staff are great special thanks to Wyland and Veer who keep the drinks coming on the beach Ratish at Abelone restaurant Vinesh the Restaurant Manager.

At LUX Grand Gaube. We were part of a group of 20 people family and friends. This was our first visit to Mauritius and to this hotel and we absolutely loved it. We had the best holiday EVER. Thanks mainly to the fantastic staff who work so hard every day to ensure that we had a fabulous holiday. That was their first priority. Nothing was a problem and we were really impressed by their eagerness to please us and to go the extra mile to ensure that we had a fantastic holiday. The resort itself is truly stunning. Immaculate beaches with turquoise waters and blue skies fringed with palm trees paradise. Everything is spotlessly clean including the beaches. The hotels four restaurants are all excellent offering a variety of food for everyones taste. One evening we were lucky enough to have a private barbecue on the beach. It was a truly fantastic evening and the food and drinks were of a very high standard and was delicious and beautifully presented. We felt like VIPs. Thank you to all of the staff and manager who organised this special evening for us. It was a memorable evening which we will never forget. Truly amazing. As a large group we were very demanding on all of the staff at the hotel but they did everything they could to accommodate us in the bars restaurants and on the beach. Thanks also for that. As a complete package this hotel is definitely the best we have ever stayed in. The location setting gardens spa food drinks staff water sports and weather were all first class. Anyone who does not like this hotel should not bother going on holiday. We would like to especially thank Jean Philipe and the rest of the restaurant team especially for my birthday breakfast table. Much appreciated. Also thanks to Vinesh Diren Raven Swety Porun Krystal Vijay Serge the guitar man Satish cafe Lux Wyland and Veer at the Banyan for the endless supply of drinks. the spa staff and to Redo Kumar at the beach and Ken scuba diving.

My wife and I stayed with our 3 year old daughter Zoe at the Lux Grand Gaube in an Emperor Villa in May 2016 and had the most amazing holiday. We were bowled over by the resort and the friendliness of the staff in particular. They clearly care about customer service and most have been there for many years and take pride in their job which is commendable. Starting first with the accommodation the Emperor Villa is amazing and our butlers Balraj and Sochen did everything they could to make sure we were well looked after. Sochen in particular noticed that we laid out a duvet on the floor alongside our daughters bed in case she fell out during the night. Amazingly the next day he arrived with a handyman and they screwed some extra batons alongside the bed so she could not fall out absolutely amazing and caring service. The restaurants were really good and offered a good variety of food. I am not normally a fan of buffet restaurants but the Mauritian night at their buffet restaurant was one of the highlights of the holiday although it did not beat the lobster we had in their Abalone restaurant. Whilst all waiting staff were unbelievably friendly Zoe said that the resort was full of tickle monsters and welcoming we have to give a special mention to Diren who really went the extra mile for us and especially made Zoe very welcome. She is still talking about him weeks after we got home. The kids club was great Elisa Elodie Sherone and Charlane were all very friendly and Zoe had a lot of fun with them. It was good to have a kids club that took 3 year olds as quite a few are for older children. It was also good that you could access the kids club just to play on the slides swings and trampoline. Special mention to Elodie who dressed up and face painted all the children single handed on our last night for the Sega dancing and Zoe had a fabulous night dancing. The babysitting service was very welcome for the two nights we used them. Overall this was a great holiday and we would highly recommend it for couples and families alike.", "offset": [1759, 1924], "date": "2016-06-10", "cpt": "1", "category": "entertainment"}, {"id": 15, "uid": "42374136-2a8c-4ab7-9110-5d2826e9c45f", "sentence": "Travel Agent review. I have just returned home from the most fantastic 2 week holiday ever. Our room was incredible we had room 3017 which was a junior suite. Beautiful viewThe soap cart that comes around every evening is a lovely added touch. The food in the hotel was fab. The Banayan restaurant was by far our favouriteChicken Prawn curry was to die forExcursions we did the walking with lions which is a must do the south of the island with a private driver through Thomson. Car hire is so easy and a great way to see everything you want to see in your own time. The watersports at the boat house were great and the staff were very lovely. The beach was great and was well kept by the gardeners who would sweep the seaweed a few times a week. There is beach staff who come around all day asking to take your drink order however frequency of service depended on where you were sitting. The entertainment was good always something different and theme related to what was on the dinner menu in the kitchen. The mauritian dancers on the beach was superb. We also enjoyed the managers cocktails on the beach on tuesday evening. I can highly recommend this hotel to anybody who wants to go you will not be disappointed. Myself and my partner are so sad to be home after the most perfect 2 weeks ever.

The initial overall impression of this 5 star resort was one of elegant luxury but not all aspects turned out to be 5star. The hotel is in a beautiful setting with large grounds all well cared for overlooking the turquoise sea. It has a very wide sea frontage with multiple bays and inlets making it very interesting with different areas and aspects. The accommodation units all look attractive externally and command good views. However whoever designed the dreadful internal access corridors needs to take lessons in noise reduction. Even the quietest voice or footstep echoed around the vast cavernous concrete space. The rough stone floor meant that the service trolleys rumbled and clanked along making a thunderous noise. But worst of all there were vertical voids linking the 3 floors so not only was one disturbed by noises from the corridor outside one also heard noises reverberating around from floors above and below. Appalling design does not even begin to describe it. Inside the room was attractive and unusual and the very large bed and open plan bathroom with corner bath huge shower and twin basins gave it an opulent feel. However closer inspection revealed furnishings that were chipped marked stained and a bathroom that needed a complete revamp of tiles grout sealant. It was clear there had been problems with leaking basin wastes shower control valve falling off and a cracked bath with various maintenance access panels hanging off. By far the worst part was the separate WC. It was tiny decorated with grey paint and quarry tiles and walls floors skirting and door were all engrained with grime. It had a tiny high up window and no decorations eg Picture on wall etc at all. Once you had squeeze yourself inside you had no idea you were in a 5 star hotel more like a cubicle in a public convenience. In fact we have experienced considerably better public toilet facilities. The dining experience was excellent with several restaurants to choose from and booking the alternative to the main buffet was easy. The atmosphere in the main buffet restaurant was excellent a peaceful ambiance with excellent staff and lovely food. It did not feel like the canteen style buffet that often goes with all inclusives. Dining a la carte was likewise a perfect delight. The resort offers a wide range of included land and water activities which are simple to book and access. The glass bottom boat trip was excellent a long trip with an informative guide who endeavoured to seek out as many fish corals and other creatures as possible. There are several different beach areas to choose from including an adult only area. Little extra ways of providing entertainment like the open air cinema were great fun. In summary the facilities were superb. All the staff around the site were polite courteous and keen to help. Some even remembered our name after just one day and having dealt with hundreds of guests impressive. Towels are set up for you on loungers men bring beautiful drinks to you on the beach. everything you could wish for to make the stay idyllic. During our 5 day stay significant building work was going on on one of the blocks. This was extremely noisy at times and made lying on the beach unpleasant. This place has potential to be absolutely first class but a few areas relating to the accommodation let it down for us. A thorough revamp of bathroom toilet was definitely in order.", "offset": [2675, 2760], "date": "2017-02-03", "cpt": "1", "category": "entertainment"}, {"id": 17, "uid": "5252cf0c-4bc2-47aa-9f75-0e4e06c74929", "sentence": "One word AMAZING Area entertainment spa food STAFF everything deserves 10 points.

We have just returned from the Lux Grand Gaube Mauritius and have to say we would love to go straight back. There is very little we can complain about and so much we can congratulate it for. From the moment we were welcomed into the hotel with a cold towel and drink to the giving of a gift when we left I can only say ALL the staff were fantastic attentive and very quickly knew our names. Only Surnames of course. We were escorted to our room and told of all the facilities and how to get help if required. Our room was spacious with a large bathroom Large rain shower twin sinks and enclosed toilet. A very large comfortable bed not 2 pushed together plus comfortable chairs mini bar refreshed every day kettle and coffee machine and a huge TV with tons of channels inc 6 nations premiership and modern films. In English. We had a ground floor room which had 2 comfortable chairs on the patio and direct access to the beach. One lovely touch was as you came off the beach there were \u201c paint Brushes \u201d to brush the sand off your feet. You had to keep the doors closed as the humidity outside was very high. There is plenty of space to put your clothes and a large safe. On the negative side there is still some building work being carried out Feb 18 which caused some noise disturbance on the beach. The hotel was due to have been refurbished by December but the work may continue for some more weeks. Virgin never advised us that the work was still on going. The beach was amazing. not just because it was clean but because of the service on the beach. From the start of the day you were looked after totally by Redo and his crew. From preparing your towel on the soft mattresses cleaning your sunglasses to bringing you water all day in an ice bucket. He even massaged my wife \u2019s foot in ice because it was swollen. Getting you drinks and even beach meals was never a problem and when you left your your bed they immediately came to tidy it back up and refresh your Ice bucket. The beach offers many wind and power sports plus a micro plane. Snorkeling and Scuba diving are also available. As well as the main restaurant there are also Turkish Mediterranean Mauritian and Burger Bar and Peruvian. The main restaurant has cooking stations for Chinese Indian Italian and a chargeable Tepanyaki. The main restaurant is all AI and some of the meals in the Al a carte are AI but others you get a 30 reduction. The food in all the restaurants is excellent. You receive quality rather than quantity but we will be on a diet for a month. The hotel has a good gym and support services Spa and tennis courts. The hotel also has a golf driving and practice area. At night there is plenty of entertainment starting from a cinema to some superb quality musicians who use magic to entice you to dance. Honestly Jerry could play anything on the guitar especially blues. You may need to take more shirts if you are temped to dance. You will end up dripping wet but unable to stop One of the best entertainments is just outside reception at about 11 pm. There are some small frogs which make a spectacular loud noise. We loved to go to the bar next to the Peruvian INTI restaurant before diner to sit under the stars with a wonderful cocktail and watch the bats. We were even treated to some magic tricks by one of the bar staff. Our main gripes are the building work and the cost of drinks. Although we were on an AI package which we paid a lot for the international drinks included were limited. They had all the other international drinks but these were chargeable with a 30 reduction for AI and a malt whiskey would cost \u00a3 20 a shot. I know this is a 5 hotel but the prices are ridiculous. If you are not on All Inclusive package then expect a large bar and food bill as there is nowhere close to get to for an alternative. I would also recommend a very high factor sun cream and take a block in case you overdo it.
