Wow what an exciting time to be in San Francisco SF. Things were hopping with all the various holiday festivities going on. We were visiting SF prior to returning home after a stop in Denver. In Denver we have an ill relative and after this stop we wanted some time to kick back and relax before returning home. I made the reservation at this Sheraton one we always wanted to stay at but could not afford through the Starwod membership program. This is a great program where you can use points to stay at nearly any Starwod hotel world wide. And believe it we have stayed at many. I love it it is a fair program and at times it allows you to use points and cash to rent a room. And the cash amount is minimal. I have done it both ways but generally I go with all points. I reserved the room on the Starwod website using points and that was it. Now when you check out there is nothing more. No taxes etc. It is a beautiful system. The location of this hotel is perfect. do not get hung up with staying on the water in Fishermans Warf. Not needed in fact I do not think there are a lot of hotels directly on the water. Be more concerned with central location and that is where this hotel shines. It is in a great location of Fishermans Warf. It is within walking distance of the cable car and bus lines which is what we use. There is also a Safeway grocery store close by in addition to a Walgrens drug store. And of course there are all kinds of eateries my favorites are Ghirardeli Chocolate and the Buena Vista Cafe. I mentioned the cable car and busses. We try to travel using public transportation. From the airport we board the BART. The BART will take you one way to the Fishermans Warf area for about 865 per adult. From there you can walk about 15 miles to the hotel or jump on a city bus. The bus can take you about 1 block away. If you are going to use public transportation you can purchase a 3 day card at Walgrens for about 25 per person. This will give you unlimited cable car and bus rides. Everyone knows riding the cable cars is a lot of fun. But they are quite expensive and this card will save you a bundle if you are planning on riding them a lot. The bus system is great in SF. A lot of people are turned off by the riding the bus take my kids for example. They believe they will contact a deathly disease on the bus. However we have all our grandchildren taking the bus and light rail. Some like it some do not but they all ride when we do. One thing I noticed when we were in SF there were a lot of tourist riding the bus I think that is a great thing. So get this card and you can explore the entire SF area at a super cheap rate this is a no brainer. We took the Bart then a bus and then strolled through the Fishermans Warf area before arriving at the hotel. When we arrived at the hotel the hotel was bustling. A lot of visitors. Our checkin was easy and our room was great. Although the property seems to be a little on the older side it has been refurbished and I was quite happy with my 2nd floor room. We were given a couple of coupons for wine tasting that was occurring in the lobby area. My recollection was this was for Starwod Members only. Yup if you get there on the right night many hotels offer this to Starwod guests. In this case it was a number of unlimited wines and the employee pouring the wine was not bashful about how high she filled the glass. It was full. Great wine free wine and a lot of wine a great Starwod benefit and one that I really appreciated. We were also given a couple of coupons for two free cocktails from their bar but we were never able to use them because of the unforeseen event that was about to occur here. More about that soon. We then left to find some place for dinner and ended up at the Buena Vista Cafe. If you have never been to this place it is a MUST stop. I have written a review on the Buena Vista you should try to take a look at it. This place is incredible and has the best Irish Coffee in the world. After dinner we returned to the Sheraton where we settled down for the night. I dialed in some TV my wife her Kindle and all was well for a while. Then it hit. Sometime around 11 pm the hotel lost all of its power. I mean everything. The alarms came on in every room ordering everyone to evacuate. I have never been in this situation before. I mean other than grade school fire alarms. Luckily we had a window in our room and an outside light provided us some assistance in finding what we needed before we left. However I have to tell you in these days and times you wonder what is real and what is not. Is this some plot to hurt people or how about rob the rooms. Let me mention here if you do not yet have the flashlight function on your cell phone get it it was invaluable. If you do not have a cell phone you should carry a small flashlight with you when you travel. I do both. Ok so as I was saying I decided to take a kind of the middle of the road approach to this situation. Quickly put on some street clothes. Safely if you can grab your expensive stuff jewelry laptop etc. We carry a little backpack so that stuff was already in there for the most part and then find your way out. In our case the only light markers available were the hallway emergency lighting and they were not great but they did the job and we found our way to the stairs and out the building. Outside we found hundreds of guests like ourselves standing around in a dark parking lot waiting for the fire department to check out what had happened. What happened was a transformer on the street failed causing a surge of electricity which burned out some of the hotels electronics. Totally not the hotels fault. Now the question was how long would it take to restore. I meandered around a little bit trying to pick up bits and pieces of information. Inside the hotel lobby there were guests pressuring the employees for more information the employees just did not have. But as a guest I think you are kind of entitled to be that way. People are there for different reasons. Some with business needs others like us a few days of stress releasor. I think what makes me more attuned to these types of chaotic situations is my background from dealing with people in stressful situations. I have done that for many years. Not only the customer but the resources needed to return the event back to normal. In this case as a guest all you have to rely on is the hotel staff. I think the staff did an excellent job in getting this mess organized and under control. During this time I did have an opportunity to meet the hotel manager who of course was on scene for this disaster and spoke with him about my concerns. He listened and understood. I can kind of understand what the staff is going through in this kind of situation but most people can not. They have no idea how much work the staff is putting in to taking care of each individual guests needs. But if you stop and look around and listen you can see it happening. Food and drinks being brought in outside resources on scene and working on the problem. As a guest just open your eyes stop thinking about your own needs and take a look around. If you do not see anything there is a problem. If you see things happening then you know the staff is working on the problem. Now you must realize that the staff can only do so much and they have to put their hope in the trades that have to come in and restore the power. At some point the fire department decide it was safe for the guests to return to their rooms. Now I thought this was a little dicey particular for older people who had to use the stairs. But we went with it and got back into our room. As the contractors continued to work to repair the electric there were a number of hours where the alarm consistently and repeatedly came on over and over. Evacuate evacuate. You had to determine if this was real or not. We finally determined it was not and just a result of returning the electric. However we did not get any sleep that night. Around 070 we decided to take a cold shower and make the best of this. In the lobby we found the manager a very nice fellow I think his name was Mike. Of course he was unable to state exactly when power would be restored but maybe late afternoon. I explained to him why we were there and he said he would refund the money I paid and would find me a room in a different hotel. Well that would not work for me because I did not pay for the room. That was the only way I could afford to stay in SF because of hotel points. I thanked him and we decided to go find breakfast and see what developed during the late afternoon hours. Breakfast was hot fudge sundays at Ghirardeli Square. They are the best a must do for you. However I did observe many guests taking advantage of this offer to return the previous night charges and move to a different hotel. I observed the staff dealing with a number of angry guests and they took the abuse. They took some of the most rude and angry behavior and kept smiling. I was impressed with this. The free food and drinks kept flowing and they had also come up with a way for guests to charge their devices at other close hotels. I found this both amusing and appalling how some gusts would take advantage of others. For example I saw guests filling bags with free food. More food than they as an individual could eat. Now some might say they were taking care of their family. I think not. I have been around and that is not what was occurring. People were taking so much more than they needed potentially leaving others without. How does a hotel manage this in a situation like this. I do not think they can. The staff just kept smiling did not ask questions and kept replenishing the food and drink. Kudos to the staff. You know what really baffles me is these folks who decided they were going to stock their emergency home food storage centers on the back of the Sheraton are the same ones who would have to buy a meal while they were there visiting. I guess when it is free everything changes. For me I in these kind of situations I try not to add to the problem. If a guy needs to pack 20 bagels into his backpack then that is the kind of guy I do not want to be around. As I said my wife and I laughed watching these people take advantage of the Sheraton we felt bad for the Sheraton and all the efforts they were trying to take. There I said it and I mean it. Clearly these hotels do have a mutual policy about helping out each other in times like this. Upon returning late afternoon we strolled around the perimeter of the hotel and stopped in the area where the contractors were working. Now we could not get in close to the depths of the suspect area but we were close enough to hear some various comments. Comments that were not specific to when this disaster would be righted. I then began to think this was not going to happen today. We then caught the manager in the lobby and asked him if he had an update on the electric. He stated he had been advised it would be no later than midnight. He did add hot water had been restored but I never tried it. I must add from the comments I overheard on the street and the manager stating the timeline had been pushed back I decided then we were going to leave. My gut was telling me this was not going to be a quick fix. I have been around to many of these to think there would be a different more positive quick outcome. We only had 3 nights in SF and I just did not want to chance my other 2 nights being in misery betting on the back of some contractor. Nope not me. Now I am not saying these contractors did not work their tails off I do not know either way. I do know that in that line of business there can be to many variable that can torpedo the best of ambitions. No I was not betting on that. I decide to call Starwod and see if they could get me into a different hotel in the SF area. They immediately found me the Westin and Union Square. They advised for me to stay there the Sheraton would have to refund my points from the previous night. I patiently waited in line a the desk and finally was able to ask one of the desk staff if the hotel would be willing to reimburse my points. There was not even a hesitation. YES was the answer. Now I was pretty impressed with this. You know I think this hotel was really doing whatever they could to help guests. I mean right now. Money did not seem to be driving them to help out others. You have to give them a lot of credit for this. Starwod advised they would need to speak with someone at the hotel to finalize the return of my points. The problem was the hotel had not electric service which meant they had no telephone service. So I passed my cell phone to the hotel desk clerk and the whole deal was done in 20 seconds. So I confirmed with the desk staff they would refund my points and then checked out. We then walked about one block to a bus stop near the Buena Vista. Jumped on a bus and headed to the Westin at Union Square. The Westin a very fine hotel was there waiting for us. A quick check in put us in one of the tower rooms and things were great again. I will review the Westin in a separate review. After we returned home i received an email from the manager of the Sheraton. I had done a quick review of the hotel and situation on the Starwod website. I try to tell it like it is. The manager offered one free night at his hotel when I return to SF and I thought that was really nice of him to do. All in all I got my points back they placed me in another great hotel and I received a free night at the Sheraton for a time I return. My only critique of this disaster deals with when the guests were all in the parking lot waiting for information. Now perhaps I missed it as I did not wait for ever as I went across the street to the restaurant thinking I might wait this out for a while there. But what I did not see happen was some sort of incident command take place here. I expected there to be a formal system in place where a hotel staff member would communicate to the guests what had occurred and what was being done to remedy this. I did not see this. I saw a lot of people standing around all asking the same questions. People did not know if it was safe to stand in the lot or get farther away. There are a variety of ways how the hotel could have communicated with the guests in this situation but I really did not observe anything that was effective or efficient. Here I think the hotel could have done a better job and would expect that from a future incident. When you are standing outside in a dark parking lot in your pajamas you want some answers and I think you deserve them. Other than that the hotel was outstanding. And oh yea I was never able to get my two free cocktails. Boo. To conclude that was a bad experience totally out of the hotels control. The hotel did an extraordinary job trying to help and comfort guests from all over the world. They worked in fairly bad environment no lights no power etc to address the needs of their guests. The employees did not go home. Shift over time to go no that did not happen. I felt the manager and staff sincerely cared about their guests and if that does not mean anything to you then you are staying at the wrong places. It means something to me and I would without hesitation recommend this hotel to everyone in the future. If you are going to Fishermans Warf this is the hotel to stay at. If you are looking for an uncompromised level of service this is where you will find it. If you are looking for a hotel staff that regards you as something more than the current nights hook this is the place to be. Staying in Fishermans Warf then stay at the Sheraton you will not be disappointed and I assure you you will really be treated as the valuable person not guest that you are.
