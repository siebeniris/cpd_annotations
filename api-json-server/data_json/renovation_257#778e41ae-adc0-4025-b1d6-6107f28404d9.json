I must say I enjoy my stay each and every time. During this stage I was given room 1021. My views of downtown Madison. The room itself was clean although the bathtub could have used a little more scrubbing. The room was very relaxing and well decorated. The room service menu is a slimed down version of the restaurants menu downstairs. I wish they would include more offerings from the restaurant on the room service menu.

A room at the Hilton was up for a big discount so we jumped at the chance seeing as how the rooms were normally 265 a night. When you go to a hotel that costs 265 a night you can not help but notice little things. The pool is small and the jacuzi was broken when we were there. There is no arcade or game room eg ping pong table fosbal for entertainment. The signs all around the hotel say ice and vending but there are no vending machines anywhere. it is just ice. The food at the Olive restaurant was passable but nothing special. The fries and onion rings were good the entrees themselves were average. When we booked the room the website proclaimed free wifi throughout the hotel. So did the guest books in our room. However the wifi actually costs 5 per day. When we arrived a parking lot attendant told us that our room cards would get us into and out of the garage \u2014 while neglecting to mention that the garage cost 17 a night. In the morning we discovered that there is no complementary breakfast. You can buy a piece of toast for 2 or some yogurt for 5\u2014it is all a complete ripof \u2014 but there is not even a token attempt to let you walk out the door in the morning with some food in your stomach. The rooms themselves are fine but nothing 4star worthy. The beds are small we had a choice of either 1 king side bed or two doubles so get ready to get cozy if you are a couple traveling with kids. The AC was ridiculously loud and hilariously ineffective \u2014 we had to set it to 66 degrees before the room got comfortable at night. If we had gone to Holiday Inn we would have had free parking free breakfast free wifi a bigger pool and a room of comparable quality and cleanliness \u2014 plus maybe bigger beds and a quieter AC. To be fair the staff were excellent. We complained and they took off the 5 wifi and 17 parking charge. But I can not judge the hotel based on the fact that we got these BS charges refunded. Clearly the hotel is making bank on people who are either too timid to complain or too rich to care. Gouging your guests for basic amenities such as wifi parking and breakfast is the sort nickle and diming BS I had expect from a sleazy mobile game not a 4star hotel. Seriously. What hotel does not have free wifi parking and breakfast. it is like the Hilton is actively trying to take steps backwards. Changing free wifi to paid wifi and implementing that policy BEFORE updating the website and the booklets INSIDE ALL OF THE ROOMS just reeks of bad management.

Called down to switch rooms and was told there is nothing comparable to give us and they wo n\u2019t offer any compensation for the inconvenience.

It has been an hour and we are still waiting for our original room to be ready to stay in. Additionally there is a lot of dust piled up in corners.
