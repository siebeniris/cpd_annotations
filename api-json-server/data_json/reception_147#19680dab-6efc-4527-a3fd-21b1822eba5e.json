I have just returned from the most amazing holiday of my life courtesy of The Four Seasons Kuda Hura. This hotel and its wonderful staff just tick every single box you could possibly wish to tick on your holiday. The resort was simply stunning. From arrival at Male airport we were escorted into a welcoming lounge to wait for our speedboat. The crossing was a bit choppy and staff were aplenty on the boat to make sure we were ok and not concerned. The arrival at the resort was beautiful and staff could not have done more to make us feel at home. Our water bungalow was out of this world and we did not even need to go snorkeling as the array of fish that passed by our home for the 5 days we were there were spectacular. We had rays and shark as well as a huge abundance of fish day after day. Although the resort and accommodation was second to none what really sets this place apart from any other is the attentiveness and professionalism of the staff all of them. Everybody is so welcoming and nothing is too much trouble. The food must also get a mention as this was by far the best food I have ever tasted. As a fussy vegetarian I even tried things I had never tried before in my life and every single restaurant on this resort offers exceptional choice and quality of food. Normally when a holiday draws to a close I am sad but in many ways looking forward to going home this time was different. I was so sad to leave this beautiful paradise but I know 100.

Perfect rooms beach housekeeping front desk pool staff beach staff buggy staff. So personalized from arrival to departure just like any Four Seasons. The staff is well trained. Very polite. Smiling faces all around starring from airport greeting to depature check in. The resort is quiet maybe too quiet for families. We were worried about our neighbors since our kids tend to play loud. It is surprising that most reviews only mention the hotel rooms and not the beach situations. Even the tripadvisor selections do not have beach under know for. Not all beaches in the Maldives are picture perfect. Some actually have so many corals that you can not even swim barefoot. The Kuda Hura beach is excellent IF you choose the sunset side. Sunrise is recommended for snorkeling but you can always go to the sunrise side whenever you want. So why would you choose the jumpy waters when you are visiting Maldives. Go for the sunset side. And Four Seasons Kuda Hura sunset side is actually facing west. Some resorts sell sunset rooms which are not west. Be careful of this. Must ask for island map with compass anywhere you go not all islands are situated as top N bottom S left W right E. Kuda Hura cordidanates are perfect. So coming to the rest perfect resort for families. Ours are 8 and 11 so we are p ased the Kids Club. Can not comment on that. But as far as we have seen the Kids Club is for really young kids. The only sort of negative comment I can make is the menu selections for picky eaters. There are enough restaurants but not enough western selections. And lastly the resort is expensive. Is it worth the money. Well we close our eyes when it comes to this sort of family vacation. But yes 15 dollars for a galss of wine is expensive. Each lunch goes up to a 100 dollars and each dinner does come up to 200 dollars for a family for 4 and this is minus the alchohol. So once you select a four seasons you must be ready for this.

We frequently go to Four Seasons Resorts due to their excellence in quality professional nature and friendly staff. Kuda Hura ticked all the boxes for us as far as Four Seasons resorts go. The actual resort was stunning surrounded by the 360 degrees of breathtaking sea views allowing guests to reach the water in a matter of seconds. One thing that this resort really prides itself on is it is service. Every single member of staff were both extremely kind and very well trained which was a great plus due to the homey nature of the hotel. The snorkeling safaris are highly recommend the diving is also great too. The food was amazing was always fresh somedays serving entire freshly caught tuna and swordfish. All the rooms were to a high standard we stayed at beach bungalow with pool and thought that the garden size was fantastic but the room was nearing the small side. The decor was quite simply done but still very nice even though the hotel is nearing its 17th year.

The excellent service starts with the friendly hotel staff at the airport the transfer is smooth and requires just about 30 minutes by speedboat. The resort is based on a long stretched island. Both sides sunrise or sunset are equally beautiful. I prefer the sunrise side but this is the more active side as the water activities are based on that side of the island. The sunrise side is more quiet but better for some basic snorkeling. Common facilities as well as those in the bungalows are well maintained. Staff is very efficient in taking care of any shortfalls or issues. Fitness centre kids club business center are all in good condition. The quality of the food at the various restaurants is excellent. Guests can participate in many excursions ranging from sightseeing to fishing and snorkeling trips. Our favourite was the dolphin cruise. All in all a very well run resort with well trained staff who are anticipating your needs whenever possible.

From the reception buggy drivers restaurant staff housekeeping the managers gym staff yoga instructors even those sweeping the beach were all very nice friendly accommodating. There is not anything they will not do to make sure their guests have the best time. One perfect example was when we experienced a storm on our 4th night we did not want to go out of our villas because our 3 villas were located on stilts we will need to pass the boardwalk going to the restaurant. We ordered room service but 30 mins. later a restaurant staff informed us that it was difficult for them to deliver the food because they could not assure the quality of the food if they will bring the food with the strong winds rain instead they offered to escort all of us to the restaurant. We told them we did not want to get wet from the rain so we do not mind if they deliver the food in plastic containers we will understand if the food was not hot anymore without the usual cutlery formalities under the circumstances. They delivered our food after a few more minutes when we were asking to sign the bill we were informed that it was complimentary because of the inconvenience we experienced brought about by the storm because of the casual preparation. If that was not what an impeccable service is I do not know what is. We booked 3 sunrise water bungalows the 3rd bungalow with a pool. I requested that all 3 bungalows to be adjacent or near each other. When we arrived there were no available 3 water bungalows that were adjacent so they just upgraded our 2 bungalows to be adjacent to the 3rd water bungalow with pool. The water bungalow is so beautiful we can go down behind our room walk to the sandbar. At night we stay on our balcony to watch the sharks mantarays swim by. We even saw a big turtle in front of our bungalow. We also enjoyed the facilities amenities. The gym was open 24 hrs my children enjoyed the sports activities like wake boarding snorkeling banana boat. We also joined the shark safari and the turtle safari. The swimming pools were also very nice. Lastly i truly appreciate when they extended us a late check out our flight was at 10 pm the management was kind enough to allow our 2 rooms a 90 pm check out while the 3rd room was given till 12 noon. The housekeeping surprised me my husband on our last night when they decorated our bath tub with heart shaped rose petals complete with a cold drink. We stayed 8 full days at Four Seasons it was not enough when you are having a grand time. I had say Four Seasons surpassed my familys expectations. The minute we set foot on the island we felt we were in paradise.

This is our third time visit Maldives and our first experience to stay in Four Seasons Resort. I set a very high expectation after reading other travellers reviews on this resort. No disappointment after 6 days stay in this resort. We stayed in both water bungalow and beach bungalow and we found that beach bungalow is more suitable for family with kids. The decoration and facilities inside the bungalow are simple and definitely not luxury one yet we enjoy its Maldivian style everything inside are well maintained and clean. The Wow factor comes from the services they offered. Service at all levels are excellent and unbeatable from buggy driver staff in restaurants spa beach and kids club. Compliment must be given to Mas who in charge of the kids club. She is very experienced and understand all kids need. My son enjoyed his time in kids club every day and this is the best kids club that we so far visited. This is a very kids friendly resort. All staff love to play with my son and take care of him. Special thank to the whole team of Cafe Hura Osuma DeDe and Henry. as well as Joseph of Reef Club. My son already asked us to book this resort for a longer stay next year. He misses all of you. Here are some suggestion points to note. 1. We had been provided with the kids club timetable 3 months prior to arrival and we found that same timetable applies during our stay. We hope that some new activities will be added when we come again next year. 2. We mentioned upon our check in that our trip is for belated celebration of my sons birthday and the staff told us that some arrangement like complimentary birthday cake could be arranged. It turned out that no birthday surprise had been given. As we had changed from water bungalow to beach bungalow on the third day perhaps this special remark was missed. 3. Choices of dessert both lunch and dinner is a bit limited. Also kids menu for all restaurants for both lunch and dinner are the same. A bit boring if stay longer. 4. We visited the Sunset Bar a few times in order to join the hermit crab racing. When we sit there to wait for the race nobody from the Bar invited us to order drink or approach us.

Amazing customer service. Every single staff went the extra mile for guests. Guests are first greeted with a welcome ceremony consisting of the hotel GM and assistant GM. Staff will check in for you while you sit and sip on your colada. Whatever requests you may have will resonate throughout the entire hotel. We wanted a later boat ride to the airport and the staff remembered this detail for the two days we stayed there and was able to do it for us. They did not ignore this small request like most places would do if it is inconvenient for them. At the restaurants staff will know your name and come over to say hello and see how you are doing. At every restaurant we dined at the manager would come over to greet us and ensure that the dining experience was every bit as exceptional as possible. At your first visit to the breakfast and dinner buffet the host or hostess will take you around and introduce the various stations and options for you. All of the kitchen staff are also incredibly accommodating as far as food requests from warming up soy milk to steaming crab legs. Everyone is super knowledgeable of all the events that are going on throughout the hotel. And they will give you many options to get you to engage in as many activities as possible. You can borrow snorkeling gear for free from the recreation center as well as a number of other equipment and the entire staff is very helpful with directing you to the best locations based on that day weeks weather and tide conditions. The staff fully trusted us did not rush us to return the equipment. The only con I can think of are the buffets. They are very expensive but food quality and variety make it well worth it. The guava juice is to die for. The rooms were splendidly designed. We stayed in a water villa and although smaller than other villas we have stayed at the layout was excellent with the shower adjoining the deck so as to have a rinse before entering the living quarters. The housekeeping staff was exceptional and remembered all of our preferences. The only notable item was the water villas lacked a private pool jacuzi which other equivalently marketed villas would have. However I was informed by the staff that upcoming renovations would add a pool jacuzi to all the water villas. Because our flight is at 11 pm we asked what the latest time we can do for late checkout. They actually allowed us to keep our room until 9 pm free of charge so that we could relax in our room until the departure time rather than have to wait in an airport lounge or restaurant.

We stayed in a beach villa on the sunset side towards the Reef Club end of the island and it was absolutely amazing. The room was very spacious and beautifully appointed with a huge incredibly comfy bed. But it was the private pool and private outdoor shower off the bathroom. that really set the room apart for us. There was a fantastic indoor shower and bath for anyone that does n\u2019t fancy a totally private shower outdoors. Room servicing was top notch too ensuring the room was always spotless no matter how much sand you acidently traipsed inBeach access was straight from the end of our rooms \u2019 garden area and during our stay we had sole use of the beach sun beds right by our bungalow. This was great but made even better by the fantastic service of having them made up for you and fresh cool fruit infused water and towels delivered to you and topped up. We did plenty of snorkeling and even our first diving experience whilst on the island. Snorkeling on the sunrise side of the island inside the reef is fantastic and perfect for getting to grips with fins and a snorkel before venturing on one of the excursions further afield. I \u2019ve never seen as many amazing fish as I saw in the Maldives coming from the UK it is almost unbelievable how many fish and how bright they are even just off the beach. We did the shark and turtle excursions and on both trips we saw what we were hoping to along with so much more. We did the dolphin cruise too and saw several pods of dolphins they did some amazing jumps and flips. Make sure you do n\u2019t forget to try a brownie if they have them on your excursion they \u2019re to die forEating and drinking on the island was a treat too. The Reef Club was fantastic and lovely to sit there looking out over the sea. The Maldivian Pizza at lunchtime was great and the tuna in the evening pretty amazing. The Indian restaurant was our favourite evening spot I ca n\u2019t remember the name of anything we ate but everything we tried was very tasty. Breakfast was pretty spot on too with a huge selection on offer. My only memorable criticism for our stay would actually be the vienoiserie at breakfast was n\u2019t as good as I was hoping for. But then with the range of other really good options to try I ca n\u2019t really complain. The bar team at the main bar knocked up some very tasty concoctions which were perfect for sipping as the sun went down the hotel even operates on its own Island time to make sunrise and sunset that much more convenient for the guests. So all in all a pretty fantastic place to stay and enjoy.", "offset": [2725, 2960], "date": "2016-01-13", "cpt": "2", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 15, "uid": "b66b12f3-22f1-4497-a947-fb5fdf3ec6d7", "sentence": "Fabulous Unbelievable.

From reviews we had read we got the impression that this resort was great but not quite as good as its bigger sister at Landa Givaru and those reviews also suggested food was not great. We have stayed in many four seasons resorts about 7 now and have a very high expectation in terms of food and service and yet we really were blown away by this place. Before we get to the detail the short summary is that this resort was our favourite of the two four season resorts it has a level of service across the board that we just have not seen before and offers frankly the best of everything from the spa to the superb food outlets not only was nothing too much to ask but you never had to ask they pre empted everything it was phenomenal and they took the incredible four seasons standards and lifted them to an ultra level. Worth adding we were unlucky and had only one day of sun out of four days and still loved our time here fortunately we then got 6 days of sun at the LGFodTo be honest we were amazed with the quality of the food. The Grill served us up the single best steak and lobster we have had anywhere. The Kobe rib eye steak was simply divine and was the first steak I have had which could rival the Goodmans chateaubriand in London my wife who usually only eats fillet due to Ribeye being too fatty had it twice during our three day stay. My coconut creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e was also the best I have had anywhere it is a hard desert to make stand out so much. I could go on more about the food but think the above says it all you expect food to be good but do not truly expect a Maldivian resort restaurant to match the best London steakhouse or best London sea food restaurant needless to say the service was not only flawless but had an even more extreme above and beyond element than we usually get at four seasons resorts which was consistent across the resort. The food and beverage management team were very visible and did note that the menu was new in the grill and they have worked hard on it after previous failings at the restaurant and boy have they got it spot on this time. Breakfast was a beautifully varied affair with some fantastic additions like the juice bar where you could pick your vegetables and fruit for a healthy smoothie or juice. On my first day I had smoked salmon the manager noticed and said that the smoked salmon is not out every day so if I want it when it is not out just to let him know. We ate at Reef the Grill and the Indian restaurants and all were faultless. We did not try the Asian but it was very popular. At the sister resort we tried four restaurants and only the Lebanese restaurant was of comparable quality and we were slightly disappointed with the other food outlets. Accommodation We had a beach bungalow at KH and a beach villa at LG. The LG beach villa was huge and had huge outdoor space and a long 13meter or so pool. The far cheaper KH bungalow still had direct beach access but a smaller outdoor space and smaller plunge type pool. The style of the KH accommodation was actually a little nicer the actual finishing and build. although you could not complain about either very nice villas and so nice to have direct beach access. I am not a huge fan of overwater villas far more windy more of a potential issue in the off season and as there is no vegetation it feels a lot less private but it is down to personal choice and nothing is going to be less than amazing. Unlike hotel rooms I do not think having seen a good range of accommodation here that I had go for anything above entry level beach accommodation it is just not worth the big price uplift for additional pool and outdoor space or sunset vs sunrise sides of the island when you have beach access unles you have kids perhapsBeach PolBeach is stunning service is great as KH is a smaller island than LG you have beach service everywhere even directly outside your own villa at LG you had to move to Blu beach to get service or call in room dining. It felt very private and the snorkeling was great. Have to admit that the Kudha Hura can not compete with the Landa Givarus Blu beach most beautiful beach we have seen in the worldCostWorth touching on because a lot of people go on about how expensive everything is but when doing my own planning I did not really know what to expect. Drinks like cocktails are normal 5 star luxury hotel prices and we have seen city hotels charge a lot more. So around 15 to 18 which I did not think was bad at all although the weak pound did not help. Wine was a little more which is expected due to import costs and it being a dry country still better value that Dubai for example though Cloudy Bay S Blanc was 95 at KH 140 at LG. which for a 30 wine is 3 x mark up which is not terrible. House white was around 65 a bottle. Food they served the best quality everything so prices reflected that but it was the most noticeable high cost. We took the half board option which was fantastic no restrictions at all you just order off the a la carte menus like everyone else and the food gets taken off your final bill on check out. Dinner for two including one bottle of wine would usually come in around 400 500 we would end up picking up 130 of that for our one bottle of wine and service that is three courses and going for the more expensive food items like lobster and Kobe beef. We usually had in room dining for lunch it was not cheap. A tandori chicken wrap chicken wings hummus with pitta 6 pieces of nigiri sushi and two mojitos for lunch totalled 170 at LG. But the food was always faultless and you got what you paid for. Staff and ServiceBest ever. Every single person from the hotel staff boat crew managers beach staff and waiters waitresses were all incredible. it is hard to convey how quite how good it is. It was a very intimate approach and we felt like the only guests on the island from top management for both front of house and food beverage to the beach boys they went above and beyond to provide a personalised service. To noticeably raise the bar compared to the general fantastic four seasons service is quite something. Service at LG was also very good but not as good as here. Other thingsWe paid for the VIP airport arrival service CIP I think it is called and a private boat transfer all arranged for through the hotel. We were met at the door of our Emirates flight and driven off to a private terminal where our bags were brought to us and our passports were checked from the lounge. We were also met in there by the four Seasons staff who took care of everything. We were on the beautiful massive four seasons boat within 20 minutes of the plane doors opening. We were brought cold towels fruit platters and drinks during our 30 minute journey. Well worth doing after a long flight or for an extra special arrival. Criticisms Hard to find anything they set the bar a little too high at the start of our holiday and it meant the four seasons Dubai in particular felt very average in comparison.", "offset": [418, 885], "date": "2016-07-27", "cpt": "2", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 18, "uid": "08b07a26-fbbf-4d88-8f1f-ab04e25250d4", "sentence": "Absolutely Amazing Family Vacation. We just returned from our 5 day family vacation in October 2016. Our expectations were set high after reading all of the oustanding trip advisor reviews. Four Seasons Maldives at Kuda Hura did not disappoint. In fact every review that mentions the high level of service is absolutely spot on. It was the best vacation ever the resort is so relaxing with calm pristine beauty that just can not be beat by other locations we have been in SE Asia or the Caribbean. The outstanding personal attention and service along with the exceptional natural beauty of the sand and sea takes this resort over the top. The service started from the moment we cleared customs in Male waiting a quick 5 minutes with cold drinks before being whisked away to the awaiting speedboat for a quick 25min ride to the hotel and continued through our full 5 day stay all the way until we departed the airport to sadly head back home. Every where we went there was someone to help us ensure we did not need anything andor anticipate what we did not even know we needed. All of this was done in a non intrusive manner that is exceptional. We stayed in a sunrise family beach bungalow. The space was great including the separate room with trundle bed that was perfect for our two kids. The kids room had a TV with DVD player stocked with kids movies very helpful for a short distraction and sun free time to chill out at the end of day before dinner. The bathroom is huge large tub and both an indoor and outdoor shower. The main bed in the bungalow was a king and was awesomely comfortable. The private outdoor terrace out the back of the bungalow had ample seating for eating lounging or sleeping in the shade or sun right next to the refreshing small pool. There was a short path leading to the beach which was literally right there. It was great to be able to easily walk back to the bungalow if we needed to grab something else since it was so close. The beach had covered lounge areas with very prompt service kudos to Justin who took care of us on the beach daily with cold drinks and anything else we needed as well as enjoying entertaining our kids from time to time. One day after building a sandcastle we returned later in the day to a large pile of extra sand for the kids to play in. this was a great special touch as it had rained and the natural sand was a bit hard for our kids to dig in. Our kids enjoyed catching many hermit crabs on the beach along with the shallow and calm waters of the sea which allowed them to snorkel and see the aquarium that is the beautiful sea of fish and coral. It was amazing to watch them soak in the natural beauty. They also helped release a turtle into the sea after it was nursed back to health by the resort Turtle Conservation project. The food and drinks were outstanding throughout the day. Buffet breakfast at Cafe Hura is included daily with tons of choices both western and asian. We ate at the Reef Club Italian or Cafe Hura various cuisine for lunch and either Reef Club or the Grill seafood steak by the pool for dinner. All of these restaurants have fantastic service and high quality food that is truely top notch. We decided to opt for the full board inclusive of lunch and dinner. so we did not worry about cost of each specific meal. Every meal was very high quality and on par with some of the best restaurants we have eaten at around the world. You can tell that the food beverage staff is well trained and managed with high attention to detail. Each day they staff remembered our names and preferences. We especially appreciated Wasiu at Cafe Hura lunch and the Grill for Dinner thanks for taking care of us and our kids as they feel asleep in their chairs each night at dinner due to the jet lag. Also a special thanks to Sebastian and staff at the Sunset Lounge each night for great drinks fish feeding and hermit crab race. The food options for kids were great at all restaurants our kids at hot dogs fresh grilled catch of the day chicken strips spaghetti mac cheese pancakes eggs etc. Thanks to the staff at Reef Club for the special colorful tomatoes for my son who loves caprese saladIn preparing for the trip and location in the middle of the Indian Ocean. my biggest concern was my sons severe food allergy to nuts. I sent an email in advance of the trip to alert the FB staff. When we arrived at the resort the executive sous chef and one of the FB managers Henry was there to greet us and inform us that the staff was all aware and would make sure the trip was safe for my son. Indeed each and every meal we had breakfast lunch and dinner the staff knew who we were and that my son had an allergy. A few examples one day at lunch the meal was taking a bit long and the waitstaf mentioned that they were changing the oil in the fryer for the french fries for my son. One morning at breakfast a small box of chocolate muffins was delivered to my son specially made by the pastry chef free of nuts. One night at dinner the pastry chef delivered a piece of pound cake with nut free chocolate sauce so that he would have something extra special for dessert. If there was something not safe for us to share with our son they also reminded us of that. These touches and thoughtfulness were exactly what I was hoping for. I can not remember everyones name so my apologies for not mentioned how great everyone was your efforts were very much appreciated and ensured we had a great holidayThe resort is very kid friendly. When we arrived at the resort the first day they were greeted with special bags with their names filled with sand toys stuffed animals and a t shirt. Additionally one day the cleaning staff brought out a huge flamingo raft float for them to enjoy in the pool. The daily hermit crab race and fish feeding were highlights to look forward to after a long day at the beach and pool. Our kids enjoyed the Kids Club for an hour or so each afternoon after lunch as a break from the sun they did some crafts played with toys enjoyed the outdoor playground. While this type of vacation is not cheap it was well worth the splurge. We were hoping for a trip of a lifetime and we got it. We are now spoiled for life.

Our luggage was taken to our wonderful water villa whilst check in details were completed and then our holiday began. The staff were beyond attentive and yet discreet always willing to have a conversation to help one make the most of the times spent at the resort. The snorkeling centre was so helpful we do not dive and supplied us with masks and flippers for the duration of our stay. The reef just off the beach was perfect for our daily excursion with an array of colourful tropical fish without the necessity of a boat trip. We so enjoyed the crab race every night at the Sunset Bar I think we got as excited as the children. I think I may have felt a little sorry for the crabs on some occasions.

My husband and I first visited Kuda Hura in 202 when we lived in Singapore. We now live Europe and have been coming here every year since except when the resort was under construction after the tsunami in 204. We have travelled the world and lived in Asia and Europe and are lucky enough to have stayed at the best hotels in places such Tokyo and Buenos Aires and over 40 destinations in between. We have been to Mauritius Barbados Thailand and have tried other resorts in search of a place that compares to the beauty of the Maldives. Nothing compares. There is only place where you can literally take off your shoes and spend your entire holiday in an absolute state of bare footed relaxation. The Four Seasons Kuda Hura is our home away from home for my husband son who is now 8 and myself. 1. The Service Beyond five star. The team at Kuda Hura spends the time and takes the effort to cater to our every need. The big things one would expect and all the little details without our even having to ask. My husbands extra hot double machiato to my sons penne pasta with extra cheese sauce. Sebastian always greats us in the morning with the most lovely smile and the rest just follows. By the way the GM just asked me if I would like a home made salted caramel ice cream stick. Why not. I know I just ate lunch but how can I refuse that oferWe genuinely feel the team and everyone cares about our stay and how happy we are. The Four Seasons sets the standards here and to our mind worldwide. However the service can not be copied it is the spirit and the mindset of the resort that can not be bottled and recreated somewhere else. Faisal carved my sons name in a beautiful shell. Ashfan showed him how to cast. Joseph stops by at breakfast to see how we are and is our resort godfather so to speak. Randy the GM and his wife had us for dinner ostensibly a barbecue but more like a banquet. It sounds unreal and isI will just mention briefly that we were airlifted from Male in 204 after the tsunami. Our friends at another resort were stranded for 2 weeks. Only Four Seasons. 2. FodThere is a choice of three restaurants and room service. The food is unbelievable. We are used European standards and are big foodies. My husband is 63 and serious eater. Last night was the Easter BQ. Crab claws lobster a pasta station steak and frog legs quail. Yes barbecued quail. A gentle breeze and all the tables on the beach with perfect live acoustic music. Pinch me. Sameer and the team at Barubaru cook and serve world class Indian. Be prepared to overeat. My husbands favourite dish is the lobster curry. 3. Amenities and water sportsWe have been here for 18 days. Some of friends ask whether we get bored. Sadly no. The longer we are here the longer we want to stay. There is so much to do if one wants to. Complementary activities not to mention the amazing kids club I have read four books need I say more. Thank you Lisa and team. And adventures like big game fishing. We caught actually my son reeled it in. a wahoo and we had the most amazing fresh fish for lunch fish sticks for the boy and olive tapenade crust for us. Today we started with a scuba dive learned here with trusted equipment and expert instructors and dive masters Nazer thank you. Then watersking with Abdulah yes we learned here and my son skied in the middle of the ocean. Next year he wants to try mono skiing like his dad. Great gym never crowded. Snorkeling so much to see. The water is like a refreshing bath and clearer than Evian. Surfing. Donna and Cliff at Tropical Surf. True pros. Bored. Never 4. ChildcareSince last year my son runs around the island on his own. He loves the independence and has met so many other children. he will say hello to Didi and grab a fresh smoothie at the pool bar play ping pong go to their villa to hang out and stop by to see us at lunch and have an Oreo cake. He cried when we left last year. Our friends who joined us this Easter have a 4 month old and 2 year old. The childcare is impeccable as many of the caretakers have children themselves Shaheda is an amazing lady. They are more like nannies than babysitters my friend said. She has spent several afternoons relaxing in the amazing spa. Watch the fish through the glass window in the floor while you have a fantastic massage knowing that your children are happy and safe. There is a kidie pool and a gradual slope into the big pool which is perfect for young children. My son started coming here when he was 3 months and very water shy. Now he takes the ski bob out in the beachside ocean under the watchful and attentive eye of the water sports team led by Zahir Abdulah and Razak. So much more to say. We are sad leave and have decided to book Christmas. A year is just too long to wait and life is too short.

My partner and I holidayed here 24 28 March 2017. It was the best and most amazing vacation of our lives. From the moment we were met at the airport and taken to the Four Seasons Lounge there we felt that we were in very good hands. Even the hotel staff who met us there were super friendly and immediately made us feel welcome. The airport lounge itself is small but it is fine because you are not there for very long and there are soft drinks and snacks while you wait. The boat ride from the airport jetty to the Kuda Hura is short and pleasant. As the stunning view of the azure turquoise waters against the green islands take us further and further away from the stressful reality of our daily lives being on the well appointed boat that is all white with soft baby blue upholstery reminds us of the famed luxury of Four Seasons properties all around the world. As the boat gently comes to a stop at the hotel jetty the first things youl see are the wonderful thatched roofs of the structures of the resorts. You will also see the adorable spa boat that ferries guests to a tiny island where the spa is located just a short disatnce away. On the jetty you are greeted by the friendliest angels the staff of the resort who give each guest their warmest personal attention right off the bat. Their greeting is quite accurately Welcome to ParadiseCheck in is a breeze as you sit in the lobby that looks out to the jetty and one side of the beach and you are served cooling drinks and refreshing cold towels as they brief you about the property. My partner and I chose the Romance package for our holiday which included a romantic four course dinner for two at the Indian restaurant Barabaru. So at check in we were presented with the menu choices and wine pairing options too just so everything is ready for our dinner on the second day. Next we are driven to our sunset water villa one of the electric golf carts that ubiquitously roam the resorts and are on call whenever any guest needs a ride to and from their rooms. It would have been nice if we had bicycles to cycle around the resort but the hotel staff said it was not provided and that too may bicycles around the island would make it seem too busy and less idyllic unlike what paradise is supposed to be. He has a point i suppose. The water villa is a dream within paradise. Beautifully appointed the ambiance of the room was a perfect blend of island chic with modern luxury. The bedroom was perfect with a sumptuous bed and all the modern amenities you could ask for. I loved the reading nook that had windows you can open and jump out of straight into your private pool. On the terrace of the villa we also absolutely loved the over water hammocks from which you can see the fish swimming below you in the crystal clear sea water and we loved the whole setting of the terrace. If I had any improvement to make It would just be to provide a roof over where the outdoor sofa is placed so that you can still sit outside when it drizzles or when the sun is too hot and you still want to be outside but in a bit of shade. The bathroom was spacious with its own access to the deck terrace and the large bathtub also has a view of it and the ocean beyond. The toilet has a hand bidet which for me is absolutely a hygiene essential. The restaurants at this resort are all excellent and because the resort is aware that as guests there you are not likely go anywhere else for the duration of your stay they try to create variety by changing the menus frequently and by having different themes to liven up the atmosphere. We joined the beach side barbecue on the first night and had our romantic dinner set on a private thatch roofed gazebo of the Indian restaurant right on the water complete with a traditional music trio playing live music in the background. We also tried the Italian restaurant and bar which were both amazing. Daily breakfast at the main restaurant Hura Cafe is great with a wide range of local and international dishes available. I loved the smoothies and the asian noodles station in particular. Needless to say all the restaurants were priced on the high side. but then one would not be staying at the Four Seasons if one were too concerned about such things right. Perhaps the hotel should consider a dining inclusive package for guests who just want to have it easier and know everything is already paid for ahead of their arrival. just a thought. The thing that left the most impact on my partner and I however was not the rooms nor the restaurants nor the many activities that you can get into during your stay. What took our breath away was how the staff treated us. There was so much genuine warmth and caring that was evident in how each of them interacted with us. In particular I would single out Irene Johan and Renata who went out of their way to ensure everything went perfectly well for us. They are the embodiment of Four Seasons philosophy of treat your guests how you wish to be treated. When the time came for us to sadly leave this Paradise we had a late flight well after the hotels noon check out time. But Four Seasons Kuda Hura did what very few other hotels would do unles you are a regular or a platinum member of their loyalty program they gave us an equally beautiful room with a plunge pool. to stay at until our departure time at 9 pm from the Hotel jetty. And we are just firs time guests. How is that for clasThat made all the difference for me and I immediately knew then that the Four Seasons Kuda Hura will be a place we would be returning to annually year after year for many years to come. On a final note There was a small incident where I carelessly left cash in the safe of our temporary room and only realized it when I was back home thousands of miles away. I called Kuda Hura immediately but for some reason i was not able to get through. My partner somehow managed to find Johans social media feed and i sent him a direct message explaining who I was and what had happened. Within minutes he called me back on his personal line and assured me that they will assist me all the way. I then was in touch with Renata who was very comforting and assisted me very attentively until the matter was resolved and i received my money back with minimum hassle absolutely no extra charge. I doubt any other hotel in the world would have been able to do that with such ease sincerity and kindness. The Four Seasons Kuda Hura is in one word.

Our 9 day holiday at Four Seasons Kuda Hura was quite simply THE BEST. Having stayed at Four Seasons villa resorts in Bali Koh Samui we knew it would be something special but nothing prepared us for Four Seasons Kuda Hura in the beautiful Maldives. This was hands down the best holiday we have ever had. The resort built to blend into the natural beauty of this small island surrounded by the most beautiful sea in the world was a total delight for the senses. Kuda Hura \u2019s commitment to the environment is quite impressive from the complete elimination of plastic bottles from the resort to it \u2019s sanctuary for the rehabilitation of injured turtles. Our beach villa was beautiful and only steps from the sea. The villa \u2019s private outdoor pool garden was so lovely you could be tempted to forego the beach. The beautiful setting is a bonus but it is actually the people of Kuda Hura who turned our holiday into something way beyond special. They take such pleasure in doing all things large small to make your stay absolutely perfect. Nothing is too much trouble and any request is met with a smile. In fact very few requests were necessary because the staff seems to anticipate and offer before you can even ask. Housekeeping was amazing. They are at your service at all times and for the smallest request. Our housekeeper Shamem took amazing care of us. He is a charming talented man who brought smiles beautiful floral art to our villa each day. The resort \u2019s talented Executive Chef Vincent Tan is from Malaysia. When Vincent found out that we had lived in KL for 7 years he surprised us with our favorite Malaysian breakfast which he personally prepared. He oversees all of the restaurants in Kuda Hura and they are fabulous. You are really spoiled for choice when it comes to dining at Kuda Hura. Kandu Grill serves the freshest locally caught fish cooked over an open fire surrounding the pool in the beautiful Maldivian evening. The totally authentic Indian restaurant rivals some of the best in the world and definitely has the most delicious naan. The superb Italian restaurant has a fantastic menu of classic dishes including locally caught seafood. And finally Caf\u00e9 Hura the resort \u2019s main restaurant has a wide variety of ethnic western foods. This is also the place where you start your day with an amazing buffet breakfast. We can not leave out Sunset Lounge the perfect spot to enjoy a drink experience stunningly beautiful Maldivian sunsets. The staff management in these restaurants are world class and could not be more accommodating courteous efficient. In fact the management of this resort must be doing everything right. It is the staff who set the tone for any resort and at Kuda Hura it is quite obvious that these are very happy people. We had the pleasure to meet get to know Shamakh Yan two outstanding young Maldivian men who work in several of the restaurants. They are absolutely delightful. We will never forget the very special dinner they organized served for us at Kandu Grill on our last evening. We have run out of space to mention everyone by name but we want to say a big thank you to all the management staff at Kuda Hura for making our holiday one in a million. We look forward to seeing you all again at Kuda Hura in the coming months.

We stayed at this beautiful resort for my husbands 60th birthday. From the moment we arrived at the airport and were transported to the hotel to the moment we left everything was perfect. This resort is beautiful. The gardens are beautiful. We stayed in an over water villa that was pristine. As were the beaches and pools. The service here is incredible. Pitched perfectly with everything thought about but we felt relaxed all the time. Nothing was too much trouble. Yet we were n\u2019t troubled by too much intervention. But all the teams do n\u2019t miss a trick. Whoever you come across. My husband really enjoyed his birthday. The food here is also fabulous. All of it. We particularly loved the Reef bar restaurant a lovely location. The delightful Branca and her equally delightful team were welcoming and presented us with marvellous food and wine. It \u2019s so difficult to get all this right but at this resort they have managed to tick every single box.

It leaves my eyes weary when we were on the boat leaving the island as if the time being spent there is not enough especially when the staff sending another farewell at the corner of the port until we were out of sight. Well known as a luxury property around the world the staffs at Kuda Hura are an exceptional one in delivering their heart for our stay. Every staff is sending their sincere warmth in any interactions and always anticipating our needs or wants. This is an additional luxury that we experienced apart from its \u2019 well handcrafted interior villa and very well maintained for it is cleanliness and it is features we stayed in the land instead of the water vilaAnother interesting spot in the resorts is the kids club. Kuda Mas. It is well set up interior design with beautiful oceanic mural and Alice \u2019s in Wonderland theme and their intensives activities is very interesting and educating to embrace the creativity and positivity. I would love to spend my whole day there if I have more time to stay only to retreat my childhood memories. I love the most is the staffs \u2013. well what comes from the heart you must have feel it that they love what they do. From few properties that we visited in Maldives this resort is one that very friendly and fun for the kids to stay. Enjoying our meals with exquisite foods is another experience that we embrace very much. We have no wonder though as we know that the team is being led by a famous world class jury in culinary so that we know we can always expect to the best. We \u2019ve spent a lot of long hours in restaurants and the bar just for a very well mixed cocktails and great views to the shore that we just realized that we have a very good time there not only enjoying the foods and drinks but also to reconect to each other. Moreover the staffs are accommodating our requests very well and very amiable that we feel more like friends with them \u2013 it is a casualty that comes with their professional manners and behaviors. Love. Love. LoveMy highlight for the stay is the water activities \u2013 as I am a very amateur water sport person. Gladly it is designed for any level of difficulties though. Usually I will be skeptical about the safety and all yet to my surprise I really enjoyed them all snorkeling kayaking swimming with turtles. I missed to have the dolphin activity due to my nap \u2013 too bad. Most of it I love their turtle rescue program. how they educate us to have more awareness and responsible for the life of the species. They have a great preparation and presentation before we start our activities that make us feel safe. I will start to snorkel more now. Too bad we have n\u2019t tried the spa though we heard that they are famous for the massage and therapy sessions. I think we spent too much time in the villa for napping and resting. Walking around the island is fantastic that we love the atmosphere and the smells around the island \u2013 it is flowery smells. The most memorable thing that I \u2019ve never experienced before is that on our last day we \u2019ve been taken to the Back of the House tour where we can go inside all of the staffs area the kitchen restaurant to knowing how our breakfast pastries and all the foods drinks supplies are being manage stored meeting with the staffs in their duty as well to the water processing room and electric generator area as well being introduced with their waste management program and much more that we can not see as a guest. All is to give us the glimpse of how they are running a teamwork to maintain this beautiful property for us. I feel overwhelmed and full of gratitude at the same time to understand all the hardwork they do to ensure that we are well being taken care during our stay. Such a great amount of work to make everything happen with great level of quality of services. I feel so blessed to know all of this and leave the island with more appreciation to the staffs. Knowing that I should explore more of the activities in the island though I would love to explore other resorts in Maldives for sure I will go back again to Kuda Hura. I would love to say thank you to all of the staffs there because I love the wonderful experience I \u2019ve had it there.

This is going to be a difficult review. Why. Well how much praise how many compliments and how many excitement can you put into a tripadvisor review without repeating the words fantastic outstanding exceptional or one of its kind all the time. After our fourth time at the Four Seasons Kuda Hura from which we just returned home a collection of superlatives are certainly what is called for. We are a family of five with three relatively young kids 7 55 and 35 and from the moment we stepped through the doors at the airport in Mal\u00e9 to the second the doors of the seaplane closed for our transfer to Landa we felt papered and spoilt 247. Starting with a special pick up with the resorts 55 Princess yacht from Mal\u00e9 and the very warm and personal welcome on the Jetty by Randy the general manager things seemed to still improve almost by the minute if this was possible at alA great number of staff are with the team for a very long time some apparently for as long as 20 years and this makes this resort truly unique and very exceptional. Everyone recognised us again from the first moment on and people took a keen interest in what had happened in our lives since our last stay. This was not customer care but true personal interest something very special. Whilst we unfortunately may be unable to list every encounter and may fail to praise each individual there are quite a number of persons we would like to commend and thank for their exceptional warmth and generosity. Rao in particular together with Didi Adam and Brian at the Sunset lounge and on occasion at the main pool bar where otherwise Athens was taking excellent care of us always has a smile on his face and some wit ready. We were treated to some very special cocktails including an evening of drinks on the most kind and generous invitation of Maximilian and Giovani and every sunset we watched was more special because of the team there. In addition to Randy who always stopped by to say hello whenever we met somewhere in the resort Giovani Maximilian and Maxime were the most perfect hosts one could wish for. Always on the lookout for our boys and ready to read every unspoken wish off our minds we felt extremely privileged by the personal attention you extended to us. When a crab race yielded both a price for our youngest son and a major crisis in the face of their loss for his older brothers you were so kind to have emergency prices ready for them. The evening was saved. While the Reef Club is currently undergoing renovation the team have set up a Reef Bistro on the main pool island. Logisticaly quite a challenge because the food needs to be prepared in the main kitchen behind Caf\u00e9 Hura and carried over there. this is a fantastic spot and the perfect location for this alternative. The menu has been reworked slightly and become even more delicious than we remembered. Branka and Nano have been incredibly kind to us together with the rest of the Reef Club team and when I tried in vain to find my favourite Tiramisu on the menu the only response was that the chef keeps a few portions for special guests. minutes later I was back in my Italian sweet dreams Another highlight on the dining side was the re introduction of the full buffets for the special nights which we had missed the year before. This time we could again feast both on the occasion of the Indian night in Barabaru and the Maledivian night in Caf\u00e9 Hura. In addition to the special dinners and our nights at Kandu Grill one of the most memorable moments was our breakfast on the first day Nishan had remembered my wifes love for mangos and the moment she set down as well as on each day thereafter a giant plate of freshly cut super sweet and fantastic slices of mangos appeared out of nowhere needless to say without us mentioning it a single time. The boys fell in love with Rajesh and Nishan in particular but to be completely fair we would actually have to list everyone at Caf\u00e9 Hura a truly fantastic team at work here. When you have read this far you could think that all we did was eat and drink. Not so and also on the sports side we have had a number of highlight moments Ilham introduced our oldest son to diving last year and so maybe it was only natural that this year for his 7th birthday top of the wish list came diving lessons with Ilham. Seeing his older brother put on the scuba gear also our middle one could not resist and found the perfect match in Mousse for a brief introductory round in the main pool leading straight into the sea the next morning together with his brother. Clive Samy introduces the whole family to surfing we had a blast. As did Holly presumably who was kind enough to take photos with our camera. Must have been a great sight we assume a great sight which also Maximilian benefited from while waiting on the main jetty for guests to arrive. Unnoticed by us he took a delightfully lovely photo of the entire family on the boards but rather than just emailing it to us he had it framed and put up in our room in Landa where it awaited our arrival. Imagine our surprise it was like coming home for us. Finally after more than a decade of pausing I had decided to re start playing tennis just before we went off to the Maledives and I was determined to make great progress. Hashef the pro took this with a sporty smile and exhausted me to a good degree while always cheering me on and working on key elements of my technique. A true hitting partner and the hours we spent on the court together as well as the talks around them were among my most treasured moments. Every Wednesday the management reception takes place at the Sunset lounge and while this may sound a bit formal for an outsider it was only this time we fully realised what a wonderful occasion this is to speak with a great number of staff in private on a variety of topics. It resembles more a family barbecue than a reception and as we noted to Randy after this years reception it is wonderful that the staff take the time for this. My particular thanks to Ahmed for our discussion which I most thoroughly enjoyed. So what can we say. There is no other place like Kuda Hura.", "offset": [2890, 3126], "date": "2019-07-24", "cpt": "4", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 29, "uid": "9dbd865b-6137-4711-9742-72342338f490", "sentence": "Heaven on Earth. This will be a long review so if you want the executive summary just do it. Do n\u2019t look at any other place in the Maldives just book this. Ok. so now to the detailed review. There is n\u2019t anything this place has n\u2019t thought of so I \u2019l try and cover off via my personal story of my stay. Arrival. Don\u2019t let the name \u201c Male international airport \u201d fool you. It \u2019s hot and basic. But it \u2019s all good Four seasons has you covered you can wait in the comfort of their private a c waiting room stocked with cold refreshments and snacks but do n\u2019t get too comfortable the boat is being prepared and you \u2019l be whisked away shortly. The boat ride is very quick aprox 15 mins. You \u2019re welcomed on arrival and provided the most refreshing welcome drink ever it actually needs to be on their mocktail listWhilst waiting in reception I happened to wander into a section to the left which was full of tanks with turtles of all ages. Confronted by a larger turtle Moxa clearly desperate to get out of its confined pool. I had an instant crisis of conscious how can I stay in a place that feels this sort of confinement is aceptableAle came out and I quickly asked her the purpose of this set up. it \u2019s a turtle rehabilitation center. Crisis averted. I then spent a good 30 mins learning about all the current patients and the great work they do. Incl satellite tracking of one turtle which was recently released currently swimming in the waters off Sri Lanka. Ale can I get an update on Moxa pleaseThe acomodationI was fortunate enough to experience both the over the water villas and beach bungalows. Both are exceptional my preference was actually the beach bungalow. Being over the water is an amazing experience however it can get a bit noisy at night if the tide is coming in. And if you do n\u2019t sleep well and have a vivid imagination as I do one may find themselves getting up in the middle of the night to check the villa has nt started floating away. The accommodation is exceptional everything has been covered. You have accidentally got sunburnt. no worries fresh Aloe Vera is provided in the room. You forgot your adapter. no worries all the wall sockets are set up to accept any international plug. Fresh water complimentary and not a plastic bottle in sight. All refilled glass bottles truly enviro conscious. You want to listen to your music whilst outside on your verandah. no problem the Bose portable system connects to your Bluetoth. The beaches. Both the sunrise and sunset side of the island provide picture perfect turquoise clear blue waters. The beach chairs are super comfortable. And the staff at the beach somehow know when you have arrived and will be delivering iced water and a refreshing cold towel before you \u2019ve set up your beach chair. It would be remiss of me to not point out a couple of critical points. 1. Take note of the strong current signs. They are not there for decoration. I m an Aussie who has been in the water from an early age I am a strong swimmer and beach aware. And I got caught badly. Due to pride I swam across it to get out of it but by the time I dragged myself out onto the beach I was exhausted. 2. Black tip reef sharks are alive and well and likely to be swimming past you. These sharks are actually harmless. But nonetheless it can be quite discombobulating to be swimming snorkeling and have a shark casually swim past you. And do n\u2019t think you need to be out deep these guys come into the shallows. Oh and if you \u2019re phone happens to run out of battery whilst you \u2019re on the beach which could very easily happen given I was never without WiFi service on any part of the island indeed one of the party I was traveling with binged watched an entire season on Netflix from the comfort of her beach lounge no worries each sun umbrella stand comes equipped with an international power socket. Food barsBreakfast is fabulous and if you have dietary restrictions they will bend over backwards to accommodate. There are a number of restaurant choices I tried them all and they are all great. My favorite was the grill. Fresh seafood cooked Maldivian style. The Grouper grilled is the bestThe sunset lounge is true to its name. Comfortable lounges chairs great music fabulous cocktails and the sunsets are magic. Every evening they hold a hermit crab race which sounds kitsch but it \u2019s quite funit is pretty the prices are in USD and are ex taxes etc. and if you are on AUD like I am then it makes for an extremely expensive experience. But in my opinion its worth saving up for and splurging. GymThe gym is very well equipped and the cardio equipment is depressingly newer than the equipment in my home gymServiceI\u2019ve saved the best for last. the personal service is one of the best I have experienced. Everyone somehow knows who you are and they anticipate your every need. In my view the service is what sets this property apart not withstanding everything else I \u2019ve describedAl the workers from the buggy drivers to the Gardeners greet you as you are walking throughout the property. It can get exhaustingEnding this review with some special calouts. And I know I \u2019m going to miss some people and for that I apologize in advanceFirstly. a special shout out to Maximilian for rescuing a damsel in distress for organizing my return visit so promptly and for not laughing at me as I regaled my woeful tale but rather nodding empathetically with true concernTo all the restaurant staff special shout out to Joseph Kiki Sharef Ashfan Sebestian and of course Ali breakfast was n\u2019t the same on the last morning your day off. Thank you for looking after me. Harsha thanks for encouraging me to take the flippers would n\u2019t have got out of that current without them. Nazer for letting us burrow some gear from the surf shop. Koki your gift shop is one of the best resort gift shops really unique stock and I love love my sandalsDina at reception thanks for your warm welcome and farewell x2 and especially for my welcome drink when I leftI will treasure my Kuda Hura memories forever.

Even when compared to other Four Seasons the services here are outstanding. If you are into water sport this is a great place to be.

We recently stayed at the Four Seasons Kuda Hura for a week to celebrate my wifes special birthday and take in some time in the Maldives for a beach holiday. I have gone into a fair amount of detail in this review as a Maldives holiday is a big decision. But for quicker reading the summary below helps. If you are looking for a beach holiday that surpasses your expectations in every way then the Four Seasons is the perfect way to do it. It goes way beyond the luxury of the property itself every person goes out of their way to ensure you are having the time of your life. every minute of every day. We arrived as guests and left as a part of the family. Beyond the physical amenities and the incredible gastronomy of this resort what makes it truly special is the staff. Without exception everyone we encountered went way beyond our exepctations of a top class resort. it is very clear that this is something they pay attention to and everyone is personally accountable for making that magic happen. We had several opportunities to observe the team at work and what stood out was how that management team remained visible and active whether it is helping with daily duties no matter how menial or interacting with guests during each meal and during the day. If there is one thing that sets this resort head and shoulders above the rest it would be this. This is not our first stay at a Four Seasons property but it is by a large margin our best Four Seasons experience to date. ArivalWhile the airport itself is nothing to write home about the Four Seasons experience begins once you are through customs. We were escorted to a Four Seasons lounge and could relax while our luggage was transferred to a speedboat. The transfer to the resort then takes about 35 minutes whereafter you are welcomed to the resort by the management team. Villa style AcomodationWe stayed in two different villas the sunrise water villa and the sunrise garden villa. Both rooms are incredibly luxurious and I think it is a personal preference as to which view is preferable. The sunrise villas are identical to the sunset equivalents but on the opposite side of the island. Our rationale was that the best way to enjoy sunset is with a cocktail in hand meaning we would be watching it from the Sunset Lounge. we are happy with our decisionWe enjoyed having the 2 different rooms. Unles you are certain of your preferences opting for a few days in each is a good idea. Just remember that you are then packing up your hotel room mid way through your stay but the luggage transfer process happens seamlesly behind the scenes. Villas are spacious and sumptious. Each had a super king bed generously sized TV which you should never need Bose sound system complimentary Nespreso and tea making facilities and walk in closets. The bathrooms are amazing double basins supersized bath as well as indoor outdoor showers. The private pool is indulgent and lovely. The outdoor area around the villa has at a minimum sun loungers a day bed under a gazebo and a general area to enjoy the sun. Rooms are serviced twice a day as can be expected in a property of this category. But what I appreciated most was the attention to detail. Normally evening turndown focuses on just that the bed and a pair of slippers. At Kuda Hura I noticed how outside towels were refreshed clothes were neatly folded and one evening my book received a Four Seasons bookmark too. Pools and public areasKuda Hura is located on a fairly small island which means everything is in easy walking distance. Grounds are immaculately maintained. In addition to the private pools at each villa there are 2 main pools one of which is for adults only. The all access pool has a swim up bar perfect for when the need cocktail now impulse kicks in. Sun loungers are available around both pools and on all beaches. These areas are serviced which was welcome. And every few hours someone does a tour of duty with a smoothie or ice lolly of the day. The final daylight hours are best enjoyed from the Sunset Lounge near the lobby great cocktails with an amazing view. Alternatively the Reef Club bar is an outstanding alternative. The cocktail menu is limited but the team will make absoutely anything you prefer or will get creative when you ask them to. WiFi is offered throughout the resort including on our boats to and from the airport. Unles you pay extra it is adequate for email and messaging but not really video calling. RestaurantsThere are 4 restaurants on the property. All are excellent. Some nights offer a fixed menu while other nights are a la carte. I had recommend you spend a little time planning your evening dining when you arrive and make sure you try to get the right blend you are looking for. Breakfast is a lavish affair with a wide variety of global options. We enjoyed venturing beyond the full English into some of the oriental options on offer. You can expect to see a full selection in continental buffet cheeses cold meats fruits etc. The pastries offered each morning are out of this world expect to find several varieties of croissants danishes muffins doughnuts and other goodies. Eggs waffles and pancakes are cooked to order. A highlight for us was the juicing station also freshly prepared. Lunch is available at 2 restaurants. Alongside the adults only pool is Reef Club which offers Italian cuisine. You can expect fresh pizza pasta salads fish and the like. Portions are generous so consider having a starter and mains to share. The calamari is a winner. Alongside the larger pool is Cafe Hura where the breakfast area is set for lunch. Expect to see more international options on the menu. The highlight included fresh fish of the day and the lobster crab pasta. Presentation is superb and food is excellent. For dinner one is spoilt for choice. And every option is excellent. The Kandu Grill is an upmarket grill expect to see red meat fish and shellfish. The Reef Club transforms into an upscale Italian bistro overlooking the pool. Barabaru offers some of the best Indian food around. Finally Cafe Hura offers a more international menu complemented again by fish and shellfish. I had suggest you try them all you can not make a wrong choice. Every night were were overwhelmed by the selection. In particular the fresh seafood bought from local fishermen is moutwatering. In all restaurants for all meals presentation is world class. Portions are generous by European standards but it is worth indulging in at least 2 courses. Your waistline might not thank you but your tastebuds most certainly will. The wine list is generous and the selection by the glass will not disappoint. In addition the team can make any cocktail you choose. For the birthday evening we decided on the private BQ for our 2nd night at the resort. If you are looking to indulge this is the perfect choice. The team had created a private dining area on the beach and we had a dedicated chef and server for the evening. As for the food. some of the best sushi I have ever had made from locally sourced fish followed by shellfish fish and tenderloin. Dessert was equally impressive. Hint. if you opt for the BQ make sure you arrive hungryFitnes RecreationThe 24h fitness facility is generously appointed with weights and a good selection of cardio equipment. Sunrise yoga is lovely. Being an island there is a great selection of complimentary and paid for watersport activities. There is a lovely area on the sunrise side of the island for snorkeling which was always teeming with wildlife. We used the kayaks on the sunset side and were fortunate to see quite a few stingrays in the shallow water. The excursion to the western side of the athol to take in the turtles is well worth the time. Whatever your preference there will private or group activites to suit. Being in the Maldives it is essential to take in something to observe the marine life and the Four Seasons provides amazing options. Taking some time out when you arrive to plan any activities is well worth it as not all activities are available every day. SpaThe island spa for which the resort is renowned was being renovated while we were there. Temporarily the Four Seasons team had built Garden Spa which occupied a few of the garden villas. We thoroughly enjoyed their signature massage but opted to spend most of our time on the beach or around the pool. Environmental PolicyI was pleasantly surprised to see the steps being taken to reduce environmental impact. In particular bottled water still and sparkling is made on site in reusable bottles. Also shower gel and shampoo do not make use of plastics. The Four Seasons also plays host to one of 4 turtle rehabilitation centers in the Maldives. They run education programmes for kids and adults and have a team dedicated to protecting this important species. Finally the hotel supports a coral regeneration programme. it is not news that that the Maldives has suffered from the impact of coral bleaching. This tragedy is also evident during snorkeling. But the positive impact of the programme is also visible. We enjoyed spending time with the team to hear about their programmes and it is clear they appreciate the support of the hotel too. Special MentionsFinaly the resort hosts a behind the scenes tour. If you are interested in seeing how the magic happens this is well worth the 90 minute investment. I found the scale of operations astounding. Clearly the resort does not have city conveniences and yet still have to provide a first world experience. And that takes a lot of work. I was able to observe the staff dining facilities the engineering facilities including power generation and water desalination and finally the food storage preparation and kitchen areas. Clearly providing a world class dining experience where you require military style logistics is quite an endeavour. And it has to be matched with a team that can prepare everything on site. And that includes a bakery that operates 21 hours a day. And FinalyAs mentioned above the stand out is the entire team and how well they work together. To experience it as a guest is very special indeed. There are a few folk that stand out to us in ensuring that our experience for 1 week was truly a slice of heaven on earth. These are Razaq in the Recreation team Amito in the restaurant Danu the resident cocktail magician the servers Mohamed Das and Rajendra Branka Maximilien Giovani and Joseph. Aflah and Tamil deserve special mention too for ensuring our BQ evening was so incredible. And these are just the names we could remember but should not be viewed as a slight on those we do not immediately recall.", "offset": [8201, 8298], "date": "2019-11-24", "cpt": "4", "category": "reception"}]}
