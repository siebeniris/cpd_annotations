I was sent to Portsmouth for a 4 day conference training for work. I was to stay at the Renaissance Portsmouth Norfolk Waterfront Hotel. WELL I am extremely elated to tell you I wish I got there sooner. I was greeted by the most professional staff anyone could hope for. Even thought it was late night the clerk insured I knew where to eat within 5 minutes walk. I was on the 11th floor and she made sure I had a view. And it was a spectacular view particularly in the evening with the sunsets. 121. I took in one eater and was just as described by the clerk. Oh and she called to the room a few minutes after I got in my room to ensure all was ok I like the view and to ensure my comfort was cared for. Exceptionally clean room wonderfully appointed beds coverings. The only thing lacking would be a in room vault. The bath was oversized and I enjoyed the shampoo of Rosemary and Mint. Plenty of towels. The indoor pool and whirlpool was a great way to start the day. Wonderful deck here looking out on the ship building docks. 104F in the whirlpool and the pool was at a perfect 78 degrees for swimming laps to get in the morning exercise. There were large clean towels a on every station point. This is directly next to the work out area which was clean bright well equipped and for once ALL of the equipment was operational. The bar scene was very nice and the staff so willing to please. The Last call was not just shouted out but the lead bar tender made his way around and ensured everyone there had an opportunity to put in their last order. The bar food was excellent I did find that eating a table top to be better then at the bar. The bar is massive. I was also pleased to find that the parting garage had a height restriction of 10 feet and was well lighted and very clean. Further I found delight in the fact that the lady vacuuming the carpet made it a point to stop as I approached introduced herself to me and I her. She asked where I traveled from and how long would I be there. She was smiling warm friendly and told me that should she be able to make my staff better she would be delighted to help. If you smoke there are many well appointed areas outside for this. Just past the wonderful fire place nice to sit next to on those cool knights. When you return from you day out and about you are greeted at the front with cookies refreshing iced water lemon lime fresh fruit. What a nice way to come back from a day of toils.

The do not disturb sign was out until around 1 pm on Wednesday and 10 am Thursday. Several members of our convention had their rooms given away to locals who also had events in the hotel. The front desk actually told them to ask other guests if they could stay in their rooms and then sent the people with confirmed reservations to a hotel all the way out by the airport forcing them to pay for taxis to get back in for the convention. Friends told me that housekeeping came into their room and emptied the trash and left towels but did n\u2019t make up the room. The restaurant was completely unable to handle their own dining room and had to make a special shortened menu to try to keep up and even with a four item menu it still took 20 30 minutes to get served.
