It is connected to a small indoor shopping mall. On each occasion we were upgraded to a suite due to our Platinum SPG status. Two of the suites had a full bathroom with a separate second powder room in the entryway. This second bathroom comes in very handy when traveling as a family. Each of the suites was very nicely appointed and well kept. Toiletries as is true of the entire chain are quite lovely. The white tea fragrance is delicious. We have purchased these toiletries separately through Saks Fifth Avenue because we like the scent so muchThe lobby leaves a bit to be desired. Although it is beautiful in rich woodwork decor one must take an elevator from the street entrance level and then a second separate bank of elevators to the room. This is a little unusual but not overly burdensome. During each of our stays formal affairs were held in the second floor lobby area nice to observe but having to plow through a room full of tuxedo and ball gown clad attendees with luggage and children in tow is a bit of poor planning. Complimentary breakfast due to Platinum status was sufficient. The full breakfast menu is available but only upon asking the server who seemed to be doing us a favor to offer it as such. The restaurant area is somewhat dark and not very welcoming.

Hotel is fine once you get into the lobby. I kind of judge everything based on a Disney vacation and this room was priced like it was on the monorail but without the perks.

Someone put a sticker like you had have to take off a shower gel to use it and stuck it to the shower wall. It was there upon arrival and was still there 3 days later.

That said the desk staff offered us a great deal of additional Starwod points if we were able to check out by 100 am which we did because they were hosting 5 weddings that weekend. it is a big hotel.

If you are a business traveler in for a quick overnight skip this Westin. it is pricey and the service is subpar. I am a frequent Westin guest and this one location had inexcusable service issues. On the surface the hotel maintains a great facade ornate lobby festive bar and a convenient downtown location. However the Philadelphia Westin is distinguished by its abysmal room service and lack of responsiveness responsiveness. I could chalk it up to a one off hiccup but the experience still leave me confused. I arrived late 9 pm for a brief stay and meetings downtown the next morning. For the business traveler an iron And ironing board are rudimentary tools for any hotel. The Phily Westin is the first hotel I have stayed at without an ironing board in its roms. Perhaps this was an oversight but I can not imagine that the prior guest stole it or that a shortage kept one from being stashed in my room. A call to the operator was met with a right away. Twenty minutes later 100 by now the operator said oh yeh. Another 30 minutes ticked by before the ironing board was delivered. I do not mean to sound petty but it is like a Hotel overlooking soap since maybe you will not wash during your stay.

I booked my stay hours before arriving at the Westin but upon arrival was told that no reservation had been made. After spending nearly an hour in the lobby contacting Expedia and waiting for them and the hotel management to sort things out my reservation was finally confirmed. I had recommend calling ahead to confirm your reservation regardless of what your itinerary states. Then after coming back in from enjoying the city nightlife I was rather turned off by the nonexistence of any vending machines or nearby places to grab snacks for late night cravings. Yes there is a minibar but 5 for a can of soda is a little much. I understand I was staying at the Westin but even so the variety was limited in the minibar. Also the hotel does not take cash payment. Having a card on file for incidentals is one thing but to be unable to pay for the nights with cash is a little odd. The room was really nice the decor was comfy and the amenities were satisfying. Overall I enjoyed my stay but did run into a few hiccups headaches that blemished my once sparkling impression of the Westin. I recommend double checking reservations before arrival bringing your own snacks unles you are comfortable with the high minibar prices and do not rely on cash. The room and common areas were nice. I liked the big 65 4 K TV in the room. Bed was a little firm but still very comfortable. Located in the heart of Center City with plenty of shopping food and nightlife a short walk away.

My boyfriend and I stayed at the Westin Philadelphia the weekend after Christmas for two nights and our room was broken into room 802 next to the elevators. We realized it a couple hours after we returned to our room that day after receiving a notification from my credit card company that my card had been used at a few stores in the area. I had not actually taken that credit card out of the hotel room at any point so we checked through the rest of our stuff and realized that my boyfriends laptop had also been taken. I am shocked at how the Westin staff and Mariot corporate has handled this situation over the last month. At no time has the fact that our room was broken into actually been addressed. It took weeks of follow ups phone calls and emails to get any kind of response from anyone which was ultimately that they will not be able to help us. We immediately reported the theft to the hotel staff and after about 15 20 minutes a security officer and the Assistant Front Desk Manager Christopher Fries came to our room to take a report. He let us know that we could speak further with Karim Ware the Director of Guest Services the next morning. Throughout our entire experience with Karim he was flippant and unprofessional and clearly had no interest in concern about or sense of urgency with this entire situation. Each time we followed up with him for an update we were told that he would be getting in touch with us after a few more days. Each time we did not hear back from him so we again had to follow up. We were also told that Westin would be conducting their own investigation into what happened and although we have asked multiple times for the outcome of this investigation and for surveillance footage our requests were ignored. I also emailed Mariot corporate about this and about two weeks later I received a response from Debra Camperud a Corporate Liaison of Consumer Affairs with the frankly laughable excuse that the hotel is simply not responsible for thefts and that was it. Again my request to have the outcome of their investigation was completely ignored. The morning after the incident Karim said that he ran a report of the electronic key card activity for our room and that our door was actually left open while we were out. I find this extremely difficult to believe. I work in the travel industry and travel quite often through the US and South America and it is engrained in my travel habits especially in cities to close the door tightly behind me. We also were sure to place the Do Not Disturb sign on the door before we left because we did not want housekeeping to enter and since a housekeeper was right outside our door when we left we checked the sign and the door again before leaving. Karim also told us our door was ajar again later in the evening when we were in the room and had already called security to report the theft. I was there looking at the closed door waiting for them to arrive so if the door was ajar it is very obviously a problem with the door not functioning properly. Chris the first manager also commented to us that our door when closed seemed off like there was more of a gap in the door than there should be. I can only assume at this point that this was an inside job that an employee of the Westin knows that their doors are faulty and took advantage. You need a key to get to the 8th floor and what is more interesting is that my credit card was taken out of my wallet and the laptop was taken out of a bag and both were closed back up and put back where they were. Whoever did it clearly wanted to be very subtle and did not want us to immediately notice that anything was missing. I do not know if the staff at Westin is trying to protect someone or what but the complete lack of concern on Karim and Debras part is just unbelievable.", "offset": [58, 214], "date": "2020-02-02", "cpt": "1", "category": "facility"}, {"id": 18, "uid": "e97871be-b4ad-45c3-923a-d8ef85e04b15", "sentence": "Tired Facility.
