And I stay at a fair amount of standard mariots. The hotel and rooms were very nice modern and clean. The front desk staff were efficient and friendly. The bar was a good place to enjoy a meal. Staff at the bar were very good. But the hotel had several short comings that knocked the rating way down. First my bathroom had warm water not hot. It was a two day stay and would have complained but thought it would be a one day anomoly. Not so had to bathe and shave without true hot water. Next the workout room was tiny and all of the cardio equipment was in use. Had to wait. Again if a longer stay would have complained and asked to use a local gym. And finally one night I had a headache and needed aspirin. Asked the front desk who pointed me to a closed gift shop. The front desk did not have a supply of aspirin that is poor.

We decided to take our three children to the Dallas World Aquarium for the weekend. When we arrived at the hotel the staff at first was very friendly. However when we went to our room it was nothing what they had listed. We were supposed to have two queen beds with a sleeper sofa that was not the case. We recieved two standard beds and that was all. We contacted the front desk to discuss that this is not what we reserved and were advised there was nothing they could do. We contacted expedia about our complaint unfortunatly they were able to help us much either. Expedia did credit us for a future reservation but we were still stuck with the room for the next two nights. Since our room can only acomodate 4 people we had to make a mad dash to get bedding for one of our children to sleep on. Our trip to the Aquarium was amazing. There were so many birds animals and aquatic life it felt like we were in a mini rainforest. The entire facility was well designed with many nooks and cranies having exhibits tucked in perfectly. After our visit the kids wanted to do some swimming and i wanted to soak my feet in the hot tub. To much of my dismay the hot tub was a flower garden. After swimming with the kids for awhile we decided to head back to the room. The pool towels were just mere bath towels. Needless to say our trip was a little of a bummer but had a blast at the aquarium.

I was looking forward to staying at this hotel. Location on the map looked great. That was the best part. it is all downhill from there. Location in front of a lake with relaxing views. We had a room with a lake view and balcony. In the balcony there were 2 cheap looking chairs not very inviting. We checked in early. The hostess cheerfully greeted us and said our room should be ready in 12 hour so we waited in the patio area. It was a nice sunny albeit windy day. So it was a good way to de compress after a long drive. The balcony lake view room is the largest disappointment of all. It felt old and dated. But worst of all it was FILTHY see pics. It must have been a while since housekeeping dusted and cleaned. We even found an ice bucket with melted ice behind the balcony curtain. I was not able to take a pic of it but my husband said the phone cord was coated with dustSince I was there for business and only staying one night we decided to stay put. But never again. We would have been better off staying at a hotel 12 the price they charged. Pros views covered parking garageCons construction in the area old and FILTHY romTo bad really. this could be a great hotel.

My husband and I chose this hotel for our anniversary because we had stayed in this area at the Omni before and really thought it was nice. I booked the reservation online and I requested a king room with a balcony and a water view. In the notes I put that I wanted to have the highest floor possible. I downloaded the ap and went in the ap to find that they had changed it to a king room on the lowest floor available. I called the hotel to find out why it said that and they were not sure but said that they would book me on the 10th floor which was the highest they had at that moment. He said that we could see if there was anything higher the next day when we checked in. I put on the reservation that we would check in at 3 PM. We arrived at 330 PM and went to check in and I told them that I would like to see what the highest floor was available and they told me that it was the ninth floor. I told them that I was booked into a 10th floor room the day before and they told me that they did n\u2019t do that. it was the reservation agent that did that. I explained that I did not call the reservation line I called the hotel direct and they then said that the 10th Floor room was not yet ready and was still being turned. I asked him why it was not ready as I had informed them that I would be arriving at 3 PM. They told me that they could send a message to have the room expedited if I wanted to wait. We had Dinner reservations so I wanted to get checked in so that we could start getting ready so we opted to just stay with the 9th floor even though that is not what we wanted. When we arrived in our room we looked around to find that the room was very average. It is your basic bed and desk with a TV room. The balcony was large with a table and 2 chairs which was nice. We noticed that there were no robes or any other amenities that were listed on the website. Nothing was going the way that it was planned. When I asked about the robes I was told that they are something that they do not offer to everybody and that they have to be requested. On the website these amenities are listed as a room amenity it does not say that they are upon request. At this point I was truly frustrated and just not wanting to stay at this hotel. I went downstairs to let them know that I wanted to check out and just cancel my whole reservation. They informed me that if I did cancel that I would still be charged. The supervisor came over and was interested in helping make things right. She found a room on the 10th floor that she expedited to have cleaned and she had all of the amenities that were missing delivered to that room. She also went above and beyond and sent additional amenities to our room for our trouble. She definitely wanted to make sure that we had a good experience. We went to the room on the 10th floor only to find that it had a very small step out balcony. There was not room for a single chair much less a table into chairs which is what were in the other room that we had. I called downstairs and another agent answered and I asked if our original 9th floor room was available and I was told that it was not. I was told that the 5th or 6th floor where the highest floors available at this point. I went downstairs to speak with the lady that was helping me and she said that the 9th floor room was available. She gave us the keys to that room which is where we stayed for the night. Again the room was very average so if you \u2019re looking for a luxurious room then you will not find it here. It has been updated and it is modernized but still average. We stayed at the Omni three years before and it is very nice and luxurious at that hotel. I do not see us going back to this hotel but I do appreciate the efforts that were put forth to help us have a enjoyable stay.", "offset": [171, 263], "date": "2019-07-29", "cpt": "1", "category": "room"}, {"id": 17, "uid": "ddd2e314-1f89-44a3-8549-cd61d20a897d", "sentence": "The view of the waterway was very special.
