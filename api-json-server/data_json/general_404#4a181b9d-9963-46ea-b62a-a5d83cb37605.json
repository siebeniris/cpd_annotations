Early Saturday afternoon we were enjoying a peaceful and relaxing day with our children in the pool area of the San Juan Hotel I requested two plastic cups with ice at the bar near the pool beach area Jenifer the waitress that was attending me was questioning in an uncomfortable attitude what my use for the cups with ice were for and that I was not allowed make personal drinks. I said it was not for mixing alcohol she was hesitant but proceeded to give me the cups. When I return to my lounge chair and pored my 3 year old daughter and nice juice I was immediately confronted by security personnel. The security guard said he was informed by the waitress that we were consuming personal alcoholic beverages. The security guard personally saw me pouring a juice pouch and the two girls drinking from the cups so he left. Later on that day we requested the menu from the bar because the kids were hungry and asked for pizza but the pool area did not have pizza on the menu we saw signs posted on the trash bins that it was not permitted to consume food or beverages from outside we asked the waitress not Jenifer. if we were allowed to purchase the pizza from the pizzeria in the hotel lobby to consume near the pool she replied that we were allowed because it was purchased from inside of the hotel. We also asked the employee in the pizzeria before ordering and they said yes it was allowed. When we got to the pool area and began to have lunch we were confronted once again from the same security guard and was over looked by an undercover supervisor from a distance he said that we could not consume anything not purchased from the pool bar we told him that we had asked and that since the pizza was purchased within the hotel not from outside we were told by hotel staff it was allowed. He said that that was incorrect that we can only consume from the pool bar and that we had to go to our room or to the beach to eat the pizza. He apologized for the inconvenience and said that it is the bar staff that complains because they do not make any tips when it \u2019s not purchased from them. We told the security guard that we were there to have a good time with our family and did not want to cause any problems so we left to beach to eat the pizza with the kids under the scorching sun because it was a charge of 10 for an umbrella and we were just going to have lunch and return to the pool. Afterwards in the pool area the kids slept on the lounge chairs and we adults stayed looking over them from the edge of the pool. I walked over to make sure the girls were ok and was intercepted by another security guard. I was baffled for the third time because now they say we could not have the pizza in the pool premises I told him that we were feeling harassed and explained all the previous encounters and that we had eaten at the beach and that the box was leftovers he replied that he knew about the situation and that to avoid problems we needed to take the pizza box to our room or throw it away because the bar staff was complaining. What was supposed to be a relaxing and fun vacation weekend with the family became a very unpleasing and uncomfortable nightmare from bad looks from the pool waitresses to constant harassment from the security personnel. It seems like the hotel is focused on maximizing the profits of those areas rather than focusing on guest enjoyable and relaxing stay.", "offset": [734, 845], "date": "2015-08-04", "cpt": "0", "category": "general"}, {"id": 2, "uid": "b19e0b94-8ec3-4afb-ae78-7f1fcd0c167c", "sentence": "Worst experience of my life please excuse my grammar my English is not so great.

BY SURPRISE. an extra 35 a day on the room bill at check out. The room ended up being not such a great deal anymore especially considering we were placed in the WORST room right next to the elevator shaft. Upon arriving we noticed a terrible vomit like smell coming from the fridge area. We told one of the maids but nothing was ever done. We noticed the TVs LCD was broken and gave off a weird greenish glow that made it hard to watch the very few channels avaialable of TV. Nothing was ever done about that either. The day before my birthday a bottle of white wine appeared on the desk with a happy birthday card. Sweet sentiment from my brother and sister in laws. I called them to thank them and they said it was supposed to arrive the following day on my actual birthday. We had to keep re filing the bucket with new ice until the next night to be able to enjoy it on the day of. The day of my birthday a cheese plate was sent to the room with a card simply reading Garel. We thought it was from a new friend we had made at the casino the night before. It was actually from the same brother in law who has similar letters in his last name but Garel is a far cry from what his last name is. We did not find out it was from him until 2 days later. The first night we went to Meat Market and were made to wait 10 minutes by a rude up ety hostess who said she was unsure she had be able to seat us. Upon finally being seated there were at least 6 tables free. So rude. The 200 meal was subpar. The rude treatment was just adding insult to injury. Later at the casino we were gambling. It took 30 minutes for someone to come over and take drink orders then another 20 at least for the drinks to arrive. When I had finished my drink I tried to flag down the drink guy for another one and he LITERALLY rolled his eyes at me and walked away. Other guests saw this and told me it was typical of the drink service at the casino and that they too were super put off by the mans rudeness. We told someone at the casino and he finally came around 15 minutes after he was spoken to but rolled his eyes as he took our drink orders and when he finally came back with our drinks held out his plate and glared at us waiting for his tip. I gave him 1 but everyone at the table told me I should not have done that and told me they stopped tipping on the first day because he was so extremely rude. I ended up leaving and going elsewhere for drinks. Too bad they would have made a lot of money off me at the casino had they only been actually friendly and attentive. Remember that bottle of white wine I mentioned. I tried to bring it with me on my birthday to drink it polside and they told me I had to take it to the beach where outside drink was allowed. I told them it was a room service bottle but they still were rude and made me feel really bad and made us go sit out by the beach. Happy birthday to me. Thanks Hilton. Also we were charged 52 to our room service bill for that bottle that my brother in law PAID FOR ALREADY. We never even ordered room service for ourselves so it is not like it was a silly mix up. Were they trying to get away with double charging usWhen I just called to get things sorted out on the phone the lady who picked up answered with such SASS and ATTITUDE. Again thanks Hilton. Such terrible service rude people poor attention to detail and sheisty billing practices. Very dissatisfied and disappointed.

Key points. definitely worth talking with someone from the hotel in advance of trip re rooms. I worked with Marisol via email to ensure the details of adjoining rooms etc. and she made it happen. something an online site could not provide. She was really accommodating and responsive. We booked the bioluminescent tour through the company on beach that does parasailing etc. Again the personal service was like we had a family friend giving us a tour. He actually picked us up himself in the company Mercedes van and was an extremely knowledgable cultural well read well educated and funny guy. Talking during the 1 hour ride was actually fantastic. sunset in the mangroves was unbelievable and though pricey it is worth it for the total experience we had as a family. memories and laughs galoreUpon arrival Eric Roldan made everything seamless. When only one room was ready he had us in there and alerted us when the second was ready. When we needed extra keys a roll away bed even mailing something that I forgot to send and he even called the room later in the day to ensure we were all settled in and satisfied. I felt like he was giving us extra personal service. Only negative about the rooms is that there are no balconies or outdoor seating from the room. We had a door to open but a balcony would have been ideal. Some breakfast days were complimentary b c of our Hilton status however the breakfast buffet is confusing not clear what is continential and what is more. Also we purchased full breakfasts even when we did not need a full buffet b c we did not know nor were given menus for a la carte options. It was fine but even w the sign at entrance it is confusing. THE HIGHLIGHT of my meals throughout the entire trip was actually a breakfast cake I had one morning. I asked our server Maria a gem of a girl. what kind of cake it was sort of a cheesecake with a cream middle but a million times more delicious. She had several other guests also complimented it she said. I asked her to tell me the kind of cake and who made it. SHe said it was made from scratch not a mix and it was called vasco cake. The baker was named Yavi. I never met the baker but I asked for her name to write here. I highly recommend that she gets some credit by mgmt for being so creative and for the most scrumptious morning treats I have ever seen. I would love to get that recipe. Some other points around the corner from the hotel is a grocery store that sells wine beer and alcohol plus snacks. It makes things convenient to have a drink at the room without having to go downstairs all the time. We did get a free cocktail pass for the first night but there was a huge fashion expo the time we were there and the lounge was overrun by fashion week gurus. We felt underdressed going there b c of the busy trade style show going on. The BQ up on the top floor is open for dinner not lunch. The pool directly out front is quiet and family oriented. The pools closer to the ocean are more social lively and pool side cocktails. Service for food and drink was slow this time but was very responsive on our first visit. The cleanliness was evident throughout the hotel. I saw hotel managers in the hallways while room cleanings were happening. Everyone was smiling and with a kind word. We were literally from airport to hotel room to pool with pina colada in hand in less than an hour.

Service inside at the reception bars and stores were not always friendly or helpful. Rooms were nice and spacious and well cleaning only a few minor points which can be improved. The bed is large and VERY comfortable. And be aware prices of the drinks and restaurants are way overpriced. Better to eat somewhere outside the resort. The biggest disappointment was there way of handling certain situations. Our credit card got declined and instead of kindly asking us to sort this out security came to our room to escort us to the reception. Not only is this really rude but I felt ashamed like I had done something wrong. Another things is that the room cards often get deactivated when you have it too close to your phone for example which in my bag happens sometimes. We were on the 8th floor and every time this happened we had to go down elevators take a long time. and up again very annoying. Once we went down and the reception send us up with another employee to help us. However when we got to our room he said we did had to go back no idea why. so we had to go up and down up and down.

I have stayed in many different countries with Hilton and I have to say that this was the most terrible experience that I have had so far. The lack of customer service was beyond awful except for a few people. Here is a daily account of what I had to deal with Day 1. I had to wait for 7 hours the first day I arrived to be put into a partially cleaned room there was still a pair of pajamas from a previous guest behind the toilet in the bathroom. I was told to check back in hourly to see if the room was ready and while I arrived at 1 pm a room not the room I was supposed to be in was not ready until 830pm. Caira was extremely rude about the process. This was the beginning of the bad attitudes that I would encounter here. They acted as if you were bothering them or inconveniencing them and were rude curt and disgruntled. The only staff members that were polite and helpful were Kariely Marisela Yaisa and Yvone. Customer service is seriously lacking at this hotel. Day 2. We ordered room service. I ordered an egg white omelet with spinach and another vegetable a kids order of French toast sticks and eggs scrambled with cheese. We received an egg white omelet with cheese French toast sticks with no fruit cup and eggs scrambled with NO cheese. We left for the day around 230pm and at that time there were about 4 cleaning carts on the floor. We returned to the hotel around 130pm 9 hours later to find that our room had not been cleaned the food from earlier in the day was still there and we did not have fresh towels. There was NOT a Do not disturb sign on the door because our room did not come with one nor did it have a menu. I had to borrow one from housekeeping. Day 3 We noticed that the air conditioning unit in the room had leaked causing a huge water bubble above the entrance way. We notified front desk and they sent someone to take care of it while we left the hotel for dinner. When we returned to the room the water bubble had been burst and towels left on the floor. No one took the time to contact housekeeping or get a mop or anything to finish cleaning up the leftover water. Instead we were forced to walk on wet towels that were just left on the floor. Eventually Marisela was able to move us to another room which is the room we stayed in until we left. Day 4 Continental breakfast was included in my room rate. I went downstairs to grab breakfast and ate a mini croissant at my table. I went back for another which I wrapped in my napkin to take with me as we were leaving early for an excursion and the staff in La Teraza restaurant started screaming at me that I was not allowed to take food out of the restaurant. They would not let me take a coffee to go as well even though there were to go cups located right next to the coffee machine. Then I was presented with two checks and when I attempted to explain to the woman that it was included she rudely told me to sign it and that it would not show up on my bill. I crossed an X through one and signed the other. What happened I was billed for a continental breakfast as well as a buffet breakfast anyway and neither me nor the person who was staying in the room had a buffet breakfast. We decided to go to the Italian restaurant for dinner as the entire trip was to celebrate my friends birthday. After we order and received our appetizers a girl in our group noticed a small roach on the table. She killed it with her napkin and notified the staff which in turn told her she was incorrect and it was just a mosquito. She then cancelled her order for her main dish as she was completely grossed out. No one came to wipe the table afterwards no one apologized for the insect or tried to rectify the situation. Instead the staff told her how she was wrong instead of trying to make things better. On the last day I spoke to Yvone which would have been the third managerial staff person that I had spoken to in 5 days. I spent more time at the desk trying to correct things and make my stay enjoyable than I did with my friends vacationing which was the entire reason why I was there. Based on this experience I would tell all of my friends who are planning to take a trip to San Juan to choose somewhere else to stay. it is not worth all of the aggravation and continued disappointment from a staff that obviously does not enjoy their job or want to be there helping customers.

The staff are undeniably the best characteristic of the hotel they are attentive courteous friendly and gracious. They make your stay 100 better. Also the renovated rooms are a big improvement. I always feel safe in the area. With that said upon arrival we learned two key pieces of information that impacted our stay 1. there is no longer a casino and 2. everywhere you go outside of property lines there are protesters with microphones including about 10 feet from the pool chairs. On the third day of our trip the hotel won a suit against the protesters prohibiting them from using microphones which minimized the disruption however without the music that the hotel blared during the day. they were still relatively loud and annoying. The prices for drinks have almost doubled since the last time we were there which was disappointing especially compared to prices at the Ritz and the Intercon nearby. Part of this iconic hotel is the salsa dancing that happens on weekends. From what I understand the hotel has discouraged locals from coming to dance which was the best part of the night. There was still a crowd on Friday and Saturday but nothing like it used to be. Considering there were only two restaurants open one of which is horrible Marea the drink prices have doubled and you can not walk around the property without listening to protesters they have quite a nerve charging what they did per night for a room. With all of this said they have a lot of work to do to get back on track with this classic hotel. While I do not intend to visit again in the near term I will continue to track their progress and consider returning in the future in years.

The rooms are very nice and clean. I had booked an oceanfront room but it was more of a pool view than anything. The ocean was obstructed with the palm trees. Nice view of the pool but not he ocean which is what we wanted and paid extra for. The beds were a bit too hard for us but pillows were nice. The bathroom door is terrible. Management please do something about this. The doors are sliding doors and it was so hard to close at one point my daughter pushed it too far open and it got stuck so it was a process to slide it back.

We left in an hour and came back roughly around 10 pm and our room was not cleaned. We were so upset because we were expecting to walk into a clean room and clean towels to shower before bed. These rooms do not have balcony so drying clothes is a headache. We would lay the clothes near the window to get some sun but this was a huge inconvenience for us. We had the hotel buffet breakfast. It was ok but definitely not worth 23 per person. For a family of 4 it was a lot of money for breakfast so if you are not a big breakfast eater save money and go somewhere else. Pool service was very nice and I loved how the servers and pool beach area cleaners were nicely uniformed. The workers will set up the chairs and umbrellas where you want them on the beach. The beach was very nice and warm. A lot of seaweed the first day but then the next time we went it was clean. Decent hotel but I am not sure if I would stay here again.", "offset": [29, 87], "date": "2017-08-08", "cpt": "1", "category": "general"}, {"id": 17, "uid": "163b531a-e31e-4aba-a9fb-1df06c8656ef", "sentence": "We had been to the hotel just a few years ago and had received wonderful service.

This hotel is so beautiful and has so much potential \u2013 but it has a long way to go for the service to match the interior and exterior. ProsThe hotel grounds are beautiful especially the lobby. We loved walking into the lobby and just looking at the ceilings and the detailing. It truly is amazing. The pool area is gorgeous and lovely to lay out in. The beach is beautiful and pristine as is the water and the beach access is super easy with service to the beach. Mara who checked us in and Yvone who I had reached out to ahead of time were both very helpful. We got a free upgrade and checked into our room early and checked out an hour late \u2013 both were very appreciated as we had odd flight times. The lobby is great at night. We loved the live music and watching the couples salsa dance. We just sat and watched for a while and enjoyed it immensely. The pool bar is great with nice hours 1am6pm. Others have complained about the towel check in and check out but we had no issues and found it very easy. The location was pretty ideal \u2013 15 minute cab ride into Old San Juan 45 minute ride to the rainforest and some nice restaurants in walking distance. We felt very comfortable walking around at night and exploring the area we are two women in our 20s. Everyone was bilingual which is helpful for those of us who are unfortunately. not The rooms are nice and fairly quiet. We could hear some construction in the morning but it did n\u2019t wake us up or bother us at all. I had read other reviews about construction noise but did not find this to be a problem. Cons. The biggest con of this hotel is the service. We consistently had issues with people being either unhelpful or nowhere to be found. It is a real issue with the resort which confused me because it is one of the easier things to fix. These are a few examples. All are really small little things that do happen. In isolation one or two would not even be a blip on our radar. But just consistently every single day we would turn to ask someone for help and get frustrated that it was not forthcoming. I have never stayed somewhere where I felt like I could not rely on a front desk for help or advice but that was how we felt here. After checking in we went to the pool area. It was the 4th of July and the hotel was extremely busy. There were no chairs at all so we put our stuff down and swam. We went to get towels only to be told there were n\u2019t any and to come back in 15 minutes. No problem. But when we came back in 15 minutes we were told we had already missed them and to try again in 15 minutes. I explained we had already come back and how do we make sure we do n\u2019t just keep missing them. The woman at the towel area told us we could grab a chair and she would bring them \u2013. but I had to explain that there were no chairs we had looked and been putting our stuff on the floor to swim. The woman said we could hang out nearby and she would make sure we would get towels as soon as they came out. We did stick around and 15 minutes later when I realized they were handing out more towels I finally walked over. When I asked if the towels had come out the same woman just said \u201c Oh. Yea \u201d. and handed me two. Our first day the forecast said it may be a little rainy drizzly. We asked a man at the front desk if Old San Juan would be okay if it was rainy overcast weather. He said probably not. I then asked if he had suggestions for rainy day activities and he said he did n\u2019t really trust weather reports. Again I asked okay but if it does rain what do you suggest. He had no response and had no suggestions. Later the next day we went back to the front desk to ask about renting a car. We spoke with the same man. We asked the best place to rent a car and he recommended we go to the Enterprise across the street. I asked if they had cars \u2013 I had checked and they did not online. He then checked and said oh no they do n\u2019t. I asked where else could we rent a car. He said our other option was to take a cab to the airport and rent from the Enterprise at the airport. I asked about other rental options in walking distance \u2013 he insisted it would be best to go to the airport and go to enterprise. I do n\u2019t know if the hotel gets a cut or a kickback from Enterprise but there was no way I was going to take a cab to the airport just to go to enterprise when there were multiple other car rental options in walking distance that was cheaper I ended up renting from Charlies Car \u2019s finding them much cheaper online. But there was also an Avis in walking distance. I was sitting by the pool and asked one of the servers pool attendants for ketchup for food I had ordered. All he said in response was that \u201c it comes from the kitchen so it is going to be a while in a curt manner before walking away abruptly. We rented a cabana one day which comes with a fruit plate. A simple fruit plate took about 30 minutes to arrive. We did n\u2019t have a hair dryer in our room so I called the front desk to ask for one to be brought up. It was n\u2019t and I called again a few hours later before we finally got one. This happened agin the next day \u2013 we needed something in our room fixed and we called in the morning and it never got fixed. We called again a few hours later before it was finally fixed. The food is not great and is absurdly expensive. 21 for a continental breakfast of bread and oatmeal this was included in our Costco package otherwise we would not have eaten breakfast at the hotel. The lunch options at Cana were not great and very pricey. We avoided eating at the hotel as much as possible and never ate dinner there. We preferred places nearby \u2013 especially the small beachfront restaurant a few minutes down the road. As others have mentioned eating and drinking here is absurdly expensive and we spent as much time doing both off the property. As others have also mentioned their go to line is that they are full or at capacity. When I asked the front desk originally about checking in early I was told they were completely full and it would depend. Looking online they have many different room types still available to book. Yvone when asked about checking in early easily accommodated us which I appreciated it. But the front desk was dismissive and seemed to just parrot back the we are full we will try line no matter what their actual capacity. I was told the same thing about late check out but when I pressed it was not a problem. I booked this through a Costco package and got a great rate. For what we paid it was fine. The grounds were beautiful as was the beach and we used the pool and beach access a lot. I would not spend the for the regular rate.

The rooms are just the right size. They are very clean and have been updated. The grounds are spacious and well kept. The four pools never seem crowded. Just beyond the pools is the beach. On the beach chairs and umbrellas are provided. Waiters are there for drink and food orders. The staff was the best I have ever encountered. Everyone was polite courteous and helpful. They did everything to make my stay enjoyable. The breakfast was great. We had the buffet. Well worth the money. Just about any breakfast offering you could want. Dinner offerings were adequate. We ate at the steakhouse one night. It was only okay. The restaurant was nice. The staff excellent. The food is nothing like a Ruth Chris or New York Sirloin. it is more like a Longhorn steakhouse with Ruth Chris prices. I probably would not do that restaurant again. All the other restaurants were great. One more thing. I had forgotten my razor and asked if they had one at the front desk.
