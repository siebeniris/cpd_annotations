The room is a little unique with hard wood floors. Bathroom nice and crazy bright with a light surrounding the mirror. Floors were warm and cozy and fixtures are nice. Beds comfy and warm. Work desk decent simple but very functional. With lots of power options throughout room. Also an outlet next to each bed is a nice touch. Fridge available under TV and a coffee pod system. But machine already had water in it and I did not have a way to flush it. Not knowing how long it was in there or who put the liquid in there concerned me a bit.

A good thing about an older building is that there was a balcony that we can step out for fresh air. I had an issue with the laundry facility it was out of laundry detergent and because it is run by a different company the hotel staff could not help. The front desk was pleasant but reluctant to break down a bill into small changes so I went to a nearby bank to get coins for laundry and tip. We will bring lots of coins and laundry detergent next time. The location was great just off the highway and a mall with a nice food court was nearby.

We booked a room for 2 nights at the hotel as we were in Kitchener for a family wedding. Two of my brothers were also at the hotel and were given rooms closer to the front of the hotel in the tower portion of the complex. My wife and were given a room room 132 much more expensive than my brothers rooms way down at the back part of complex. Over the course of the late afternoon and early evening it appeared that lots of party type people were starting to arrive in our wing of the hotel complex which is quite far from the rest of the hotel. Between 1030 pm and 110 pm I had to call the front desk twice to complain about people yelling screaming in the hallways and doors slamming up and down the corridor. On the first call I told them I wanted to be moved. They said the hotel was completley booked up and there were no available rooms but that the manager was on the way down. She never showed up and the noise continued. I called back. I was assured that security was on site and on their way to handle the situation. Again no one showed up. By 115 I had to get dressed and walk down to the main desk to get some action. The manager on duty had no clue what I was talking about. His security person was standing at the front desk. I walked back down to the party wing with him. At that time he started to knock on doors to get people to setledown. That seemed to have worked for the first night. On the second night we arrived back at the hotel just after midnight. It was mostly quiet. I was pleasantly surprised. Well that did not last too long. Between 10 am and 230 am the shuttle bus arrived back from the Kitchener Waterloo Oktoberfest celebrations. I knew this because you could clearly hear people yelling in the hallway that the Oktoberfest bus is here. Woho. After the first night I spoke to the front desk people who pretty much patted me on th head and said everything would be fine on the second night because security was on site and would handle any disturbances. In short not impressed at all for the over priced rate I paid and being dumped in middle of a large group who had clearly come to party and that managment gave no consideration after I repeatedly complianed about the disturbances.", "offset": [134, 266], "date": "2017-10-08", "cpt": "1", "category": "room"}, {"id": 12, "uid": "a459dad1-7921-48a2-aee7-3cef620538ed", "sentence": "A very comfortable stay at Holiday Inn Kitchener.

Made a wrong decision when I decided to book a room at The Sunbridge Hotel Conference Center in Kitchener Holiday Inn still do not know what it is was not listed as a Holiday Inn on website even though their receipt has Holiday Inn heading. It was one of the worse experiences I have had at a hotel. Not knowing weather or not it was a Holiday Inn or a Sunbridge was my first mistake and also thinking it would be a nice place to stay was my second. The problem started the morning of August 15th when we went down for the breakfast I had paid 20 extra for. Thinking at that price it would include bacon and eggs and toast but what we received was totally pathetic. It was very small with cereal stale bread stale pastries a few slices of roast beef and a couple of other meats that tasted disgusting along with a few cubes of cheese and small servings of yogourt. Upon our arrival we were informed that there was no wifi available which was no big problem and they mentioned breakfast would be served up until 930 and we would sign for our breakfast but failed to mention that the kitchen was under renovations and that it was a VERY limited buffet. When I checked out I complained about this and it fell on deaf ears on top of that I was NOT charged the amount that I signed for or that what was CONFIRMED on my reservation. The reservation confirmation stated Room Rates Starting 08142019. CAD 1240Subtotal CAD 1240Total Tax CAD 2108Total CAD 14508 But when I got my receipt my credit card was charged 15332 again falling on deaf ears as they added more taxes than stated on a confirmation which is false advertising and I have contacted the better business bureau about this matter as the front desk agent would not listen to my complaints and was very rude and uncaring that I was so frustrated by that time I walked out I did not ask to speak to the manager again it probably would not have helped. I found this hotel not forthcoming with their problems and not willing to refund the extra money that I had paid for their so called 22 dollar breakfast. I really wish I had of kept my reservation at the Quality Inn where I have stayed before and they actually had a great breakfast well worth the extra money but they include it in their rates.
