We stayed here for 3 nights and these are the issues we encountered with the hotel1. The very young female on reception where we checked in was hard to understand and did not speak loud enough to fully hear what she was saying2. We had asked for Non feather pillows at the time of making the reservation. When we went to our room we had feather pillows on the bed. We then asked for them to be removed. After around 40 minutes still no one came. We rang up again and asked for the feather pillows to be removed and finally someone came. However the pillows they bought to replace the feather pillows were unusable. They were flat and hard and disgusting. We could not use them3. Our bed had not been made properly. We spoke to the maid about it and he immediately agreed that it was not made right. The sheet was not even big enough to be tucked under hence when you move around at night it all ruffles up. We then asked for that bed to be totally remade and asked if we could have sheets that were not like plastic. The first set of sheets we had felt like plastic and were noisy. 4. The first night we could hear very clearly the plumbing next door and it made a whistling noise that was disturbing every time they turned on a tap or shower. The sound proofing also at this hotel is non existent5. The location of the hotel is also noisy regardless what side of the hotel you are on. There is not any double glazing and even on the 16th floor very noisy so we had to try and use ear plugs6. The restaurant at the Sheraton I do not believe anyone that goes out a lot and is used to property good food could honestly give a positive review on the restaurant. The buffet we tried first and it was shocking. They make you peel everything and pick around with seafood which is not what everyone is wanting to do to have their clothes and their hands stink but this buffet did not really provide any seafood that was already prepared. We thought the other food on the buffet was like bistro food. The next night we tried the a la carte. We basically could not eat it absolutely terrible. The rojan josh was tastles rubbish the fish was shocking. We went somewhere else for dessert. And we had to ask for proper red wine glasses as the ones they gave us were some cheap little glass you would take on a picnic. A place like this should have proper large red wine glasses as this is common practice when drinking red wine. The lady did go and get some proper red wine glasses but each time at the a la carte and the buffet we had to always ask for proper red wine glasses because their normal ones are not appropriate for red wine7. We did not think the staff displayed much common sense. A couple came in with a very young toddler and the staff proceeded to seat them right next to some people at the restaurant. The toddler was yelling and walking around. The thing was there were plenty of other tables available a distance away and those tables stayed available the entire time to seat this baby. But instead the staff just put them hard up against another couple. We thought that showed the staff had absolutely no idea. it is not the fault of the restaurant that there are inconsiderate parents who take out a little toddler and expect it to sit quietly we accept that there will be parents who ruin other peoples special occasion however the staff should be very aware and seat that couple with the young child away from the already seated couples especially when there were numerous other tables yet the staff sat them right next to the already seated tables. Sheer inexperience and incompetence. 8. When we checked out we do not like the way The Sheraton automatically puts a donation on your account. it is not the money its the principle. Yes of course you can have it removed but really who is going to stand there and hold up other people who are in line behind you. We think if the Sheraton want to make donations then they make that donation out of the massive amount of profit they make each year and not have the guests make the donation and then take the credit for it. The Sheraton have been doing this for years and it really is wrong. To conclude there is nothing outstanding about this hotel. This hotel is without a doubt set up for non speaking or limited speaking overseas tourists who stay and never come back. This is probably where it gets its business from. For Australians who live in Australia and just in Sydney for a stay this definitely is not the hotel you would want to use. It is quite apparent it is for overseas tourists who would not probably be returning back to Sydney and also it does cater for local conventions that hold their conference there.", "offset": [2724, 2848], "date": "2016-05-21", "cpt": "0", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 7, "uid": "9ed9db5b-8984-458e-8119-95201e5cdc41", "sentence": "Great luxury city stay.

Stayed here on a Saturday night some things were great but others were a little disappointing. First the great location is fantastic. Directly across the road from Hyde Park one minute from David Jones nad Pitt St mall. Everything you could possible want to do in Sydney is a short walk away. The room I got a corner room facing the city not the park was good sized well appointed black marble massive bathtub. I was impressed with the good ventilation and the King size bed was so comfortable. Everything from the bar and restaurant all looked fantastic. The pool was amazing and I even had a great sauna. Now to nitpicking what I did not thing was so great. Reception were not that welcoming she told me my room was not ready and she would rive me a ring on my mobile when it was ready no more must admit I did get there before 3 pm. After 1 hour I asked and she said it will not be much longer. Tied of waiting I went to give my bag to be stored only to be told by the bell hop that my room was ready. Thought the girl at reception should have given me more options that just wait for her to ring. Missed out on the lunch and ended up eating in David Jones instead. I also found the other staff to be a little stand offish and unprofessional often joking with each other or talking like they would in normal conversation. Maybe I am old fashioned but I expect staff in 5 star big name hotels to talk with more respect. Not like I would talk to the Queen but I hope you know what I mean. Finally for breakfast I had cold bacon and eggs. Coffee was good though. One thing I though was funny was that there were condoms in the minibar the action pack. Was tempted to take them just so when asked anything from the minibar. I could say just the two condoms with a big smile.

I did find that service could be somewhat patchy. An inoperable safe was reported straight away to reception. They forgot to mention this to maintenance and I had to follow it up.
