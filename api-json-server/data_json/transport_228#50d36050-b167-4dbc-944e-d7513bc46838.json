Check in is friendly and efficient and if you have friends waiting there is a place to sit. That and you can ask the concierges for great tips about the neighborhood and beyond. it is difficult to stay on top of all the changing restaurants bars and clubs but every time I have been there they have been spot on. The rooms are spacious and airy. All the glass makes not only a good view no matter what room you have but the sun exposure is terrific. Although this is across the street from the Moscone Center I have stayed here a few times and none of them have been on business. One time was with girlfriends. This is centrally located for nightlife shopping nearby bars. We could walk to places and back. Another time was a romantic getaway. Again we could cab to restaurants on Nob Hill and North Beach in minutes. One time with children that is always the true test of a good hotel.

Since SF is every travelers go to place at one point or other I booked this place for its indoor pool and luxury. There are tons of budget hotels in SF as well as number of top of the line places. This weekend a room here was decently priced for its amenities and location. Checking in was not too bad. The person checking me in was super sweet. She informed me that as a IHG member I do not have to pay for WiFi which was super awesome. My downloaded videos will have to wait. LOL. My kids were delighted as we were expecting to be unplugged during our stay. The pool was heated so even I was able to get in and get some lap swim in the morning. It was a little crowded for my liking but I am sure everyone had the same idea for November vacation. Get a hotel with indoor pool. Great thing we did since it was 30s to 50s in SF with high wind and rain. Now with this kind of weather my only complaint was that our heater did not work. We really should have called the front as soon as we realized it but it was like 9 pm for a one night stay. So we just withstood having just fan and did not bother with the engineering call. I thought this would be my only complaint. But the next morning was Sat morning and guess who did not get to sleep in because housekeeping insisted on coming in. She knocked and rang the door bell multiple times and I was pretty pissed at this point as my husband took the kids to the pool so I can sleep in a little longer. I am super sleep deprived so I do not get why housekeeping had to come at 9 AM ON THE DAY WE CHECK OUT. She realized I was in and left. However she DID NOT COME BACK TO CLEAN MY ROOM. SO WHY DID YOU WAKE ME UP. It was not even worth waking up if she was not going to clean up. Obviously SHE MADE A MISTAKE. NOT ROOM LADY. I called her back to complain to her about the heater and she called engineering who did not show up at all that morning probably knowing that we were going to leave anyways. I am really surprised that high end hotel would have issues like this. Housekeeping also did not pickup the night before for toothbrush delivery. I had to call the front desk which happens often past 9 pm. But once they were called via front desk someone showed up. So I am hoping at least management sees this to rectify the problems for other hotel guests. The room with no heater is 1823 by the way. However the fan works fine.
