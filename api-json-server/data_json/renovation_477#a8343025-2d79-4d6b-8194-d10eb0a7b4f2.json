The OGrile is not open although they are grilling sandwiches and provide seating outside. One of the outdoor canopies is closed and appears to need construction but no construction was being done.

Well I must admit that I was very concerned about this place before my trip. Some people loved it and some others loathed it. How can there be such a discrepancy for people staying at the small place only a few days apart. In my opinion its all about expectations and understanding what this place is. Is it a five star hotel where you are pampered in the lap of luxury. No this is nt that type of place but then again it never sold itself as such. The Apearance Make no mistake this is an older hotel and as such does have a few signs of wear and tear Some cracked veneer on the concrete by the pool chips in the concrete pillar in the swim up bar area some rust on the outside of the building etc. Is this wear and tear going to take away from your experience at the hotel. In my opinion not in the slightest. Most older hotels that are on the beach are going to show signs of their environment Salt water is not find to most surfaces. As far as the rooms go. I found them to be very nice shape and well furnished. I did have a burned out bulb in one of the rooms but hey those things happen and it was not a lamp we needed anyway. The bed we had was very nice and the linens soft and pure white. The water pressure left a lot to be desired but it was at least functional. We did not get an ocean front room but our room still had a great side view of the ocean. The balcony is really only good for the morning review of the weather as it is a triangle shape and does not have enough room to put a chair outside. Not a big deal because there are so many gorgeous places to sit out in the AM with your starbucks coffee and contemplate life. Lobby Common Area. The lobby was well finished and very inviting. You could tell the lobby was recently renovated and gave a very nice upscale feel to it. There was always plenty of comfortable leather and wicker seats available around the lobby common area. It was a good thing there were seats around the lobby because that s about the only place to really get a good wifi signal. Some other guests that were more centrally located stated they were able to get a wifi in their room. We were on the east wing and it did not get much of a signal. With that said unles your on a business trip I was sort of glad I did not get a signal on the beach or the room. It takes a day to get used to no signal but once you get over the lack of service it becomes very liberating. All Inclusive I would say this place is a junior all inclusive and I do not mean that in a bad way. Its not a sandals breezes type of all inclusive in the sense of your every whim is catered too. This place offers you a great value in terms of a clean room and food drink package. The drinks alone my wife and I had would have justified the all inclusive then you throw in the food and its a no brainer. Drinks all house beer wine and house liquor unles they run out and then they might give you the good stuff. If you are just drinking mixed drinks the alcohol is more than acceptable and the kalik beer is not to shabby. Fod Some of the food was pretty good and other things were hard to swallow no pun intended. Cilantro The Grouper Ceviche was damn tasty. Duck tacos also a good choice fyi they are really Taquito Flauta rolled up fried. The chocolate mouse with poblano peppers is very fun and delicious just a slight kick on the back end. The not so good was the grouper which my wife and I comically called grouper jerky as it was dry and tough. I have had well done steak that was more tender than that fish but oh well its all inclusive just order moreNikei This was very good overall. We really did not have anything bad here although we did stick with the raw fish and rolls. The rice was the right consistency fish tasted clean and fresh. The rolls were not terribly big but they had some good flavor and texture. Wife got the grouper roll and this time the fish was very tender and moist. FYI no sake on the menu which was sort of a bummer even though one of the drinks has sake as an ingredient was told the sake was premixed in the drink and thus was not available as a stand aloneCampus Gril The pool patio has two grills set up where you can order typical pool side fare. Hotdogs Hamburgers. Chicken sandwiches and various paninis. Hotdog pretty good and plumpHamburger. Cheseburger Decent size and look. but to our surprise lacked really any flavor. It was eh. Chicken Sandwich Good standby lettuce tomato mayo. Nothing to exciting but satisfying Chicken Panini Not bad either had tomato and avocado. Bufet The buffet was actually very good. I do nt normally gravitate towards buffets but this one was more than decent. This is the only place to get breakfast int he AM. They have all the breakfast favorites omelet station bacon scrambled eggs sausage oj muffins etc. There were even a few stations for the adventurous eaters out there. stewed pigs feet steamed conch sweet chili glazed mahi. The stewed Conch and pigs feed were actually very tasty. For the first fews days we did not know the buffet was open at lunch. When we discovered it was we were shocked to see what they had to offer. Crawfish stone crab claws mussels clams conch. They also had the regular stand by such as cold cuts various stews and soups etc. Service Well I am from NY so I am used to pretty expedited service. If you continue to expect the same level of service you will be disappointed. 1 You are on a tropical island where everything moves at a slower pace. No one is in a hurry but that is not necessarily a bad thing. 2 You are at an all inclusive ie no real incentive to rush to serve you as they are not really working on tips. With that said I was always brought up to tip when someone is doing a good job and this destination was no exception. I would throw a few dollars to the bartender or waitress every so often and would get prompt service. I found almost all the staff and servers very friendly and helpful. While I suppose you do not have to tip at all inclusive these people work hard and I think it goes a long way in getting you the service you want. Everyone was very appreciate of the money. Tips for your stay Worried about long times between drinks. just order two at once. Ask the front desk for change in the AM as the desk can get very busy in the afternoons. Get a starbucks coffee before going down to the buffet service at the buffet was very very sloweven with a tip and the coffee they service is terrible. Go across the street if you want a real daquiri there is a stand and you could get a smoothie in the AM chose up to 3 flavors all with real fresh ingredients strawberries bananas limes and the guy is cracking open coconuts in the back or have some fun an add booze. The guy has a heavy hand and its well worth the extra dollar 5 without booze 6 with. Fish Fry is a must its a row of shack restaurants just outside the downtown area We went to Oh Andros and it was extremely god lots of locals go there so you know its bahamian food. Grayclif Hotel is a must see such a cool hotel we went to their rodizio restaurant and it was by far the best meal of the trip. Round after round of freshly roasted meats that they cut at your table. BEWARE the scammers on the beach selling you vacations clubs. They will lie to get you to go to their office. They will originally hand you info for the atlantis and tell you that they will give you a day pass once you sit through there seminar. They originally stated 1 hour then when we got to the office not at the atlantis by the way it was 90 min. Then they wo nt let you leave and since they are the ones that took you there they will say they have to wait for the van to get back. We WASTED 4 HOURS and withstood high pressure sales pitches. Oh and the day Pass that they say allows you to go everywhere in Atlantis is only good for the aquarium and you still end up having to pay an additional 6 dollars and get your own ride back to your hotel. BEWARE of RUBIN He will lie through his teeth to get you to agree to this seminar. Tell him to F off if you want to enjoy your trip. They ask for 18k for their membership and a closing cost the closing cost is non refundable so basically once you realize they are scaming you you are out the closing cost.

So we stayed at the Melia for 9 nights as part of our honeymoon in April. Of all the hotel and location were great. The beach is to die for I have never seen water like it. The facilities on the beach were great too you could use the water sports such as the padleboards for free. The beach bar was nice too. There was plenty of sunbeds but not many umbrellas. The food was good with a nice variety of restaurants. The Mexican and the Asian fusion were our favourite. The buffet was also very good with plenty of choice and it was updated daily. The room was impressive very modern amazing views and a comfy bed. There was only one chair on the balcony but we fixed this by taking the other chair in the room onto the balcony. Would be nice to have two chairs. The downsides are the staff at the buffet breakfast in the morning were really miserable and quite rude like it was an inconvenience you being there. By this I mean the ladies who show you to your table the waiting on staff were lovely. The check in process was a bit of a pain as we booked through virgin and the Melia did not have our booking luckily they had space and they upgraded us to a nicer room because of the issue. My other massive problem was the fact they had a conference on in the hotel with over 400 people. The first week of our holiday was perfect you could relax on the beach and enjoy the paradise the last four days were ruined by a HUGE conference taking place. You could not get a sun lounger you could not get to the bar they were obviously very noisy when they were let out after their sessions it turned into a party hotel not ideal when you are on honeymoon. Because of this we actually left the hotel a couple of nights and went out for dinner. It completely ruined the experience. I know we are only a couple of people and the hotel would prefer to take on groups of 400 people but it really did put a dampner on the end of the holiday. I wish we would have been told about this before we had booked it would have made us reassess. My advise would be to check if they are holding anything like this at the time you are going.", "offset": [479, 556], "date": "2015-05-14", "cpt": "0", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 7, "uid": "ac051d9a-9210-44b1-a2bc-cdc81527dc81", "sentence": "This place is great.

My daughter and I recently spent 3 nights at the Melia Nassau Beach. They have a very nice location on Cable Beach and we spent most of our time in that beautiful sea. Our room which was one of their special level rooms was clean modern and had a great beach and resort view with an ok balcony. You had to stand to see the view and could see the other guests on their balconies but that was fine. For an added cost we booked one of their level rooms which guaranteed you a full ocean view room a special area for check in on the 4th floor which had snacks and drinks. You also had a special area on the beach which was supposed to have beach service. The problem with the Melia is the service which should be addressed by management. The first problem is the check in. Even with the special level checkin guests are kept waiting over an hour to check into rooms while 2 employees are trying to handle the load. The problem there was that not only are you being checked into your room you are then having reservations being made for specialty restaurants for your stay. Each restaurant is being called to check for availability while everyone else is just waiting to get into their rooms after a long flight. Terrible practice. The people at the desks were very nice they should just be handling check ins not restaurant reservations. The worst service was at the main buffet restaurant. Service was basically nonexistent. You were kept waiting on line while someone found a table for you. Once seated no one came over to offer a drink. You served yourself at the buffet which had good enough selections but no coffee or tea area. Back at the table we asked 2 people for a cup of tea both said yes and never returned. When we asked one of them what happened to the tea she said we were not in her section. If it is too much trouble to bring tea or coffee have it available in the buffet area so guests can serve themselves. Another day there was a long line waiting to be seated for lunch and someone announces that there is going to be a long wait inside and outside. Meanwhile there were plenty of empty tables. I asked where else we could have lunch and the woman turned her head and would not answer. Guests should be allowed to seat themselves since there is no table service anyway. Employees should just focus on clearing and cleaning off the tables. Lastly the supposed beach service at the Level beach area. First day I said hello to the server he looked at me said hello and kept going. We finally got him to bring us drinks. We were never offered another. Next day we were offered 2 bottles of water. Never offered anything else. We just ended up getting drinks from the nice guys at the beach bar. No problem but do not charge extra for non existent service. As for the food my daughter got sick after eating at the Japanese restaurant. Spent day 2 running back and forth to the bathroom. The Italian restaurant was the best that we tried. The Mexican was mediocre and again terrible service. We sat at the Tapas restaurant to listen to music and was never offered so much as a drink never mind tapas. The interior of the hotel has been renovated and is lovely. The beach was great our room was nice but the service was terrible and for that reason I would never recommend this hotel.", "offset": [3137, 3196], "date": "2015-07-17", "cpt": "0", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 10, "uid": "24011681-3dc8-419d-8f02-ccc248556b83", "sentence": "Good choice for all inclusive.

The balcony needs some appropriate patio furniture and not two kitchen type chairs and a small wicker table. Restaurants were mostly good. The buffet Market Place was excellent for breakfast and lunch and service was great here so not sure what other people are talking about. Actually we found the service to be good most places. We ate at the steak house and it was pretty good and as we were all inclusive you do get 20 off. Also if you just order the house wine beer there is no charge. The polside buffet is just ok and I would go inside unles you really want to stay outdoors. The Asian restaurant was very good as well. We went out down the road for Italian and it was ok nothing great but enjoyable Capriccio was the name I believe. Beach and pool area are indeed beautiful but it is busy.

Additionally he was there when we checked in and gave us a tour of the property and showed us to our rooms. He also checked in with us throughout our stay. he definitely went above and beyond. We were a little hesitant in booking this resort and reading the mixed reviews but we have been to a number of all inclusive resorts and this one met all of our expectations. The kids that traveled with us ranged in age from 8 15 and none of them were bored. The only complaints that we had during our stay would be the rooms do need to be updated but we were not hardly in our rooms so it did not bother us too much and the bartenders down at the beach did not like to serve our children. I think they tended to forget they are paying guests also and some would be rude to our children. The wifi service was awesome we even got service on the beach. There were plenty of huts or umbrellas for us to use on the beach. We used most of the non motorized equipment down at the beach and they were all great. The vendors on the beach are a bit of a nuisance. however if you want hair braids or souvenirs there is a shopping area across the street from the resort where you can find MUCH better prices and items to buy. Dinner each night was great we did not eat at the buffet any of the evenings but did for breakfast and lunch. They had the typical items you find at an all inclusive. however breakfast did offer a smoothie bar which was fantastic.

My husband and I travelled to the Melia Nassau Beach in April for a 4 night getaway and were pleasantly surprised at the resort. Since we usually vacation at larger resorts with our kids Iberostar Beaches Bahia. we felt this resort was much smaller but nice. It did not take us long to learn our way around. The staff was very friendly and the atmosphere was good. The food was better than we expected in the restaurants. The Tapas bar was our favorite with really good aps and drinks. The rooms were average and could use a facelift but I have been in worse rooms in Beaches Resorts for alot more money. The nightlife for younger people is lacking but most of the younger twenties people seemed to be taking taxis to the local clubs. The staff and local folks were friendly and helpful. The beach was beautiful as always. It was a last minute trip and we got a good deal. Would definitely try another resort by this chain in the future.", "offset": [504, 622], "date": "2017-08-03", "cpt": "1", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 17, "uid": "bd568cb8-7c12-4a6b-932d-9f0c6ab9c4bc", "sentence": "Fantastic Beach Wonderful Views Great Service. Just came home from our honeymoon at Melia in Nassau. It was a fantastic week and we have already discussed coming back as soon as we can make it. After checking out the grounds the first day at the resort we decided to upgrade to the level. While I think we still would have enjoyed the resort I can tell you that being on the Level is a MUST. The upgraded breakfast and lunch was fantastic. The concierges who take care of you on the level beach seem to love their work and it shows. They remembered us throughout the week and struck up conversations that showed they cared and were really enjoying making everyones stay as fun as possible. Also the level beach includes better chairs more palapas and these king sized bed things that are just magnificent. They was never a shortage of chairs on the level beach either with made things easy. You also get the top shelf liquor in the level which makes a huge difference when you wake up the next morning. On to the food. The first night pool buffet was not very impressive which had us worried. It was pretty basic and bland. However we very much enjoyed everything else we ate throughout the week. The Asian restaurant had really delicious sushi and the curry mahi mahi was awesome. Esta Vida which is the tapas place in the lobby may have been our favorite. It is open very late and has a great variety of food. The conch fritters were awesome. We did not plan our meals right but other couples we met down there told us the hibachi was fantastic so we are excited to try that next time. That brings up another cool detail about this resort. Everyone was friendly and we ended up hanging out with a group of three other couples from all around the world. It made for a really fun time during meals pool time and especially at night during the dj sets. Finally the room was fine. The bed was very comfortable the view from the spacious balcony was gorgeous and the bathroom was nice. However it took two days to get our mini fridge filled and there was a spot in the carpet with an exposed nail. There were also some spots of the hotel that need to be repainted or patched up. Really with just a little work done to the rooms like fixing that carpet issue a bit of painting or patching this could quickly become a five star trip. Also to be fair they had people painting and patching all week. I think the people running Melia know of these issues and are making the right steps to fix them. So overall I would highly recommend this resort. Just make sure to upgrade to the level for the best experience.", "offset": [2095, 2175], "date": "2017-10-01", "cpt": "1", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 18, "uid": "852b1652-732f-4008-845b-62976c96fba4", "sentence": "Amazing stay will come again. My fiance and I were at the Melia for a week and our experience was great. First we did not pay for the Level Experience. We had a great room with a nice view of the ocean. If you can please ask to be place in the West Wing as there is renovation going in the East Wing. Secondly do not believe the people that are saying the servers and the staff is rude. Everybody greeted us with a smile no exception here. When you smile people smile back at you hi hiThirds the restaurant are pretty good. The buffet is a buffet meaning there is stuff for everyone and you can always find something you like. If the buffet does not satisfy for you breakfast I have no idea what you eat at home. there is an omelet bar smoothie bar fresh fruits cheeses breads muffins veggies cold cuts oats cereals. I am amazed how people complained on Tripadvisor the buffet is fine guys lol For the a la carte restaurant I would suggest to book the Japanese hibachi or regular menu. It was really good. The mexicain is Italian are good. The real surprise for us was the EstaVida tapas bar no reservation needed and the food was perfect for happy hourFour well the beach is amazing. Again we did not book the Level experience and we always had chairs on the beach or by the pool. The grounds are well keep and the tools are nice. I would recommended any of my friends or my family to go there. Thanks again Melia. We will be back.", "offset": [203, 300], "date": "2019-12-15", "cpt": "1", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 19, "uid": "50f9aff9-eebe-4fbe-9a56-9bb4ffd8d82e", "sentence": "Really a great place. We stayed 6 nights in a LEVEL ocean view room on the 8th floor west wing January 23 29 2020. Overall the property is well laid out well run and well kept for being nearly 40 years old. The property is a mid price range 35star resort that welcomes families of all kinds. This is not like the Vegas style complex of Atlantis and Baha Mar and the price is much much friendlier. All employees are very kind and love to talk about their families and are interested in getting to know you as well. Please be kind to these very hard working people and you will receive kindness and a smile right back. The service is wonderful we never had to wait for service at any restaurant or lounge. I wish I could remember all of the names of the employees so I could commend them properly here ALL of them are superb. I have read many reviews here where people complain about slow service I just do n\u2019t understand those comments. Please take a deep breath relax and enjoy your vacation. Remember there are several hundred guests at the resort at any given time you are not the only person there be patient nice and courteous of others and you will love this place and want to return many times as we do. Pro tip bring lots of 1 and 5 bills for tips for bartenders servers and room attendants. Check in. Arrived at the resort at 245pm. We proceeded to the LEVEL lounge for check in where we were greeted by Owen who checked us in and provided all of the resort information the room was not ready yet so we had a beer at the pool and got the room key about 40 minutes later very easyLEVEL lounge. There is a coffee machine that will make regular coffee espresso hot water for tea etc. There is a bar cart with spirits sodas and water juice and small snacks. There are sofas and chairs to relax on but never saw anyone in there. I got my coffee out of the machine each day. Note. there is a Keurig coffee maker in the room. The room Very clean well kept beds were comfortable sheets clean shower water very hot. They will only make up your room if you ask them to they are on a \u201c green \u201d schedule. so you hang your \u201c make up the room \u201d card on the door handle we had the room cleaned every other day re used our towels once. Wash cloths seem to be in demand as we only saw two of them in 6 days so if you use a wash cloth all the time you can go to the beautiful newly remodeled gym they have them there that you can take to your room. There is a safe that I used for my laptop phone passports etc. There is a mini fridge that has 2 bags of small chips 2 granola bars 4 soft drinks and 2 waters they will replenish with the same each time they clean the room. Pro tip call room service to request more bottled water it is not provided anywhere on the property all water is poured from their filtered water system it taste just fine. You can also buy bottled water in the gift shop. Pro tip bring your Yeti tumbler you can refill with water or club soda at the fountains at the lobby bar and the adult pool bar. Bartenders will also fill the tumbler up with your favorite beverage. Food. Overall the food is just ok. If you are a \u201c foodie \u201d this is not your resort. My favorite was the Black Angus not included the steak was perfectly cooked veggies were freshly grilled and the shrimp cocktail is huge and delicious and the service is top notch. Nikei Tepanyaki table is delicious and was a lot of fun with the group that sat with us there are 12 seats food was really good. Market Place buffet we only had breakfast there every day. the fruit and made to order omelets were great the rest of it was pretty basic. Cilantro was good but food was not piping hot. Esta Vida was not good hot food was cold not much of a selection all flavorless and really could n\u2019t make a meal out of it. O\u2019grile is the outdoor grill. If you are a LEVEL guest they serve breakfast starting at 730am and is next to the adult pool very convenient for lunch every day my favorite was the chicken Caesar wrap the burger was ok French fries were always cold. The restaurants close on a rotating basis be sure to ask what days each restaurant will be open then set up your reservations early. I was told the reason for the rotating closings is that they are retrofitting and upgrading the kitchens and that can only be done when the restaurants are closed. You can email the resort ahead of time they will try to accommodate you one week before you arrive with 1 or 2 reservations if you are not LEVEL if you are LEVEL they will try to accommodate you as much as possible since you have priority. Thursday thru Sunday are the busiest days at the resort so plan ahead. Room service is included with no charge delivery fee for LEVEL guests it is 10 delivery charge for non LEVEL guests. Pools. There are 3 pools the adult pool is in the center of the property that has the swim up bar NO kids here. They had 2 foam parties at the adult pool one on Monday one on Tuesday it was VERY loud and most of the folks in the pool were drunk acting like fools luckily it ends by 530pm. We all like to party but show some respect. I am told that the foam party will not last much longer because of problems caused by drunken guests. The east end pool is for families of all ages the west end pool is for families of all ages but I only saw small kids there I nicknamed it the \u201c diaper \u201d pool for many reasons as you can imagine. No smoking at the pools but you can smoke on the beach. Beach the LEVEL section has many palapas beds and chairs all have a nice pad on them. There is a separate towel hut for LEVEL guests LEVEL towels are green and made of a heavy fabric a higher quality than the non LEVEL blue and white towels. There is drink and food service directly to your seat on the LEVEL beach. The non LEVEL beach there is a server but it takes a long time to get a drink it \u2019s easier faster for you to walk to the pool bar for your beverage. Pro tip bring towel clips to hold your towel in place. You can bring your LEVEL green towel to the pools toYou can walk a short distance to the Baha Mar pier where you can take the free water taxi ride over to Balmoral Island they have a dolphin experience a few sting rays beach gift shop and a bar. Bring lots of money as everything is very expensive. We stayed one hour and left really nothing for us there. There is a new walkway to the Baha Mar complex that was just completed it \u2019s great for morning exercise walks and access to the complex. Pro tip There is construction on the east side of the resort at the Baha Mar complex where they are building a massive water park it is supposed to be completed late 2023 early 2024. So if you book the lowest room categories and are given a room on the east exterior your room may face the construction however only floors 1 3 have no view the upper floors you can still see the water as the balcony is set on an angle. Be sure to ask the location of your room when you check in. If you have any questions send a message.", "offset": [2228, 2438], "date": "2020-01-29", "cpt": "1", "category": "renovation"}]}
