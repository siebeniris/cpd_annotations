Pros there was a fridge and microwave the beds were comfortable the breakfast buffet was not bad lots of food and it was warm however it was the same menu all three mornings we were there while they did forget the towels they did bring them up rather quickly the front desk was helpful with calling a cab and the hotel provided a shuttle for us to eat at a restaurant. The food at the restaurant at the hotel was not bad we could not walk anywhere and did not have a car so ate supper their twice. We did not use the pool so I can not comment on the other amenities offered.

I booked two rooms at the hotel. One for my 10 year old daughter and some friends for her birthday and one for me so they could have their own space. I booked it because I had to be in that area since one of her friends lives in Dallas and it is marketed as a 4 Star hotel. The hotel was very outdated and stale smelling. The rooms were very cramped with the beds literally butting up to the window. Wallpaper was peeling everywhere and stains on the walls. Bathrooms were terribly in need of some attention with peeling wallpaper gross tubs showers and crusty water damage on the bottom of the bathroom door. Here \u2019s the kicker though. The most important part of why I booked there was the fact that they have an indoor pool. First of all the picture of the pool online looks great but that \u2019s not what you get. The girls were so upset and grossed out because the bottom of the pool felt slimy the water was so foggy that they could n\u2019t even see while wearing goggles and they saw several disgusting objects including a bandaid and big clumps of hair everywhere. Oh yeah and if you needed towels you had to go to the front desk and ask for some. That \u2019s what everyone at the pool was doing. Lastly later in the evening not in front of the girls I mentioned it to the front desk and instead of an apology they said thanks for letting us know and offered an explanation in the form of blaming it on the hotel owners due to the fact that they keep the pool running 24 hours a day and it \u2019s impossible for maintenance to keep it clean and let the water filter cycle completely. I\u2019m only allowed to post one picture for each category.

Do not be deceived by the nice pictures especially of the pool. The pictures were one of the main reasons for choosing this hotel near the airport but I would not step foot in the pool after seeing its obviously unmaintained condition. This hotel may be in the beginning stages of a remodel but that is not an excuse for ignoring the upkeep of the interior exterior of the property. The outdoor patio area by the pool was littered with used towels broken chairs and cigarette butts. The doors for entering the pool area were not secure and damaged. The use of card key entry was not active on any of the doors entering the area. There were people in the pool who looked like they came in off the street from the surrounding neighborhood. At check in I was asked if I would like a room with one or two beds. I said it really did not matter but I assumed the two bed option would be a couple of queen beds. What we ended up with was a tight room with two full size beds. Although not ideal we were willing to deal with it until we found out that the toilet would not flush properly and the tub would not drain. The following morning I requested a room change to a king room. The staff was very accommodating and the king room turned out to be quite nice. A few positive notes the bar and bartender were nice with a good local beer selection and pub food. In addition the hotel has two shuttle vans that will take you to local restaurants and shopping areas at no charge. Kudos to the hotel for that.

Crown Plaza Hotel is a great place to stay. You just have to see for yourself and ca n\u2019t always believe these silly reviews that purposely report any and every little thing. This hotel offers a lot of amenities for the price and is very close to the main highways. The hotel is newly renovated and exceptionally clean. I really enjoyed the indoor pool area that is air conditioned so you do n\u2019t feel like you \u2019re going to suffocate although they no longer have the hot tub. As far as the room we were put in a corner room which has plenty of space and extremely cozy and comfortable. I give this place a 10 all the way around because I was highly impressed especially after reading some of the reviews that say to be careful at night which is a totally racist statement. Yes there are black people all through the Hotel and you would be really shocked to see so many from such an upscale hotel but they are totally harmless and very friendly and peaceful. Special thanks go out to the Front Desk Clerk named Tyesha Brown for taking care of me. She was very respectful over the phone and assigned my room before I arrived. I asked for a lot and she happily accommodated me. I am casino spoiled as far as being catered to and Tyesha made me feel as if I was at the Venetian or Belagio in Las Vegas.
