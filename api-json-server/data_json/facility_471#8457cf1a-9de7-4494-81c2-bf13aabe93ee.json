We are a family of three from Bombay my parents and me and we stayed in a deluxe garden view room in the Garden Wing for seven nights. I will start with the negatives and get them out of the way the service we have received has been extremely inconsistent right from the housekeeping staff to the staff in the eating establishments. The turndown service which traditionally entails preparing the room for the night drawing the curtains closed turning on the lights etc was deficient all they did was literally turn down the bed covers and they forgot to do even that on our second night. At the end of our second day a small letter from the manager informing us of the long stay plan along with a form about personalising our room was left on our bed I promptly filled it out and went down to deliver it right away since the Garden Wing reception was closed for the night it was 115PM I gave it to the woman at the Tower Wing reception but she obviously had no idea what it was and I suspect she just threw it away because none of our requests were ever honoured night service during a particular time period an emptied minibar so that we could keep our own drinks and desserts in the fridge and other little things that could have made our stay a little more comfortable but would have cost the hotel little time and effort to arrange. We often encountered sour faced impatience bordering on rudeness from the staff at The Line their all day dining restaurant where the breakfast buffet is served and at the lobby where the complimentary evening hors doeuvres are served. In the lobby we were told on two different days that certain choice tables with the best seats were occupied even when they obviously were not and one particular stewardess would give us annoyed looks if we had ask her to replenish the ice bucket or open a new bottle of wine also on one day when we asked for peanuts with the complimentary beer we were told there were no peanuts which is obviously absolutely fine and were instead furnished with a bowl of fried root vegetable chips but the next day when we requested the same we were huffily told that the crisps are available only for people who pay for their alcohol which is also fine but there is a way of conveying this to the guest without being rude that you expect from a five star hotel. On the other hand we noticed that people who were rude and demanding got excellent service on three evenings we noticed people who loudly threw their weight around and demanded to see the chef because the choices in the complimentary food was not to their satisfaction and got huge personalised platters of sandwiches at no extra cost. We were excessively polite and respectful at all times and kept our tone request like but we find ourselves wondering if it might be necessary to act indignant and odious in order to receive respect from people in the Singaporean hospitality industry. However Sharon in the lobby was wonderful always polite patient and smiling. In addition the food at the breakfast buffet was very mediocre except for the egg station the Indian section was like a small assortment of random food that was just thrown together and the dim sum and porridge were terrible which was weird because the complimentary hors doeuvres were really delicious. These criticisms might sound nitpicky but ultimately when you pay 730 a night to stay in a place you expect service that matches standards that this premium price promises. Now on to the positives this is a BEAUTIFUL hotel. The location off Orchard Road is perfect it is just a seven minute leisurely stroll away from it and yet tucked safely out of reach of its hustle and bustle in a beautiful tree lined largely residential area. The pool is enormous and lovely as are the luxuriously decorated and plushly furnished lobby and the landscaped garden. Our room had a lovely spacious balcony with a very nice view by Singaporean standards and a great bathroom the room itself could have been a little larger but it is not a big deal. The WiFi is blazing fast and really quite excellent and the unlimited complimentary water coffee tea in the rooms and snacks and alcohol in the evenings made it what we Indians call a total paisa vasol experience. Overall although the service was spotty we will probably return to this hotel the next time we stay in Singapore but there will be others in the future who might take their business to a five star with better service.", "offset": [2960, 3036], "date": "2015-01-04", "cpt": "0", "category": "facility"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "73a57f6e-d836-4f2a-b049-f9206963a86d", "sentence": "Garden Wing. The hotel lobby is very impressive and the service was impeccable. We stayed one night at Deluxe Pool View room in Garden Wing which would have been nice enough for two but we upgraded to a One Bedroom Suite because we wanted more room for three. The suite was exquisite. The architecture of Garden Wing may look outdated but do not worry the rooms are five star. As a Garden Wing guest we were allowed to choose from two breakfast restaurants The Line and The Waterfall. The selection of food in buffet at The Line is definitely five stars and beyond however atmosphere there is busy and restless and the interior decoration is not quite what you expect from a five star hotel. On the other hand The Waterfall is more tranquil but there you must order you coffee and eggs and wait for them. They also served coplimentary afternoon drinks and canap\u00e9s for Garden Wing guests at the lobby lounge which was delightful. Check also the BLU bar for a great evening city view.

My husband and I spent 4 nights in the Garden Wing for his special birthday. The entrance and welcome were spectacular. Check in was swift and friendly and we were delighted to be upgraded to a pool view room from our original city view booking as a birthday gift. We were happy with our original booking plans but the views over the pool and gardens were just wonderful and very peaceful. The Garden Wing is lovely. We miss it. A lot of effort has gone into creating a serene environment and it is easy to forget that you are in the middle of the city. Our room was perfect. We enjoyed breakfast sat outside each morning. The choice was plentiful tasty and the staff were all friendly efficient and very professional. A very relaxing way to start the day. We also enjoyed having a drink in the evening in the lobby. Again lovely staff who were attentive whilst also allowing you to relax in peace to enjoy the music and evening atmosphere. We took part in high tea where again the food and choice was fantastic. The staff were excellent especially taking into account how busy they were at times. I particularly enjoyed the creme br\u00fbl\u00e9es and warm fresh little scones with fresh cream and jamWe enjoyed a couple of afternoons lounging around the polside and cooling in the pool. Yet again attentive and professional staff prepared loungers with fluffy towels whilst topping up cold drinks and remaining at a discreet distance to enable ultimate relaxation. The location of the hotel is great for Orchard Rd and shops. We walked to the shops and Botanic Gardens with ease. We chose a taxi for further flung places which were extremely good value compared to some UK taxi fares. Overall we loved our stay. It was a treat and we made the most of our time there. As you can probably tell from this review the staff really do make this place. We try not to visit the same places more than once as there are so many amazing places around the world to discover.

The valley wing is an oasis of calm and sophistication. A range of inclusive extras made the stay special. These included free drinks all day with Perier jouet champagne and a selection of decent wines plus cocktails and soft drinks free soft drinks from the mini bar and afternoon tea. We found the service in the lobby bar very good particular mention to Raj and Edward. There was usually a harpist playing which added to the atmosphere and we enjoyed the selection of canap\u00e9s in the evening. The room was large comfortable and well equipped but very old fashioned in terms of decor like the rest of the valley wingWe tried breakfast in the valley wing and at the Line. The Line had a large selection to chose from but was fairly busy. The valley wing had a much more chilled feel but the service was terrible. All 3 mornings we waited a long time simply to order and get tea and coffee which is not acceptable in this type of 5 hotel. One of the staff seemed new and did not really seem to know what he was doing. It was a shame as all the food was excellent with a large selection of a la carte choices. it is not on the menu but I recommend ordering some cut mango which was delicious. The main issue we had with the hotel was the pool. After the Bangkok Shangri la this was a big disappointment. There was virtually no pool service no water bought to you and very difficult to get anyones attention to get a menu or order a drink. The pool was full of children at the weekends many of which appeared unsupervised and made it a chaotic atmosphere. The lifeguard completely ignored any bad behaviour including at one point 8 children including a toddler in the jacuzi on their own plus 2 inflatables which the children kept bumping into the poor adults using the jacuzi. I have never been to a hotel that did not have any safety warnings on a jacuzi and would let children use it let along unsupervised. This was not a cool jacuzi but one at around 38 40c and I think the hotel should take childrens safety more seriously as well as ensuring that all guests are able to enjoy the facilities. It looked like the children that were not behaving belonged to people that may have been local judging by the fact they were also riding scooters round the pool. Also not very safe.", "offset": [349, 434], "date": "2015-09-20", "cpt": "0", "category": "facility"}, {"id": 4, "uid": "c0403731-4bb6-46c3-b934-58548d42f0c3", "sentence": "Still mesmerizing. I recently spent eight nights in the shangri la valley wing. In the late 90s my husband and i spent a lot of time at this hotel as he had business in singapore and we would stay for several weeks at a time. Having the opportunity to travel back recently I was not sure if it would live up to my memories. Well it most certainly did and exceeded them. I have to first explain that the valley wing is like a small hotel within the hotel. I have travelled all over the world and stayed at some of the nicest resorts Singita in Africa four seasons tented camps Thailand etc and I have to say the service in the valley wing was exceptional. Every morning we had breakfast in the exclusive valley wing area and it was lovely. Our waiter Hari was exceptionally gracious and professional. Offering us special items not even on the menu. Two of the concierges reception ladies were also always a pleasure I believe one was named Nora and the other Alex. Both very helpful knowledgable and again so very gracious. Even the door men would delightfully greet us every morning. The afternoon tea was a very nice option each afternoon. The evening cocktails and canap\u00e9s were divine lovely champagne being poured freely all inclusive. The room itself was lovely and comfortable quite large with a beautiful bathroom with large marble tub and separate shower. The bed was extremely comfortable. I would say the rooms are slightly dated but still very elegant. The grounds of this property are still superb very tropical you really do not feel as though you are in the middle of a city. The walk to orchard road and botanical gardens was easily reached with 10 15 minutes or so. Pool is lovely and big went to the hair salon quite a few times and had very nice blow outs. Only ate dinner at the Shang palace and it was not quite what I remembered it has been modernized but still very good. Would give it 4 out of 5 stars. Satays by the pool were an excellent chose. If I could give the Valley wing more than five stars I would. I do not believe the tower wing is quite up to the standard of the valley wing my mum was originally booked in the tower wing and switched immediately.

Gosh. Where do I start. My mrs and I had a wonderful weekend staycation at the Valley Wing Shangri La Hotel. From the moment we arrived at the Reception we were warmly welcomed. Check in procedure was over expeditiously and we were whisked to our Deluxe Room on the 11th floor. Oh what a wonderful delightful room 57 sqm of luxury space. Goodness the bathroom itself is bigger than my study room. You can even watch TV while you soak in the large bathtub. Pamper yourself with the premium toiletries. Yes I took the toiletries home. Everything about the room speaks impeccable luxurious taste. A welcome fruit basket and fully stocked mini bar. All drinks complimentary except for the alcoholic beverages. The bed was so comfortable especially the Lavender scented pillows we slept soundly. there is even a menu for the pillow. Can you believe it. The Valley Wing comes with many perks. Complimentary hi tea paired with delicious snacks was served from 2 5 pm. Followed by complimentary champagne wine juices and canapes in the Champagne Bar from 5 7 pm. I had the excellent Sauvignon Blanc Te Kairanga New Zealand. Unlike Oliver Twist you can ask for seconds. I dare say even third helpingsNedles to say. my mrs and I had such a wonderful delicious time we hardly had much room left for dinner later at the Shang Palace. Oh breakfast. Glorious breakfast was in the private Summit Room only for guests staying at the Valley Wing. Besides the buffet spread of fruits bread and more we also ordered from the Continental menu designed by chef Christophe Moret. there is also choices for Japanese or local cuisinesyou have got to try the omelette in banana with caviar and the toasted French roll.

The bed was comfortable and staff at the reception was generally friendly. Room service was prompt and good as well. Free parking is a definite plus. I booked a room for two beds but was first told that I was assigned to a room with one bed which was slightly annoying but not terrible. However upon check in we were told that the room was located on a smoking floor which is completely unacceptable as we had requested for a non smoking room and my companion has asthma which obviously does not allow us to stay in a smoking room or floor for that matter. I was told that they then managed to find us a room on a non smoking floor. Upon occupying the room we realize that it was a room with disabled access which is fine with us. However later in the evening after a shower in the bathroom I was horrified to find out that the entire bathroom was flooded after just a ten minute shower. There was at least an inch thick of water which took at least 20 minutes to drain out. I promptly called guest services to inform them of the situation and they did clean the bathroom before I returned later that evening. As we were staying for just one night I did not bother requesting for a change of room. The flooding occurred again the next morning and I almost slipped while walking through the puddle. I should also mention that access from the rooms to the pool and gym level was blocked during that weekend due to renovations this was also not brought to my attention when checking in or even prior to that. What that meant was that I had to waddle through the crowded lobby of the hotel in my robes to get to the only escalator which could access the pool then back to the room after which is clearly inconvenient. While I applaud Shanghai La for taking care to have rooms with disable access the fact that the bathroom floods in at least an inch thick of water every time someone takes a shower is clearly unacceptable and dangerous especially for the disabled.

It was totally ruined my excitement and feeling of relaxing and good day at Spa. I really did not understand why no one at Chi Spa knew about the maintenance work at the gym. I asked Spa manager for some explanations. She kindly offered the alternative to use the Swimming pool and outside jacuzi but I felt so disappointed so I declined the offer and ask to have spa treatment as soon as possible. I was offered a complementary collagen mask during the deep tissue body massage. The massage was excellent. The masseuse Stephanie was excellent. She taught me how to massage my body to release the tensions. I learned many things about my body from her. She was very caring and has profound knowledge on what she is doing.
