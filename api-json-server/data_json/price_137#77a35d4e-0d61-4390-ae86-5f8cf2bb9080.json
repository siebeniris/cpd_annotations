It costed 22 dollars and had a good amount of fodcome Time for dessert I bit into a cholocate dessert but notice a fuzz after I ate it. I showed it to one of the cooks and he informed me that mold can not grow on chocolate. I told him look I am not trying to start a scene or make accusations but do not want anyone else eating this cause I worked in the food business before and old enough to know when something has mold. He then looks at what is on the line ignores me and then tells the other cook to put more out there. Not even a thank you. The other cook then thanks me and got the manager to come talk to me to comp my meal. He comes over and asks how the situation can be resolved. I then said well what do you have in mind. He then replied well that is up to you sir. I said I just wanted to make sure that no one was going to eat this food. He quickly said ok and offered me to try a stupid smoothie. I just had moldy chocolate now I going to have a fresh fruit smoothie. No thanks I paid the full 22 plus a 5 dollar tip and threw out my card to the place. It ruined my night and I was going to gamble too but could not see giving them another dollar my money. I have never been treated this way or eating mold anywhere I have eaten I was disgusted by management and food quality.

Two nights ago I lost 3875 dollars on a 10 machine. Rene told me discretely that every single progressive machine is thoroughly fixed and that it is almost impossible to win anything major. Yesterday I took out an additional 40 and lost it all as well. I want to thank these ladies because I was walking back into the Hard Rock with an additional 250 today. The slot tech who works for the casino saw me in the garage apparently she was leaving and said and I quote since the Seminole Tribe has to pay a huge new tax to the state of Florida they have tightened the machines to new levels of impossibilities. She went on to say Ray you seem like a nice older guy. save your money do not even bother coming in with your 250. It speaks volumes when two full time employed slot attendants are genuine enough to warn me after seeing me lose almost 80 in two days that this casino in Tampa is absolutely one of the most corrupt tightest casinos ever known to exist. Legally I could never prove this in court however I looked into the eyes of Rene she was so real about how crooked this casino truly is. They have a nice diverse staff from slot techs to waitresses to dealers. However the casino is virtually impossible to win in. It truly is a money pit. Friends who are reading this. If you do not believe me seek out Rene she is a tall red haired slot tech about 45 years old and Josephine is a rather large Latin lady. You could not miss her if you tried. They were so genuine when they came and walked by me for hours on end seeing me consistently losing. They genuinely felt bad. Be careful. Do not get caught in this trap.

I just want to give people a heads up so they do not go through what I experienced. Well I have been a customer of the seminole hardrock casino since 209. Both my parents are Xcard members. We used to enjoy going there together to play the slots and eat at their restaurants. Unfortunately I will not be going there anymore and would not advice my family and friends to do so either. On 12122016 I had a friend that was flying in from New York. Since my mom gambles a lot at their casino they usually comp her with rooms. I requested my mom if she could get a room for me and my friend she agreed. I went to the casino with my mom around 4 pm so she could have me registered to the room with my drivers licence identification. everything went smoothly and my mom left. My friends flight was scheduled to land at 11 pm on 12122016. Since I was already at the casino I decided to play some poker. I did not do well and lost my and ended up at the bar to pass my time. I met a lady at the bar and we chatted while we sipped on our cocktails. We got hungry and ended up at the hardrock cafe where we had a few more cocktails shots and food. Finally my friend had arrived and I split up with my lady friend. I escorted my friend to the room and came back downstairs. By this time the alcohol hit me hard. Next thing I know I am between an argument with the security. It had something to do with my name not being in their system at the hotel. The argument escalated and the seminole police were called. No physical violence whatsoever. I kinda remember things in phases and whatever my friend told me. The seminole police charged me with trespassing and disorderly conduct and took me to orient road jail. So I have a Trespassing charge on my record now. Proper training of their security and police would have avoided this situation.

The buffet struggled to achieve subpar quality despite calling for a higher price than I have paid for greatly superior buffets in Las Vegas. I was forced to come here alone because the friends I have in the area refuse to return to this casino after it arrogantly began charging 10 for parking. The casinos greed is unreal. The nerve to charge for parking when this single casino brings in hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue every year is astonishing. It was not even just two or three bucks parking went from free straight to ten dollars. Unbelievable. This is not Vegas so cool it with trying to nickel and dime patrons to death. Even if you pay to park in Vegas the drinks are at least free. I am glad to see the 10 parking greed quelled and finally put to an end.

Great water slide which had a lifeguard at the top and bottom. They closed the pool any and every time they thought there might be thunder.
