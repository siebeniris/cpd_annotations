Michael was proactive in spotting our favourite sun beds and offering to reserve them and put towels out each morning which he did. it is easy to completely relax here in the humidity it was hard to do much at all. However do go swimming with turtles as that is stunning they have several and one is huge and you can touch them and swim with them completely brilliant. Ryan on water sports is fabulous and if you go swimming with turtles with him it is even more extraordinary as he feeds them and plays with them and helps people get good photos etc. Ryan also taught us to paddle board which was fun. Restaurant Cafe Taboras had great breakfast buffet with fresh cooked eggs any way you wanted smoked salmon huge range of options get this included in the room rate for best value. Afternoon tea a nice touch too. Ate there for dinner and one lunch and food consistently very good. My daughter is still craving their Caesar salad with king prawns which is the best she is ever had.

This hotel is virtually unique on the island for having all 72 rooms situated right on the beach and facing the sea 24 of them junior suites on the ground floor benefitting from the addition of a small lounge area and spacious private patio with top sun loungers and large umbrellas plus a dining table. It was the later category that I. we have had this and last December. By the very nature that this is not a huge hotel there is plenty of space calm and a higher degree of privacy that many other hotels in Barbados. The immaculate rooms are kept spotless by friendly staff and the guests and the 24 junior suites enjoy shared butler service including delivered canap\u00e9s between 6 and 7 pm. These are introduced. Breakfast is very good and there is plenty of choice. We had decided to eat out most nights but attended the General Managers cocktail party on the Tuesday and the sumptuous gala style buffet that followed at around 150 bajan each it was great value and it is a shame the hotel do not have more success promoting this on the west coast as greater attendance would both boast the atmosphere and ensure that the vast display of food is consumed on the night. I have no doubt that staff feeding on Tuesday night and Wednesdays is world class hereThe hotel has a couple of hundred metres or spectacular beach and Ju Jus authentic bar at one end and just beyond one of the islands top restaurants Lone Star.

If your idea of paradise is relaxing on a beautiful beach looking at the turquoise sea and listening to the waves lapping feet from your lounger where the team strive to anticipate your every need then the Royal Pavilion is just the place for you. We have visited this Bajan gem on many occasions and have always come back home totally relaxed and planning our next return trip. We were not people who made return visits to a hotel as we always thought there must be somewhere better out there. After having the Pavilion recommended to us we thought we would give it a try and have been totally smitten ever since. On arrival at the hotel you will receive a genuine warm welcome and will be checked in offered a drink and shown to your room by one of the front office staff and quickly realise that yes you have made the best hotel choice on the island. The view of the beach and sea from the 72 beachfront rooms is breathtaking and given the west facing location the sunsets are fabulous. Spoil yourself and enjoy a cocktail either on your balcony or with fellow guests on the beautiful terrace bar area. The General Manager Tim and his well trained and happy team will look after and pamper you with true Bagan warmth from the minute you arrive until you leave. If there is something you would like to have just ask. If it is possible they will make it happen. I have decided not to mention specific names because I would be upset to think I had missed someone. They are a wonderful team who should be proud of their achievement in creating a perfect holiday retreat. Food is created with culinary excellence where presentation is paramount and the Head Chef is always around the hotel and welcomes feedback. Rooms are immaculately kept by cleaning staff. The beach and pool area is serviced by a wonderful team who will find a lounger in your chosen area and ensure your comforts are met. If water sports are your thing then again the guys will assist you and will advise on weather conditions ensuring your safety at all times. They also offer an accompanied snorkeling trip just yards along the beach to see the turtles. This is a worthwhile experience for young and old.

This was our fifth visit to the hotel and we are already planning our sixth. We had a truly excellent holiday and the hotel scores excellent in most things with just a couple of things letting it down. First thing to say is the staff are amazing. Not sure if I \u2019ve ever met a more friendly bunch of people in a hotel anywhere. The new room refurbishments are very good. A much cleaner and brighter approach. Having tried all rooms including suites I still prefer the top floor of the first block. Looking over the palm trees at the beautiful sunset from the balcony was spectacular first night. Rooms circa 32324 are good. Beach and sea were stunning. I think the stretch of beach by the hotel is better than anywhere and it has an arc of buoys ensuring no boats can enter so it \u2019s more peaceful there. The water sports offered by the hotel are very good. Ryan took me and my wife out on a small sailboat which was excellent. There is snorkeling every morning with turtles wake boarding kayaks and much more. All free. The gym is pretty well equipped but on the small side and you do get quite a few gym bunnies in the morning getting beach readyBeach drinks service is excellent and they do a mean rum punch. Bottle of water is \u00a3 750 so be prepared for that. The breakfast has a decent choice of reasonable ingredients. Great location overlooking the sea. Annoyingly the fruit and fruit juices are not of great quality which seems bizarre. Unfortunately the birds that fly around there are a bloody nuisance and I advise you to check your chairs before sitting down. We had several shirts soiled this way. The biggest let down at the hotel is the evening bar restaurant scene not sure lunchtime is any beterI feel sorry for the hotel as they put on live performers and the staff are great. It \u2019s just nobody uses the restaurant. Ju ju and lone star are a very short walk down the beach and they just outperform the hotel in this area. Also a lot of people taxi to the fine dining spots around Holetown of which there are many. Not sure what they can do about that. Anyhow we \u2019ve thought about staying at Lone Star since we use it so much but to be honest that part of the beach is busier and noisier and you do n\u2019t get the water sports.

This was our second summer stay at this lovely resort one before and one after the renovation travelling as a family of four with two teen children. The Pavilion is a charmingly private brilliantly laid out hotel each room perfectly framing the beachfront and its pristine white sand and turquoise waters. The staff are professional kind and helpful and will cater to your every request. The rooms are clean modern and provide for your every need and want. The balconies are exceptional a spacious quiet place to read rest or enjoy a room service meal or glass of wine. The single biggest difference we noted in our two stays was that the calibre of the Taboras restaurant has fallen off significantly with the restaurant pricing no longer competitive with some of the other top restaurants we dined out during our stay. Our first stay we did not venture off the property as our meals were fantastic the service highly professional and charming and the food divine. While our room service meals this stay were excellent and the delivery staff just lovely the staff at the Taboras were slow we waited over 1 hour for a meal to be delivered lacking in polish and charm as compared to Lone Star and The Tides the food good but not wonderful and the cheque bigger than at their competitors who delivered 5 star service and food. I have read other reviews and know that I am not unique in this opinion. On a similar note the buffet breakfast is overpriced and somewhat lacks the charm it used to have in the Taboras restaurant with the omelette chef front and centre although I appreciate that may be because of the birds. Afternoon tea is a delight but again overpriced and as such a deterrent to taking advantage of more than the one time complimentary stay offer. The Pavilion would be incomparable if the dining were remedied.
