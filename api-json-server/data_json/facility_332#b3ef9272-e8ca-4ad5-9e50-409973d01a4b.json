One of the worst experiences I have had. The staff had no customer service skills. Reservations and website was very misleading. You pay nearly 400 for a night and expect that amenities for children to be included at the very least but everything had to be paid for separately. We were told to arrive early even though the check in time was at 4PM. The reservation agent said that we may check in early. We arrived just one hour prior to check in and no rooms were available and it seems that many other people were made the same promise as many other families were unhappily sitting waiting for rooms. We reserved for two sessions of JetLev at the Adventure Club at the time of arrival. Staff seemed to be upset very rude and never seemed to want to help anyone. At the time we arrived the following day 30 minutes before our scheduled flight time as we were instructed we paid for our session. Staff took photos of our identification on her personal phone. This was very concerning. We had then waited for staff to tell us what to do and where to go. No one seemed to know assist us. We went to the beach to find that the staff captain were no where to be found and learned 30 minutes later that the JetLev was not working never was working all morning. We paid and registered and no one had the decency to tell us that it was never working. We were excited to have this experience only to be disappointed that no one had any idea it was not working. If we knew this earlier we would have sought for the experience elsewhere. Upon our return to the Adventure Club desk I had to demand for a refund as they were not wishing to do so. In addition the staff that took photos on her personal phone of our IDs did not want to delete our IDs from her phone. This was ultimately the worst experience I have had at any resort if you can even call this one. I have had far greater experiences at a Holiday Inn. I would not recommend this place at all.

This was not our first time to the area but the first time at trade winds. I understand our time visiting was over the 4th of July which caused for added frustration on wait times but one of the reasons for choosing this location was the added extras for the resort fees. The added extras were not a benefit to us and often found little extra fees often associated. We did not eat at the resort but did like the fact that publix was close by and we could eat in our room during the day. The pools are advertised as being 5 pools to choose from with 2 additional pools at the sister resort Guy Harvey. All pools were over sized and exceeded their capiacity by three times at least all days. Seriously a resort that small and max capacity in pools the large pools mind you were 22 and 27. 2 other pool they advertised were hot tubs that could keep 4 people in and knees would be touchin g at that. Elevators were always boged down and could really benefit from having one or two in main areas of travel. I loved the area the sun sunsets the weather but this resort was just not for us.

We stayed for just a weekend wished it could have been longer. We entered with ease through the gated security to the porte cochere to check in. Got there around 2 pm and it was very crowded.

The kitchen is well equipped with full size refrigerator toaster. 2 burner stove microwave cofemaker coffee was supplied by housekeeping dishes glasses and silverware for 6 dish soap and dish clothes. Had a table that sat 3 sofa and a chair in the living room. The bathroom was clean however the tub needed some work. It was chipped and the material used to keep you from slipping looked dirty. We had double queen beds very comfortable and the pillows were very nice. Our Suite came with a small balcony that overlooked the pirate ship and the paddle boat river. We had a nice view of the gulf Recommend this room a bit pricey but nice. You do get a lot of resort amenities that come with this room. We had a great time at the lobby bar both evenings. The staff there is great. We rented the VIP cabana over the other ones because we had a party of 4 and wanted to have lunch. Great idea for a family. Only downside is that this cabana is at the Guy Harvey Outpost. Not convenient if you wanted anything from your room at the Island Grand Resort. It is a REAL Hike.

The staff went over and above for us and our guests for the entire week we were there. I can honestly say I never met one staff member that was not smiling and super friendly. Our first room was a bridal suite that was just perfect for getting ready for the wedding and moving to our second room was flawless with the help of staff as well. We came from MN site unseen and trusted that the Catering staff and vendors would just pull through for us and they did above and beyond that. The Wedding itself was on the beach and then at the gazebo area and it was planned out wonderfully to the last detail by Maria and Julie our wonderful event coordinators at TW. If you are looking for a destination spot for a wedding I highly recommend that area very private but great access to the resort as well.

The Trade Winds resort exceeded my expectations even with some significant drawbacks during our stay. Location location location sums up this property. Located right on the St Petes beach is provides a convenient beach resort experience. The resort is kept up well but it is design is a little long in the tooth. Built in a different era the rooms are smaller older and a little tight. My wife and I shared a room with two full sized beds and there would not have been room for another persons luggage. Internet is available and rooms have fridge and coffee service also. The beds were a little worn. my first night was like sleeping in a hole in the middle of the bed which was overly soft and offered no support. The HVAC labored in the FL heat and cycled on continually again not the modern quiet model but provided cool air. There are plenty of dining drinking option on property and many others within walking distance so you will not feel trapped. They also offer FREE self park or valet as a nominal cost. All the staff members were fantastic and would greet you around the property and were always willing to help point you in the right direction. Two areas of opportunity would be the quality of food during our conferences events was average at best. Despite the selection hot food needs to be hot not warm. The second issue was more concerning. You are allowed to charge items to your room by using your room key. The staff exercise proper security to prevent you from fraudulent charges and it really is a huge convenience. However when I compared my receipts with charges on my hotel bill I found that some transactions small tips were added on some charges and none on others. Overall the amount was small and I did not reconcile until I returned home but please make sure that you are familiar with the policies of the hotel and reconcile your bill before you leave the property to make sure your charges are consistent with your transactions.

We booked a few days a the Tradewinds Island Grand Resort to relax a little after a 14 day hectic vacation in Orlando.

We were told our bags would be taken to our room and we had be messaged when it was ready. We went off to explore and the first thing that hit us was the tiny size of the main pool which was extremely crowded and no lifeguard at any time. There was also an adult only quiet pool which was was full of loud adults drinking having fun and even noisier than the kids pool. The beach was really nice and as pictured in the marketing material. By 4 pm we had not been messaged I went and checked was then allocated a room and was told to follow the bell concierge I felt really awkward because it seemed obvious a second gratuity was expected of the second concierge after already paying the first 10Our room was a disappointment in that it was very dated in need of refurbishment and modernization and smelled damp and musty but it did appear reasonably clean. The air conditioning is effective but very loud and repeatedly woke us all in the night whenever it switched on. The room did however have a decent sized fridge and a sideways sea view through the buildings. The shower was good. The on site restaurants were varied and pretty expensive but the food was good.

All the staff were extremely friendly the ladies in the deli were particularly helpful and we enjoyed a chat with Holly in the foyer coffee shop bar one stormy evening when everything closed down. We heard that the hotel was just over half full but the pools and facilities were extremely busy the pools are just too small and unsupervised would hate to see them when the hotel is full capacity.
