We arrived on July 4th afternoon for a busy weekend at a Disney hotel for a dance competition. We booked here rather than the Disney hotel as it has no parking fee no resort fee and was much more reasonable then other hotels in the area. The staff was all very courteous and the hotel was well kept. We did not eat at the restaurant bar nor use any of the amenities on site as we were away from the hotel so much. The only problem we had was some of the guests were loud. I am not sure if they were louder than average or if the way the rooms are set up allows sound to travel but we could hear their conversation next door almost word for word. I called the front desk around 50 PM to let them know the neighbors had a loud TV and a lot of noise and asked if we could switch rooms. The hotel was booked for the 4th of July weekend so she could not move us but she said she would call the other room. We immediately heard their phone ringing numerous times before they answered and then we heard the man in the room using foul language and yelling about us calling about him. They did not turn the TV nor their voices down and continued to be loud and then we heard a dog yapping very loudly. I went to the front desk around 7 730 and said we would do whatever needed to be done to get away from this family. I asked them not to call again as the man was obviously angry about our first call. The desk clerk who called concurred that he had gotten angry at her and told her he was not the one making noise. I told them I would move and go wherever and whenever to not have to put up with their noise. We left to go out and not have to listen to them. Within one hour the hotel called and had moved us to a suite way on the other side of the hotel. I went back to the hotel and moved as quickly as I could. I really appreciated that they got right on the issue and worked to solve it. Obviously rude and disrespectful people are not something the hotel can control.
