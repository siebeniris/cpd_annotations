Great property in a perfect location staffed with friendly caring professionals. We had a one night stay in the city during school break. We were attracted to this property as we had an award night via Hotelscom and there was a room available. From the start they were great. We called a little after 1 pm to inquire about parking and if there was a room ready they charge 22 night for valet parking with free in and out privileges which is a whopping 2 more than self parking at the lot up the street wo the ability to use your car. And sure we can put you in a room right away. The room was very nice with a lovely couch area separated from the 2 beds. A nice big window lets in lots of light and has nice vertical drop sheers and blackout curtains to control the light. A good quality flat screen and a nice desk make the space useful. There is a mini fridge too. We loved the pool which is quite small but this is downtown Portland which was clean and perfect for my little guy. They serve a really great breakfast too. With surprisingly high quality food on a really nice buffet spread. But every interaction with the staff is what really makes this a terrific property. They are all pros well trained and courteous but not automatons. My one criticism would be that the shower tub set up is maybe a bit dated although light years away from being nasty or unsatisfying. We have stayed at the Residence Inn in Bath a few times and they have these amazing walk in showers that I want to copy for my home bathroom remodelAl in all I would certainly stay here again if we get the chance.

After looking at the hotel \u2019s web site and reading many positive online reviews about the hotel we were looking forward to our stay. Unfortunately our experiences were more negative than positive. Our interactions with Kevin Carole and the shuttle drivers were the only positive aspect of our stay. From the moment that we phoned the hotel to request a ride from the train station to the last time that we conversed with him on our way to breakfast on the day that we checked out Kevin was helpful pleasant efficient and courteous as were Carole and the shuttle drivers. In our room the toilet seat was broken and the sink drain was clogged. The next morning we reported these two issues to Kevin who had them corrected immediately. Some of the finish was worn off of the bath tub and the tiles as well as part of the bathroom floor need attention. Our room provided a great view of the HVAC units and the multi level parking area. Both mornings the eggs and the accompanying foods that were supposed to be served hot as well as the waffles were cold even though we arrived in the breakfast area around 730 am. The second morning there were no spoons or knives. When I asked the female who appeared to be in charge of the breakfast area if there was cream cheese she stupidly responded \u201c We have Nutela today \u201d for bagels. Obviously Nutela is offered all of the time along with jelly for example. I had seen packets of cream cheese about five minutes before I had asked. When we returned to our room at around 630 pm on the second evening after a long day of sightseeing we found that it had not been touched by housekeeping so we phoned the front desk where our call was taken by Mike. In an accusatory fashion he asked if we had left the \u201c do not disturb \u201d sign on the door which we had not. He then said that he would \u201c send someone up with towels \u201d. I responded that in addition to clean towels we wanted the bathroom cleaned the beds made and the trash emptied. When no one had arrived within 15 minutes I phoned again at which time Mike assured me that he would \u201c get someone there right away \u201d. After another 15 minutes had elapsed which was a half hour after our initial call I went to the front desk and reported to Carole what had transpired. Mike was nowhere to be found. I overheard both sides of the conversation when Carole phoned the \u201c houseman \u201d. The \u201c houseman \u201d sounded belligerent he told Carole something like he would take care of our room when he got around to it. Following this I returned to our room then we left the hotel for at least a half hour. When we returned someone finally was making up our room. He did not empty one of the trash receptacles. Almost two hours after our initial call we finally were able to use our room undisturbed. We previously had arranged a late check out with the front desk so we put the \u201c do not disturb \u201d sign on the door on the day of our departure. Despite the arrangement and the sign a member of the housekeeping staff knocked on our door about a half hour before our designated check out time. I informed him of our check out time then he left. We checked out shortly before the designated time and stored our luggage at the hotel before we again left the hotel for about an hour. When we returned we sat in the lobby while we waited to take the shuttle to the train station. From the seating area I overheard Mike in the reception area loudly laughing to his male colleague that the evening before a female called the front desk to complain that her room had not been made up and that she \u201c yelled \u201d her expectation that the room be made up immediately because \u201c she wanted to relax \u201d. Several of Mike \u2019s statements were beyond exaggerations they were lies. After a couple of minutes I calmly walked over to Mike and told him that I was the female who had phoned and that I did not \u201c yell \u201d. His face turned bright red and when he denied saying some of what he had just told his colleague I assured him that I would be reporting his unprofessional conduct to Hyat my letter is in the mail. I then walked back to the seating area. If my rating concerned only Kevin Carole and the shuttle drivers it would be five rather than two. My rating of two may be overly generous considering all of the negative issues.", "offset": [3074, 3124], "date": "2018-05-20", "cpt": "2", "category": "general"}, {"id": 23, "uid": "151c7f45-b5d2-41ff-aee8-4ed73181649d", "sentence": "The hotel was great. the view from our room was spectacular and the room had ceiling to floor windows.

The hotels location could not be better right on Fore St in the heart of the city and all its great restaurants and sights.

Going back out again I had lunch at a new spot Black Cow nearby and went about exploring this compact city. Back at the hotel around 5 I went down to have a cocktail and found that while the bar is fully functional there is no real food to be had the bartender explained she could cook up something as long as it had chicken shredded pork or flat bread included but there was no real menu or dining options at the hotel. Not the biggest deal as the hotel is surrounded by a range of dining spots ranging from pizza burgers lobster shacks local bars to 4 Star establishments.

We visited mid week so we had no problems with noise but note if you get the harbor view right across the street is a nightclub with pounding techno music which despite the window glass a light sleeper could probably hear so if that is you request a city view room. Hotel is right downtown so convenient walk to shops restaurants harbor and attractions. Furnishings in the room are fresh and modern. Bottom line was great stay and I will be back.", "offset": [220, 418], "date": "2018-10-02", "cpt": "3", "category": "general"}, {"id": 34, "uid": "69290eb9-a97b-42be-b399-0289d22d23c7", "sentence": "One night leisure stay.

This caused power outages across the city. The hotel used a backup generator for some things but there was no heat for the rest of our stay. The make matters worse there was no communication on when power would come back on until the following night almost 24 hours after losing power. The hot continental breakfast that was promised for our stay was not hot at all it was leftover donuts yogurt with fruit and limited amounts of coffee. I actually went out to get breakfast the second morning because of how disappointing it was. Of course losing power is not the hotels fault but there was no effort made by the staff to make us feel more comfortable or even just to keep us in the loop of what was going on. Overall I paid full price for a hotel room that did not have heat for 80 of the stay there was no breakfast and the hotel made no effort to rectify the situation.", "offset": [596, 775], "date": "2019-10-23", "cpt": "4", "category": "general"}, {"id": 41, "uid": "45d0a17f-3cce-410e-addb-a01cbd97c241", "sentence": "Old port.

Arriving to Hyat Place Portland Old Port the location was incredible. It is right downtown and right in the middle of the action. We were greeted with smiles at the front desk and they were prompt with checking in. We went up to our port view room which I paid extra for and as it was spacious the port view was not there. our view was of the buildings around us not wait I paid for. Other than our view the room was clean and beautiful. We had a couple mile walk around downtown Portland and came back to our room after dinner. It was quiet and the night sky was beautiful. I did see reviews before our trip about the club across the street being extremely loud but it was not. It was a light sound in the background we fell asleep fine. The bed was a bit hard for our liking but it was a fine sleep. Overall I give Hyat Place Portland Old Port a 4 out of 5. I highly recommend this hotel for a romantic stay in Portland.", "offset": [695, 754], "date": "2020-03-15", "cpt": "4", "category": "general"}]}
