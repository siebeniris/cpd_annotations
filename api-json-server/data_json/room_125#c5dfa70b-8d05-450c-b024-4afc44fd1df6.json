I booked my room for 4 nights. Upon check in everything was ready to go. I was checked in very quickly. I was on the 3rd floor and was apprehensive about having to wait on the elevator a long time but this was not the case. It was very quick every time. There are alot of contractors that stay here while doing jobs locally but all my experiences with them were great. Unlike other guests who acted like this was an issue when they reviewed this hotel I found them quite pleasant and rarely there anyway because they work all day. All emenities in the room functioned as they should except for the faucet in the bathroom. I had hot and cold water but the lines were reversed. So initially I thought I had no hot water but when I went to brush my teeth I found the hot water on the right side instead of the left side like normal. Kinda comical but not inconvenient at all. I do not know the staffs names but I was treated great from the time I arrived until check out. The night clerks even offered tips on helping me to fall asleep. I was having difficulty going to sleep even before my stay. Free breakfast was good and I consumed many of the sausage patties they were great. Fresh fruits and breads available topped it all off nicely. There was events going on in the conference center parties really but they did not interrupt my sleep or my stay at all. Everyone was having a good time. The hotel is a lil dated but kept up. Thumbs up and many kudos to the ladies on overnight shift.", "offset": [38, 68], "date": "2016-10-19", "cpt": "0", "category": "room"}, {"id": 6, "uid": "8b45d295-fc2c-4c6b-91ae-c0d293506af4", "sentence": "Checked in was fine and friendly.

I honestly do not want to stay here tonight and really wish I could ask for my money back. I stayed at Home wood by Hilton hotel last night and it was amazing. We decided to stay together another night so we looked for something cheaper and found this. To start when I pulled in the place looked as if it was not operating. I pulled to the front of the door and had to back all the way out because the staff had their cars parked right in front of the door. The lady at the front desk had the nastiest attitude. I do not remember her but she has full lips a ring in her lip she smokes cigarettes and drives a silver altima that is beat up along the side. the Hall way smelled horrible and the elevator was worst. The front desk agent stressed the fact that there was to be no smoking. but the hallways reaked of cigarette smoke. Everything appeared to be out of order. The recycling bins etc were nasty as hell. We booked at about 1 pm and came back around 3 and our room was still being cleaned. The housekeeping lady was very nonchalant but she did try to call the front desk and no one answered BC the staff was outside smoking. We had to walk all the way back to the front desk. No ever apologized or anything. The inside of just makes my skin crawl. I really just want to leave and go somewhere else but I am sure i would have to move mountains in order for that to happen.

When I finally did get an answer and asked why he made up the story that I was smoking I honestly think he was trying to charge my card for his own personal benefit.
