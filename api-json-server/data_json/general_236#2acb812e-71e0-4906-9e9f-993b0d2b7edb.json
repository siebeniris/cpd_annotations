Hotel a bit stuffy. First of all let me start out by saying we stayed at this property for 6 nights during July. The hotel is in a great location close to the freeways restaurants and shopping. The room we had was clean and relatively quiet. The staff however was very formal and stuffy. We found the staff did not always greet us and seemed a bit put out to get the door for us as we were coming and going. We have stayed at several Ritzs before along with Four Seasons and other luxury brand hotels. We have paid a lot more per night at other resorts with staff that was a lot friendlier than at this location. Although the hotel was nice I would probably choose the Westin right down the road if staying in this area again. Same location and probably better staff.

Had a quick one night stay recently and nothing has changed for the worse from my epic experience 20 years ago sans the head chef. As the AJC reports. For 22 years Seeger who previously rendered his first name as \u2018 Guenter \u2019 occupied an unequaled place in Atlanta \u2019s dining world. The chef who had earned a Michelin star in his native Germany arrived stateside in the 1980s to upgrade the restaurant at the Ritz Carlton \u2019s hotel chain \u2019s flagship property in Buckhead. Upgrade he did. While at The Dining Room Seeger received frequent national press and became the first Atlanta chef to earn a James Beard award. The night was a special one. I was proposing to my wife a physician and pretending the dinner and stay where a dog and pony show from IBM trying to win me over a 2 million dollar contract. I had called the hotel the day before to book the room pre internet. I told the reservationist I would be proposing over dinner. The rate was 300. She upgraded me to a junior suite for free an over 300 upgrade. She booked a table for us even though there where no reservations left. We arrived 5pm after work and checked in. Dinner was at 7 and we had a cocktail and made fun of ourselves for making it to this place in our lives. When we arrived at the dining room the host knew my name and acted as if I was a well known customer. I played along and my wife to be was impressed. Guenter himself came out shaking my hand and saying good to see you my old friend and asked my date if she had any food allergies. He then introduced us to Michael McNeil Master Sommelier he was the first and for several years the only Master Sommelier in the State of Georgia. Michael said the chef and him where creating a special 6 course meal and wine pairing. The service all night was amazing. The meal of course a once in a lifetime experience. The wines complimented each dish with almost magical qualities. Full buzzed and shaking like a leaf. the dining room staff chef and Michael all gathered around while I handed her a champagne glass. I had the wedding band around the stem of a champagne glass I had a glass blower create. I proposed she accepted the restaurant patrons erupted in applause. Guests of the restaurant or maybe the hotel itself payed for our meal and Michael brought up to the room a 1982 Dom compliments of him and Chef Seeger.

I have been living at this hotel for nearly three months. it is for work and after looking at corporate housing I decided that if I could not be at home at least I could have turn down service.

I lived through the changeover from a Ritz property to a Luxury Collection property and it was so terribly executed that I would move out if I was actually paying the bill.

No memos stating that the menu at the bar and restaurant would change I had a Dealers Choice four times a week for two months and it is been replaced by a lame Cosmopolitan knock off called The Local. No memos stating there would no longer be a piece of chocolate on your pillow and an inspirational video playing on your television after your 14 hour work day. And nothing saying that your key card would need to be replaced on December 1st the day of the switch over. Seriously these are simple pieces of paper that can left in your room. But nothing. I also think that this hotel seriously lacks an outdoor area that is not covered in cigarette butts and splintered deck furniture. I was going to write a review about how this property was a bit tired when I first checked in and could use a facelift. But then I learned they had already redone the bar and it is awful. There are pillars that they designed for seating at the bar and if you are behind them you will NEVER BE SEEN. So I decided they should not be encouraged to modernize because if the bar was an example of the new aesthetic it would be tragic.
