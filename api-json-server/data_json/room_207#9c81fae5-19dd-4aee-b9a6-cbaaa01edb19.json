We booked a standard room as we were only staying one night as we were up there to see a show. We booked this hotel as it was reasonably priced and the location was spot on being just a short stroll from Gloucester Road underground station so we could use the cycle district line from Victoria train station and the Picadily line to get and back from our show and then the cycle district line back to Victoria train station when ready to leave Sunday. This hotel is also near enough to the museums and as we did take a nice walk through the park to visit Kensington Palace and many other things in the parks as all these are within easy walking distance from this hotel. We checked in and was told we have given you a free upgrade to an executive room on the 27th floor. We thanked the lady on reception for this and after a painless check in we headed to the lift to find our executive room. We arrived opened the door and straight away noticed we now had a queen bed instead of a double we had booked in a standard room. The view from our room stretched all the way to the wembley stadium which could be seen in the distance. We also had tea coffee to drink two bottles of water and a kit kat chocolate bar. Sue had the use of a hairdryer and there was free to use shower gel shampoo and body lotion face clothes towels. We had a very good nights sleep in the large queen bed and was surprised being that high up the underground traffic could still be heard. However it did not keep us awake at all. The hot water was there when wanted and after returning from the theatre Sue asked if we could have any more milk and the man on reception gave her more straight away which in other hotels has not always been the case. Our check out was both as friendly handled as our check in and also we found there is a luggage room so we were able to leave our case and collect it later. Therefore from our first visit to this hotel and receiving a free upgrade we have no complaints at all and will be booking again for our next London weekend visit later in the year. If we do stay in a standard room I will review it for you then.

Being jet lag and exhausted from flying overnite from NJ we crashed on the lobby sofas and didnt have our rooms ready til 230. It was very difficult to understand the accent of the front desk worker even though she was friendly and called repeatedly to see why our rooms were not ready. You can tell this place. people are not well trained they never offered me additional room keys or user i d password for free wifi that you only get if you are and IHG hotel member which I am. I called 3 times from my room and each time recd different info. Finally went downstairs with my ipad and had them do it for me and explain it in person. Next I had to get new keycards because ours stopped working after one day. The Starbucks worker in the lobby while friendly got our drink wrong. The rooms are small dated and can use updating. The shower was starting to clog towards the end of our stay. My daughters rooms a c was not working it was too cold no matter how they set it. the sliding bathroom door didnt shut all the way.

We had a king and if we rolled to close to center we could feel the center seam of the bed which was two twins pushed together to make a king. We had children with us and so had a room with a single sofa bed in it. This was actually more comfy than the king bed. We did do the buffet breakfast and have to say the choices were pretty good and the staff was extremely helpful and friendly. There was something for everyone and we were able to leave and sightsee with full bellies. They do serve Starbucks coffee in the lobby and prices seem comparable to the Starbucks that is across from the underground.

It was always fully stocked with soda and beer and wine. It had a nice selection of finger foods at night. The breakfast buffet had a great selection.

It is very well located right in the heart of Kensington which makes it very useful for tourists and similarly I \u2019m sure business people. Upon our arrival just before 9 pm after a long journey from Cornwall the concierge desk greeted us warmly however as this was a business trip 4 rooms had been booked for 4 people but under one name which they really struggled to understand even after showing our booking confirmation. After 30 minutes we finally got there. By this point we were very hungry and were looking forward to getting to the hotel restaurant for some food. We were advised it was open until 10 pm. Perfect so we dropped our bags in our room and came down to be told the restaurant was closed. Fortunately though we could still order in the bar \u2013 but could n\u2019t use the discount vouchers they had given us on reception. The service was very good and the food nice \u2013. so no complaints thereWhen my manager booked she was upgraded to an Executive Suite.

But it was surprising that it took so long. I would also recommend asking for a room away from the lifts as the noise did also keep me awake. It was great to have the curtains in the room that are black out so a sleep in is possible for those who can. Breakfast was great \u2013 with a good selection of food from a full English to continental. The waitresses served our tea and coffee quickly once seated. However it was a shame that you had to try and get the waitresses attention for a top up. It would be great to have a pot to enjoy. I had time to enjoy their gym which though small and quite hot down in the basement but it was well equipped.

I decided to stay at this hotel as I had n\u2019t tried it before and believe me saying this hotel is horrendous is an understatement. I checked in on Thursday the 13th December and checked out on the 15th. The first problems arise when I had my bag stolen away from the hotel and when getting back on the evening of the 13th had no life on my phone battery and had asked if I could borrow an iPhone charger. Now I am sure we live in a communication era but was told they had no charger I could borrow to charge my phone I do wonder now many the maids find when cleaning rooms. I then tried to make an outside call from my room and this did n\u2019t work I then tried to do it from reception at which point they told me they could n\u2019t get an outside line from the reception desk. So the 21st century in a hotel with no form of communication bizareThe problems continue. I then came back to my room on the 14th for my second evening to find water and a kit kat had been left in my room but then they decided nothing else needed to be done so my room was left not cleaned. I took this up with reception an hey agreed to change my room to one that was ready 2 doors away this process took half an hour when I was trying to get ready to go out. When I return on the evening of the 14th I wanted to order room service breakfast surprise surprise. no hanger on the door to do this. How long would it take to get another card I wondered I rang reception by the way they never answer the phone so had to go to reception. It took another half an hour to get a card to order my breakfastOn the morning of the 15th I was so relived to be leaving this god awful place and the lady on the reward desk asked if I had a pleasant stay at which point I explained my problems. She then spoke to somebody who said that 500 reward points would be credited to my account anybody want to guess if this has been done. NOI have since I got back sent an email and rung about 6 times to get an invoice as this was n\u2019t given to me and also to make sure the points would be credited you guessed it no one is responding or answering the phone.
