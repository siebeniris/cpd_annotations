This was our first time at Riu Resort our vacation operator Sunwing Vacations rates it as a 5 star. I am not sure what decade their review was written but we were deeply disappointed and unfortunately it is evident as soon as you enter the reception lobby. The hotels overall decor is poorly out dated including the basic guest amenities such as room keys as opposed to RFID cards or electronic swipe cards a separate manual key for the in room safe rather than a touch keyboard or cc card swipe option safe is too small to fit a 15 laptop no pull out bed in our junior suite and minimal water pressure in shower to name a few. The nightly activity is the SAME every night with a local entertainment show and band playing local music in the courtyard. absolutely no variety. This hotel does not have a nightclub which means you would have to take a taxi to another Riu resort. So rather than take a chance we opted to go the Hard Rock Punta Cana 2x during our 7 day trip and had a great time. A return ride will run you USD40 excluding tip for 4 pl but you will not be disappointed if you are looking for entertainment. However I will commend the hotel staff all members were friendly and welcoming to the guests.

Overall our stay did not live up to the expectation of a resort with an overall 4 star rating. The rooms are nice size for an extended stay but the beds were not very comfortable and the pillows flat. The biggest negatives were the quality of the food and the entertainment. The buffet food was marginal at best and a lot of it was downright terrible dry overcooked tasteless. Lots of food options but we rarely found anything that was really tasty. The sit down restaurants are a pain to get into. You must sign up between 8 11 each morning and the reservations go fast even during off season. In 5 nights we only ate at 2 of the sit down restaurants. The Brazilian steak house was acceptable and some of the meat was tasty but once again a lot was dry and bland. Our best meal was at the Krystal restaurant. The crevice was great as was the sea bass. The pool was nice size but many tiles need to be replaced and swarms of bees hover around the sweet open drinks. One lady was bitten and had an allergic reaction and was told there was no Benadryl at the on site medical center. Luckily we brought some with us and could help her out. The biggest plus was the staff who were all kind and helpful. The water quality was much less than expected. Brown with sand and you could not snorkel near the hotel at all. Lots of beach chairs for both sun and shade were available. The Reef Explorer excursion was a total let down too. Not a real reef just a floating dock with open pins stocked with some marine life.

We visited the hotel Riu Palace Punta Cana in July 2015 myself and my boyfriend it was our first holiday together we arrived at the hotel after a long flight and had a lovely welcome given a nice cocktail from the waitress as we entered the hotel. When we got to the reception it was a free for all the men receptionist behind the reception disk we just talking among themselves and defiantly were in no hurry to check us in. Finally after an half hour wait maybe even longer we were allocated our room. We left the reception to find our room when we finally found our room the cleaners had literally started to clean our room so my boyfriend went back to the reception desk to ask if we could have a room which was already cleaned as it was around 4 pm and we just wanted to put our bags down and hit the pool. He returned and we had been moved to another room so we found our room and when we entered there was no bed sheets covers or towels. At this stage I was becoming slightly annoyed so I went back to the reception and asked for another room with bedding and towels. The receptionist behind the desk walked me to another room this room was beautiful right at the back of the hotel a beautiful view of the pool beach the only problem was that it was first floor and I had requested for a high floor room but at this point I really was not too fussed. We thanked the gentlemen and started to unpack we were about to leave and put our belonging in the safe when I released that the lock on the safe was broken. not happy so my boyfriend yet again walked back to the reception and the receptionist said that we would have to wait for the maintenance guy to come and fit the lock which meant that we could not leave the room because of our belongs passports and money. we waited for yet another hour for the maintenance guy to arrive. Not a great start to the holidayWe did not have any other problems on the holiday the food was ok pretty much the same every night after spending two weeks I was glad to leave I have been on many all inclusive holidays before but the food here was simple the most basic and repetitive. Also do not waste your time to visit any off the La carte restaurants total waste of time. we actually left two off the la carte restaurant as the food was very poor and we headed to the food hall. Everyday on the beach there were mountains of seaweed that washed ashore and the sea was completely filled of seaweed. each day around 1 pm there was a big yellow bulldozer which dough holes along the shore right where people where sitting on sun loungers and playing in the sea. the bulldozer dough round 3 holes and then lifted the seaweed from the beach and put it into the holes and dough over it this happened every day from 1 pm and lasted for an hour or so until it moved along to beach to another spot not really a relaxing paradise a big yellow bulldozer driving up and down the seafront removing the seaweed and I must add the smell of the seaweed was very unpleasant. The evening entertainment was poor make sure you take a pack of playing cards. The hotel is a beautiful looking hotel and the grand gardens are very well kept and very beautiful.

First of all the service staff is absolutely wonderful. I have no complaints and nothing but praise for how they treated us during our vacation. However the people at the front desk are another story. We added an additional traveler after booking our flight and hotel. When we called RIU palace Bavaro to add another person they told us to do it when we got there. Now we know why. We could paid them 60 in cash without a receipt or 90 if we used a credit card and got a receipt. Obviously they \u2019re going to pocket the 60. Without a receipt we did n\u2019t want to be stuck at the end of the vacation with them telling us we never paid and ask for the 60 again. So we paid with credit card. The room I requested for 2 adults and a teenager was to have two double beds. When we got there they had no such rooms available. We were stuck with one bed and one pullout couch which was the most uncomfortable sleep for a week my teenager ever had. The room which was nice and kept very clean the phone never worked we could not adjust the temperature the refrigerator was never cold and after repeated requests to have them serviced they never were. I was surprised that we never ever had to wait to get into one of the specialty restaurants. But after eating at them I now know why. The food was absolutely terrible. We decided to eat at the specialty restaurants because the buffet which is open to all was absolutely terrible. Nice presentation but absolutely no taste. I know what to expect from resorts foods. But this was sub par in comparison to the ones we \u2019ve stayed at in Jamaica and Cancun. I have read reports of people seeing cockroaches. I am happy to say that we never saw any. And again the rooms were kept very clean the service providers house keeping and bartenders. at the resort were wonderful. It \u2019s the resort itself that I have issue with trying to pocket 60 for an additional guests and never attending to the issues we had with the room made it a very unpleasant vacation. Perhaps retaliation for not giving them the 60 in cash. I \u2019ve stayed at many all inclusive resorts and I understand what to expect outside of the United States. But in this case I \u2019m just asking to have gotten what I paid for and what was promised by the resort. a bed for each of us to sleep in a refrigerator that was cold a working phone that we could use to contact other people we were traveling with not being conned as we walked through the front door.", "offset": [550, 683], "date": "2018-07-22", "cpt": "0", "category": "family"}, {"id": 9, "uid": "cef5f285-d9ed-4e61-ba08-b95cc673fad2", "sentence": "My honest opinion.

Where do I begin. Went down with my wife and 8 year old son from NYC July 2019. Check in was a breeze thanks to Orlando and Nathaniel. Beautiful room over looking the Ocean and pools. Most rooms however will have a courtyard view. Air Conditioning was awesome. The warm ocean breeze made it very comfortable on the patio. The cleaning service was thorough and quick. Estaban I believe kept Our refrigerator full all week particularly with beer and bottled water. Even left us a bottle of champagne one night without a request. Nice touch. The only thing I did n\u2019t care for was only a shower not tub and only a half a door. other than that the room was beautiful. Onto the food. Excellent. Specialty restaurants are good. You can get anything from the daily buffet fresh everything. We all have different likes so the buffet was a hit with us. Our server Audis and Diaz were phenomenal. Not only were they super friendly warm and inviting the took to time to keep my son busy and laughing. these 2 guys were awesome and deserving of a raise. So tip them well. The buffet and Pepe \u2019s Snack Shack were conveniently located near all the pools and beach front excellent for on the go eating as well. The pool bar Alfredo and Proqui were outstanding. folks I \u2019m not lying when I say A small tip goes a long way. They had my drink starting before I even said anything. RIU employees never ever asked for any sort of gratuity nor are they allowed as far as I am aware but I believe EVERY employee I came across deserves something. RIU has a small 6 slide water park perfect for an hour or 2. This was great for my son who kept busy and he loved every minute of the park. The beach is beautiful. A bit rough and some seaweed but the warm ocean breeze air was unbelievable. Be careful of the local merchants. For the most part if you say no right away they will back off. These people are NOT RIU employees. Any exotic animal beach go\u2019er will allow you to take a picture with the animal but then demand. Do n\u2019t fall for their act. Anyway With all the news in America with sickness and other things in Dom Repub this Place was perfect relaxing fun and enjoyable. You as a traveler must always be on guard no matter what country you go. I thought for many years I would not go to DR. Well. I \u2019m planning another trip for next year as we speak. I WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THE RIU PALACE as it has something for everyone. Quiet areas for couples and family areas for family \u2019s and party areas for all. This property tends to attract many European but America take notice. We had a great time at the RIU Punta Cana. I also recommend using Olympus Tours as your ground transfer. Quick clean friendly.

I spend 15 days here with my girlfriend. We booked a junior suite via TUI. Here is what we think of our trip Pool areaThe pool area is quite big with plenty of sunbeds in the water as well as around the pool. Even though reserving a sunbed is not permitted somehow every morning a lot of sunbeds were already \u201c claimed \u201d with a towel even before the pool opened. However there are still a lot of decent beds left so no need to worry. There are plenty of spots which offer shade however I would not recommend using the \u201c traditional \u201d parasols for protection against sunburn. Their net like structure keeps the heat away but not the burn. The hotel provides a free of charge towel service so no need to bring your own beach towel. Save those kilos for sunscrenThe polbar was nice there were plenty of tables and seats however there were also a lot of children splashing around getting water into your drink. I know this is mainly the responsibility of the parents but maybe they should just not allow children inside a pool area were alcoholic beverages are served especially when there are many other pools that can be used to splash and jump and play. Beach areaThe beach is beautiful due to the palm trees and the white sand. As other reviews mentioned there is a seaweed problem. However there are many people working really hard to clean the seaweed every day sometimes multiple times a day. So we ca n\u2019t really blame the hotel for this. Most of the time there were at least some hours during the day where the seaweed was all ashore and you could swim without being touched. There are many sunbeds however some could use some maintenance. There are no parasols here so if you want shade you should use a palm tree. RomAs mentioned above we stayed in a junior suite standard room. The room was spacious with large beds 2 separate beds air conditioning and plenty of storage room for your clothes and other stuff. A downside to the room is that there is a lot of noise coming from the gallery hallway. It seemed to mainly come through the door the walls seemed to be soundproof. The minibar was ok however we found during our stay that the diversity of drinks went down. Food drinkDrinks are being served at the pool area as well as the beach. So you do n\u2019t even have to get up to get a drink which is great. A special drink is the \u201c Samy Sosa \u201d a cocktail dedicated to the famous Dominican baseball player. There are a few places you can get some food. The pool bar BQ is nice if you just want to grab a quick snack. The lunch buffet was ok somewhat diverse. The breakfast was great with plenty of choice. We really strongly recommend the pancakes OMG those are delicious. As for dinner we went to each a la carte restaurant as well as the buffet. The buffer is ok it is better to go early in the evening to get the best quality of food. The Italian restaurant was ok good food and a lot of choices. The Spanish restaurant was equally good if not slightly better. We did prefer the setting of the Italian restaurant over the Spanish one. Then there is the Japanese restaurant. Out of all this one was our least favorite not due to the service but due to the taste of the food. Maybe it \u2019s personal. Then there was the steakhouse which was nice simple meat. And finally there was the fusion restaurant. This was our favorite I would even go as far as to say that the beef here was better than in the steakhouse. Out of all the restaurants this setting felt most like a restaurant. For the a la carte restaurants there may not be a table ready for you right away. You will not have to wait in queue they will write down your name and give you a beeper. A general note We really missed a bit of background music in the restaurants especially the a la carte ones. When there were not that many people it was very quiet even a little awkward. EntertainmentDuring the daytime there are plenty of activities you can do. We did not care for them but the animation team really tries. At the polbar there was a DJ every day at 160 which was nice. We also went to the aqua park. There are plenty of slides to choose from as well as plenty of sunbeds. There also was a pool for little kids. There is a possibility to get some drinks but it \u2019s limited. We felt a little disappointed to find out that there is no normal pool there in which you can just swim. It is only slides so we got bored relatively quick. This is not a place you can sit or relax the whole day maybe an hour. A sidenote. The tiles were extremely hot so bring your flip flops. We also went to the polparty multiple times. The music is a little bit loud. I did not mind but my girlfriend brought her earplugs. They have this sort of cabinet thing around the pool in which you can put your flip flops other stuff. The setting is nice especially during the evening parties were they make good use of their lights. There is also plenty of room to chill inside the pool as well as some tables outside the pool. We would recommend wearing swimwear why else would you go to a pool party. On the downside the music is nice but limited. They seem to be using the same playlist in the same order every night which got a little boring after 4 visits. ServiceThe people are very friendly. Shout out to the gardeners who work really hard to keep the garden perfect. Also a shout out to the people who clean the seaweed from the beachTipsOur big advice is bringing cash to tip the staff. We recommend not bothering with the local currency since you are not allowed to import or export it. Just get yourself a pile of 1 US dollar bills and you are set. We usually tipped the following on a daily basis 2 dollars to the housekeeping beware the minibar is filled by a different person so if you want to tip him as well leave some money inside the minibar. 1 2 dollars at breakfast 1 dollar every couple of rounds of drinks we got at the pool beach depending on how often and quick they were and usually 2 dollar at dinner. both a la carte and bufetTiping is not required however it will make your experience a lot better. For example we got the same table at breakfast every day with drinks already on their way as soon as we walked in the guy at the pol beach knew what we wanted and kept bringing drinks nice and fast. Also we would like to mention that there is no \u201c standard tip \u201d they are happy with everything. Do not skip the pineapple. We are from Europe and we have never ever tasted pineapple like this. If pineapple was the only food available in the whole resort I would not even be mad. 1010 would recommend to other people.", "offset": [110, 243], "date": "2019-07-22", "cpt": "1", "category": "family"}, {"id": 16, "uid": "1eb8a007-572e-445d-b46b-d1c48415ab47", "sentence": "3rd visit.

DiRoche and Antonio were beyond gracious servers. They found us everyday and ensured we had a table for 5 plenty of drinks and a clean table. We all looked forward to seeing them everyday. Very little to complain about. The pool water was maybe a bit too warm. And maybe too small for the amount of guests staying at the resort. We were hoping for more \u201c activities \u201d to enjoy during the day and early evening at the pool but that \u2019s just something we are accustomed to after staying at other places. It was n\u2019t missed otherwise. The beach was clean and we always found a spot for all of us. The vendors were there since it \u2019s a public beach but were n\u2019t as pushy as they were the last time we were there. All in all it was a great vacation and I would highly recommend this location for sure. If we choose to visit Punta Cana again this will be our go to place for sure.

We travelled from London on a direct flight with Tui. We were delighted with our choice of hotel. We were the final drop off from the airport and as the coach stopped along the way to drop people off the hotels appeared to get progressively better. When we arrived at ours it was so impressive that we were immediately drained of any travel fatigue and ready to relax. There was a mix up with our rooms and the guy on reception graciously upgraded our room with very little persuasion more a hint that we had be happy to accept an upgrade. The room was fantastic and faced inwards towards the palm lined fountains and just felt like paradise. The pools the bars the restaurants and the sea with sandy beach were just brilliant. We were there at the end of August in 2019 which is widely reported as hurricane season but aside from a bit of rain in the middle of the night we experienced warm sunshine everyday ranging from 28c to 32c. Which was plenty hot enough for us and our ten year old son. Because this hotel is on the Riu complex with at least four other Riu hotels probably more you can walk along the beach and pop in to the other hotels and grab a drink or a bit of lunch. there is also a small street with some quaint shops selling things a little cheaper than the shop in the hotel. I had whole heartedly recommend this hotel to friends and family and when we have run out of places to go I am sure we will be back as a family too.", "offset": [1320, 1468], "date": "2019-09-05", "cpt": "1", "category": "family"}, {"id": 19, "uid": "7b7c0c73-226e-4f2c-a4dc-cf877f1b3a55", "sentence": "Excellent customer service. The girl is beautiful very clean great food and side restaurants are all really good. But the highlight is the customer service. I dropped my drone on the roof and the manager Alexandro himself helped me and got his staff to retrieved it right away. My mother in law was sick and they accommodate my wife to stay extra days because she had to commute to the hospital every day. All the cleaning ladies were helpful and get what you need as soon as you make requests.
