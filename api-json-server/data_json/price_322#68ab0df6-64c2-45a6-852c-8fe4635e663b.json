A beautiful Birthday white set up with candles was arranged by the hotel with a 14 course delicious dinner by chef Francis chef Pradep. Their huge breakfast menu offers nutritious organic breakfast corner and freshly squeezed juices along with the regular choices. Their South Indian Chef Raju made sure we had our kind of oil free variety of dosas every day. Saleh their food beverage manager made sure if all our needs are met with. Their newly opened Signature restaurant Swarna is a must must place to find the difference in the not so normal but unique tasty and excellently presented indian food with the back drop of live performance of sitar and tabla. My compliments to Chef Rahul for his excellence in presenting the 25 different varieties of indian cuisine in elegance and style in a Thali.

My husband and I had the most amazing honeymoon at Jumeriah Vitaveli. There was a smiling staff member going above and beyond from the moment we stepped off of the plane. After a short and beautiful boat ride from Male Airport we were received a warm welcome on the dock followed by a tour of the resort from our personal concierge Majid. Our room was n\u2019t quite ready since it was a morning flight so Majid had us setting into one of their spa rooms. It was wonderful to be able to take a shower and a nap for my husband after a long flight. Our room was a sunset villa that was absolutely beautiful very clean and the outdoor space and pool were much larger than expected. Majid took care of making all or our dinner reservations as well as scheduling our diving excursions and basically anything else we needed. The island had a very romantic and peaceful vibe. Even though the it was at 80 occupancy we were always able to get prime seating at the pool sun or shade restaurant reservations at the time we wanted and were able to participate in diving and paddle boarding at our desired time. My husband and I agreed that the food was better than expected. We woke up early to have a long breakfast with a beautiful view at Samsara. On our first morning we were greeted by Norbelyn at the omelet station who made us delicious omelets and offered to take a photo of us at our table. Every day after she greeted us by name with a huge smile. On our last day we asked if she would take our photo again and she went above and beyond offering to walk toward the water with us and making suggestions for how to pose. They were the best photos of us on the trip. We can not thank her enough. Our favorite dinner was at Finesse where we chose to do the set menu with wine pairings. Although it was expensive it was one of the most delicious meals we \u2019ve had. The Dessert Opera is a must try. My husband and I got PADI certified to dive prior to coming on the trip and were excited to do some diving. Unfortunately the first morning we woke up my husband was sick with congestion and swollen tonsils. Majid sent the doctor right away. He was very friendly and helpful in getting my husband and antibiotic and other medicine. Majid was able to reschedule our dives without a problem. The dive center is outstanding. The equipment is well maintained and clean. The staff are friendly knowledgable and you can tell they have a passion for what they do. Special thanks to Vivian for taking us out on a private dive we felt in such good hands. She also took the time to tell us about some fish we might see before and and gave us hand signals so we would know. Also special thanks to Juhe who took my husband on his orientation dive and helped us schedule our private trip. Overall from beginning to end the service property amenities and food were wonderful.

I think next time we stay in any hotel I would go for a full board meal plan instead of half board our meal plan because for the meals that were not covered I ordered daily from the in villa dining menu for my son and if I was hungry I would order a salad or something. which on average costs about 4050 for the total order.

SumaryThe JV is superb. Staff are excellent scenery is pristine and there are plenty of island activities to keep you occupied if you \u2019re not set on relaxing. If you \u2019re deliberating you would n\u2019t be disappointed if you opted to stay here. Ok if you have more time I was n\u2019t ready for the warm welcome arriving on the island and when the time came I was equally unready to depart. My wife and I decided that as we were committing to the Maldives we would pay a bit more for a better experience that did n\u2019t involve taking a third plane ride. We did our research and settled on JV. It did n\u2019t disappoint. The folks who work there are almost without exception fantastic. A few individuals who we repeatedly spoke with really stand out as being lovely people and excellent professionals. Other hotels could learn a lot from these guys. I hope to be going back and look forward to seeing them again. The scene is beautiful not boring The waters are stunning. Inviting aquamarine rich blues and greens in the sea are even more evocative than the videos can portray. Choral just feet off the shore host a fascinating array of harmless fish. A highlight of snorkeling at sunset was habitually seeing a fever of small eagle rays glide by within touching distance. I was most looking forward to our ocean flat which felt surprisingly secluded and gave an unexpected feeling of removal and freedom. When we finished our stint on the sea and moved to the mainland I had to reluctantly admit that the latter situation was probably even better. The beach off the sand from our land flat was teaming with life. The set up was as ergonomic as inviting featuring a path that leads from the bedroom onto the beach. As a result you have a constant invitation to get back to the sea. It \u2019s a natural allure that I was not always able to resist. We were placed on the sunset side and after walking around the island I doubt I \u2019d trade it for the sunrise locations though most of the accommodation looked lovely regardless. When swimming The beach ocean is shallow for about 20 30 ft before a ridge that declines out of sight. For family snorkeling it \u2019s stunning. Just bring sun cream as your back will see more rays than you anticipate when embarking on a patrol of the choral. For dining there are four main arenas that should be enough for most people. We dabbled with the French establishment once but the food was not any better than the main option either by quality or preparation. While it does make for a change. the main joint alternates enough each day so we did n\u2019t see the need to look elsewhere again. My review of Trip Advisor suggested that the main complaints with JV were that if you buy anything above and beyond the package you initially make you \u2019l pay through the nose for it. A smoke coke or ice cream an expedition or massage commodity or service if it \u2019s an extra it \u2019s going to cost you. a lot. I understood that so was n\u2019t disappointed when it proved to be spot on. Compare that to complaints of other nearby destinations that range from inferior beaches to unhelpful staff and while it is literally a high price to pay it \u2019s a predictable concern that is totally under your control. The fundamentals of the holiday experience at JV are not really debated. There may be equally picturesque places further afield in the Maldives but our experience did n\u2019t disappoint at all.

We had great butlers Michele and Salman who are always available via quick phone dial button or whatsap. The staff at the kidsclub are very nice with kids and the staff at the restaurants are helpful and professional. I need to highlight this point because we had a bit of a fight with them over a miscomunication will share in the next section. They were thoroughly calm and professional throughout5. the kids loved the buggies. The island is pretty big so travelling with buggy is necessary but also a fun activity for the kids6. the kid club was great. My 2 sons enjoyed it everyday. We spent a lot of time there due to bad weather but they did not get bored from it7. the food was very good. 4 restaurants to satisfy the need for variety. We particularly loved the Finese french restaurant for the beautiful settings. The grill bar at the main buffet restaurant was amazing too. Breakfast is not bad at al8. the fitness was good. I tried it as well. 9 the submarine was amazing for our kids. We saw some sharks and turtles10. the bar looks stunning. We did not get to sit there for the evening coz we have kids but it would have been amazingOveral we had great time despite the constant rain for 80 of our time. We loved it and the kids loved it. Will definitely recommend it to our friendsdid not try the spa. No comment there. Things that could be beter1. it rained almosy everyday. But we can not blame the resort 2 miscomunication happened on the first day. Our butler told us that our halfboard package covers 95 person at the non buffet restaurant but later we found out that only for adults and the kids only enjoy complementary kids meal. So there were some 100 charge on our bill on top of the 95x2 that is covered by the HB package. We argued with the restaurant staff on this as this is clearly miscomunication on their side. They were professional throughout. At the end they escalated to the management who eventually did not charge us for that. 3. again miscomunication on the charge of the submarine. We were told on the phone by the diving center that they would not charge our kids 6 and 2 for the submarine only the adults. When we arrived they told us that my 6yo kid would only enjoy 50 adult fair. While the charge is fair we have been told otherwise before so we were not happy about that. Eventually they did not charge for the kid4. there are 10 buggies in the resort so at crunch time there are not enough and guests need to wait for very long time for one to arrive 30. We are on holiday so generally we are in no hurry but the kids can be hungry and sleepy or sometimes we wait under the rain so it will not be nice to wait for too long5. other services may not arrive quickly as well. We needed to call twice some times to remind them. Say on one occasion that the toilet chokes. I would still grade our experience 5 despite all of the above. I thought it was an amazing and memorable experience.", "offset": [2744, 2830], "date": "2019-12-02", "cpt": "1", "category": "price"}, {"id": 19, "uid": "12a0927b-833b-4e88-98b0-70542f28483a", "sentence": "Amazing vacation. The hotel is beautiful and we had lovely experience. The location is very near from the hotel by speed boat. The staff are friendly and the service was excellent specially the housekeeping service. The assigned person to take care of our need was always available. The main dining restaurant had different them daily and the quality of food was delicious and excellent. The room was very clean comfortable and big in size. You can do many things in the island with cheaper price comparing to other hotel in Maldives. The only negative thing was faced was the cold pool water that we could not swim due to big size of the pool that even when it is sunny the water does n\u2019t come warm. Overall amazing beautiful place full of memories.", "offset": [441, 534], "date": "2019-12-06", "cpt": "1", "category": "price"}]}
