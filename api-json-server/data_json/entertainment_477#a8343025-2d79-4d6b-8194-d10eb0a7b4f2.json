We have enjoyed several cruises over the years but now find that all inclusive resorts are more our style. We have done Cancun and Riviera Maya so thought we had give Nassau a return visit. She shopped around and we decided that we wanted to get the most value for our money and Melia seemed to fit the bill. We booked 5 nights between Xmas and New Years all inclusive for about 215 per person per day. Choose the Island View King and started counting down the days. With a month or so to go I started reading reviews again and grew worried that we had made a mistake. I am pleased to say those fears were unnecessary but did help to lower my expectations before arrival. Cab from the airport was 20 and I prefer that to a shuttle that stops numerous places. We arrived at noon and check in was less than 20 minutes as there were a few groups ahead of us. I had read about a 40 resort fee but again that fear was unfounded as they did take a card for incidentals but upon checkout we had no extra charges at all. Our room was ready and we got the king we requested and a nice view of the ocean from 617 as well. It was a short walk to the elevators but nothing I had call too far. A quick change and down to the buffet for lunch which was really nice. Lots of options and presented nicely. Later in the week we also ate from the grills by the pool and had a good burger chicken sandwich and Caesar Salad as well. Even by 130pm we were able to find chairs on the beach and I must say they were the nicest beach lounge chairs I have come across. Dinner our first night was the Italian restaurant where the food and service were excellent. We dined hear a second night as well and enjoyed things just as much. The Veal Oso Buco was fantastic. Also ate at Cilantro and Nikei and had wonderful food and service at these restaurants as well. We thought each menu was unique with many great options. My wife prefers fish seafood and I am a red meat guy. The steaks I had were really good and my wife was impressed with the different seafood options. We also felt the Sushi rolls were some of the best we ever had. Breakfast each morning was at the buffet and the selections were wide and varied The fresh fruits was very good with kiwi and star fruit nice treats along with the standard melon and pineapple options. Only nitpick was that some of the hot dishes were not as warm as they should have been. I can imagine that if you were not all inclusive the food and drinks could have added up fast. I know from just one day of keeping a running tab we easily could have incurred a several hundred dollar food drink tab. Once again I suggest just paying upfront and then not worrying about it. As for the drinks the Sands and Kalik beer were very good. Sands is tastes like Becks and the Kalik is like Heineken. The house wine was Chilean and the wife thought the reds were very good. Liquor was all top shelf as I enjoyed my Wild Turkey and Coke and the wife here White Russians with Absolute and Kahlua. Also had Captain Morgan and Myers Dark Rums as well and Bombay Gin. No well crap unles you asked for a Long Island. We secured a prime beach spot with small table and umbrella each morning but you had to be out early to do so. We are early risers so this was never and issue for us. There were servers walking the beach but we found it easier to walk over to the bar. Had great service but they ran out of beer one day. How do you run out of BEER. As for the service it was good very good overall and most of the employees we encountered were very friendly. We did however encounter many rude guests most of them European. If you really think talking loudly and stepping in front of others is your right then please stay over on your side of the ocean. Our room was made up every afternoon when we returned from the beach at 430 but we could see they had just recently finished so do not expect fresh towels and sheets by noon. Room was nice and clean and the bed was comfortable. For us we only use the room as a place to sleep so paying for a better view or larger suite is silly. If I was to rate the entire stay by the room size I had say it was a little small. The resort itself is undergoing renovations but the only area that was closed was the outside O Grill area. The construction I read so much about was not noticeable or bothersome. The lobby and common areas are very nice and modern They keep things very clean in my opinion. The pool and ocean temps were refreshing but acceptable. The whirlpools were not heated but also not hot tubs. If you are willing to sit in a resort hot tub or swim in the same pool with a swim up bar and lots of little kids then you deserve whatever ick you come home with. The other two pools were beautiful. There was entertainment each evening in the lobby that varied from a boys choir to a DJ at the Tapas Lounge. There were activities at the beach and pool everyday and on New years Eve they had a couple of bands and some shows. The nightlife was far from crazy spring break but that is not what we were looking for. We did wander over to the casino next door. It is not part of the Melia but connected to the closed hotel next door. It seems to be housing for all the workers at the Baha Mar that is being constructed. You would see them at the Starbucks in the lobby in the morning. The casino is hardly Vegas but if you enjoy playing slots or video poker it is on par with most Indian Casinos I have visited. Nothing special but since it is within walking distance all indoors it is worth a visit. Overall I had say this was a great value with great food and drinks friendly staff and a nice visit. If you want 5 stars then go pay for it. If you are willing to accept that for the money this place excels than book a stay and enjoy yourself.", "offset": [5080, 5167], "date": "2015-01-02", "cpt": "0", "category": "entertainment"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "c4c4843f-fdc0-4fb6-b8ef-a5b63dda6dd4", "sentence": "Quick Getaway. The hotel is close to the airport but away from Nassau. There are buses that run to Nassau during the day but if you miss the last one back you are out of luck and have to take an expensive taxi. Food is relatively pricey everywhere in the Bahamas but there was a nice Thai restaurant next door to the hotel which had decent priced delicious food. There is also a grocery store about a mile away but the hotel does not have fridges or microwave ovens so you can not get much of a meal together. Check out the little shops under the hotel in the tunnel leading to the casino for snacks and drinks. The beach and pool areas are awesome. They were still building the mega hotel next door so Melia was relatively quiet and relaxing.

I just arrived home from The Melia. I traveled with my husband and 2 other couples. We stayed from March 29th to April 3rd. Our first night was a Sunday and maybe because it was a weekend there was a 1 man entertainer. No complaints on him he was great. What this resort needs is night entertainment every night. Everyone is on vacation here on every night of the week. The lobby area where there is the Tapas lounge is very pretty nicely done but it is so boring at night. Who wants to have to pay to travel elsewhere when you have paid all inclusively. On our last night there we bit the bullet and traveled to Senior Frogs downtown. Ah what a relief to hear music and have the feeling of fun and atmosphere. The other thing that we hoped for was a casino. We hear there will eventually be a casino. We did not hear good things about the Atlantis casino not including free drinks when you are gambling so we opted not to visit there. The food overall was very good and plenty to choose from at the buffet. There are other restaurants aside from the buffet but were impossible to get a reservation for in spite of trying first thing in the morning. We did manage to eat at The Aqua which was very good food and the service was great. We ended up always eating at the buffet but while there were staple foods each time there was always something else different each night. If you like a full fledge salad bar like myself you will be very pleased. While we prefer an adult only resort The Melia does offer a kids area but most of the couples with kids brought their kids to the swim up bar pool. We would have preferred the kids to not be allowed to use this particular area. Overall we would return to The Melia but not until they have a casino and we hear they have added evening entertainment. If you do not care about any of those 2 things you would be satisfied with visiting The Melia.", "offset": [774, 821], "date": "2015-04-04", "cpt": "0", "category": "entertainment"}, {"id": 3, "uid": "fdc81edb-6cfa-473b-a5e3-c77d106c4c53", "sentence": "High end just lacking nightlife.

My most favorite part of the only was the fresh smell. so good they should bottle it and sell it. The one downside was the lack of nightlife.

We were at Melia Nassau in April 2015 for my sisters wedding with our 2 kids ages 4 and 7. Some good things about Melia some passable and some deplorable not all mentioned hereOVERAL there are likely better Caribbean kid friendly places to stay for the money especially with younger kids. Bahamas is expensive Canadian dollar also hurts. do not know what other Bahamian non inclusive hotel price comparable would be. We enjoyed food 8 out of 10 compared to other Caribbean all inclusives Cuba Dominican Republic Cancun. Weather in mid April was 95 sunny 2 short rain downpours and hot. As for staying there with kids you have to make your own fun. We never took our kids to the kids club as the programs were virtually non existent. So if your hoping for some adult only time while imagining your kids frolicking with Melia Kids Co staff then this is not the place for you. Kids could sit in the small clubhouse and watch tv sometimes a movie. Really this is the best they can do. There is an outdoor ping pong table and sometimes beach bocci. I never once saw a kids coordinator followed lovingly like the pied piper by throngs of kids as I have heard of in other resorts such as in Puerto Valarta. If your kids love building sand castles for hours decent beach though lacking in shade and swimming pools are pretty good look better in the pictures. FYI. One of the pools on west side is a favourite place for birds to bathe in every day which the hotel does not have much control of but did not sit well with most of us. The included water sports are fun and older kids might have more fun with the pedal bikes and kayaks 30 min rentals at a time. Sign up is a bit cumbersome and needs improving bring own snorkel gear if kids want to snorkel daily to avoid the sign up hassles. Limited snorkeling not wow at hotel beach. However Stuarts Cove snorkeling excursions off property. worth it. and they provide good snorkel gear for your excursionBathroms are far from beach. Polsides bathroom is busy they do their best to keep clean not easy. Alternatively on beach level the indoor bathroom Aqua Marketplace was out of service the entire week. Leaving only main floor bathroom a trek as only other public washroom outside of your own room. Restaurants are ok not wow for kids. Marketplace buffet usually had something kids would eat. Nikei was our favourite luckily one of my kids loves sushi and staff were willing to special order the preferred kind for us. If you have a large party 8 10 people. then the private dining room in Nikei is nice and great if there are young restless kids who need to move around without disturbing other diners. During our stay we ate in the private dining room twice given we could chose from our 36 wedding party goers to make up a large dinner party. Hibachi in Nikei also fun. Aqua was good for kids with limited palates pizza pasta fries chicken fingers. We found eating inside at Aqua better ambiance as the decent lounge singer provided some mood music outside does not have same ambiance. Cilantro was passable for kids. Not many restaurants anywhere it seems have kid sized glasses to drink from for little hands to hold non tippy. If you have the money for adjoining rooms or upgrades then that gives you somewhere to sit at night if you have little ones that go to bed early. The price prohibitive for us. Kids and Co rooms did not seem worth it silly upgrade pricing all for some snacks as there is no separate sitting area the same size as standard rooms. Upon arrival we upgraded to ocean view. 30USD day vs the quoted 45 READ negotiable. Glad we did made stay nice room 585 I think. I advise 5th floor or higher for a good view and nearer to the stairs for access. It was easy to get to from beach without having to take elevator EVERY TIME and walk down long hallways. That being said we like taking the stairs even carting water toys and paraphernalia with us. Bring life jackets if your kids need. One special note be warned that lobby bar staff are rude if you approach bar when kids are with you. They will not serve you and gruff about it. I had two 4year old flower girls with me and tried to pre order tequila shots for bride bridesmaids minutes before they arrived while I hustled the flower girls to bathroom every mom does this when there is a critical event about to take place. And Every Bride needs a moment to compose themselves before walking down aisle. Note air conditioner in Brides room was not working and everyone was melting getting dressed makeup hair not fun. The bartender shooed me away. Luckily help arrived and was able to place the order while I scuttled flower girls to the bathroom to be back in time for the bridal party arrival and procession. What other option did I have. I ordered sodas for the flower girls who had to drink them 15 feet away from wedding party. There needs to be signage at lobby bar stating they will not serve you at the bar if kids are standing with you what is a solo parent to do. Oddly enough polside bar staff will serve you no problem with kids and sometimes even by the same servers as were inside. All I ask is they be pleasant about it versus cold and dismissive. This happened on a number of occasions parents picking up drinks enroute to beachFamily or cultural entertainment is virtually non existent. So do not expect shows. Lounge singer was the best it got he was good albeit with same repertoire every night. Some daily polside games more geared to adults. Kids loved the cats on property but that is not everyones cup of tea. FYI. We brought booster seats and did not use for off property excursions as we mostly went on tour buses or boosters were not needed in taxis. So do not bother bringing unles your conscious tells you otherwise. Check in check out not efficient. Beds were not super comfy. I remember in 205 the Grand Lucayan hotel Freport beds being comfy. What was really memorable was the departing guests passing on water toys noodles floating inner tubes etc for our kids to use and pass along to the next families. Great karma.

My family and I just returned yesterday from a week stay at this hotel. We were a group of six I travelled with my sister and we are both in our 20s my brother and his friend who are 18 and our parents. We are all inclusive addicts and this was our first visit to Bahamas. Overall we had a wonderful time but we all agreed there could be room for improvement as this hotel has LOTS of potentialRom. We booked 3 separate rooms with The Level as we heard the rooms were nicer I am not sure if this is true but we had no complaints. it was clean and spacious and the room service and mini bar service was consistent. We were on the 9th floor and had a breathtaking view of the pool area and ocean. The Level also got us our own lounge which had computers premium alcohol both in the lounge and at each bar and small snacks throughout the day. It also gets you a private section on the beach and they make your dinner reservations for you at the a la cartes. Be sure to go to the 3rd floor for check in I read reviews before going we were able to have a quick check in with the great level staff since we immediately knew where to go upon arrival once we found the elevators. Pool Grounds The grounds are nice but the pools could use some tlc as could the general walkaways to the pool. A lot of the times the pools were dirty and you could see that the paint was peeling on the inside and there was rust on the pool ledge. But when you have such a stunning beach this should be nothing to complain about. There is a main pool with music and two quieter pools which are great for kids. They also have lifeguards on duty and they are wonderful. My dad was stung by a jelly fish on the beach and when he asked them what he could have been stung by they provided lots of information and cotton balls dipped in vinegar to relieve the sting. If you are at the pool and want snacks there are two options a covered area with burgers hotdogs and salads or a station set up by a woman who grills sandwiches and quesadillas. There is an outdoor snack bar currently under construction. Beach. This was the most beautiful beach I have ever been to. The water is so clear and clean which is why we chose Bahamas as a lot of other destinations are having issues with seaweed. The water colour is indescribable you have to see it to believe it. As you swim you can see tiny fish and even turtles may pop up once in a while. They also offer non motorized activities such as bicycles in the water canoes with glass floors etc. Note to people who enjoy walking the beach you can only walk towards the right of the hotel and you will find new hotels that are not yet open. We heard that the builder created these hotels but ran out of money before they were fully completed and now there are issues with the government over who is going to take over these hotels. Take a walk past those and you will find a beautiful dock and it feels like you are on a private beach. Pass that and you will find the Breezes hotel which is the only other open hotel on the strip at this time. If you are choosing between Melia and Breezes choose Melia we heard negative reviews about Breezes and is it not renovated and modern like this hotel. Food For an all inclusive the food was delicious. We found the Asian to be the best but be sure to ask for the tepanyaki. We did not know we had to specify and ended up at a table with menus but it was still great. What we found a bit odd was that when people were sat on the other side of the restaurant at the tables where they cook in front of you they would close these sliding doors as if they did not want people to know that that part of the restaurant was available for booking we could not think of any other explanation. We also tried Cilantro the Mexican restaurant and Aqua which is the Italian we all found the meals to be great although lots of guests said the Italian was their least favourite. The buffet does not have too much variety but for what they offer I can not complain breakfast was the best. They also have light night food at Tapas lounge. when we arrived the staff said it was their first time trying out a late night menu of burgers and sandwiches from 11 pm to 3 am. The food was good but when the bar closed at unpredictable hours certainly way before 3 am there was nobody there to work or make the food. Service Definitely a hit and miss. Although most of the workers are very friendly and kind there is a lot of inconsistency with the level of service you receive. A few examples include waiting over ten minutes for drinks at the bars minus the bar next to the Level the bar tender was the best. and being served after people who came after us on multiple occasions standing at the pool bar and a worker starring into the distance and we would wave for drinks but it took him five minutes if not more to even acknowledge us and this happened twice waiting over an hour for our food at the Asian restaurant getting served coffee after we finished our breakfast meal or one day not being served at all during breakfast. Myself my sister and a lady we met all agreed that at the bars men were getting served before women. A person who overhead our conversation said he agreed and that it was a Caribbean thing where male bar tenders will serve men first out of respect. The Level section was great but they made reservations for us which was relieving but each reservation came with issues. For the Mexican we got a call at 530 saying the reservation was changed from 7 pm to 6 pm luckily we were already ready. For the Asian we showed up and were told it was for tomorrow. The Level staff confirmed we had it right but the restaurant refused to take us even when the level staff questioned them about it. And for the Italian we were told we had reservations for 4 instead of 6 and the woman wanted to refuse us because they were fully booked. With my mothers complaints we ended up getting seated and realized only half the restaurant was full for the entire meal so this was all a bit frustrating. Be sure to check in with the restaurants to confirm your reservations ahead of time the Level staff told us that their system versus the restaurant systems are different. We also found that at the buffet the hostesses and their system for seating people was quite disorganized. For example one woman sits at the front asks for how many people if you want inside or outside and then tells you to wait for the hostess. At least two more women would ask us the exact same questions after that before we got seated. This is really just nit picking but their system should be more organized to avoid confusion and repetitive questions. Entertainment I would give this hotel a 5 star if it was not for inconsistent service and lack of night life. I did see water aerobics once and soca exercise four times but besides that there is nothing happening during the day regardless of what the schedule says which is something we all love to participate in and were very disappointed by. The evenings were quiet besides either live music or nights where the dj played 70s music and salsa. What we also found strange last call at the Tapas bar was different we got told last call at 1220 1245 and 10. There is no disco on site and the casino is also closed. This goes back to the hotels being built beside the Melia apparently the casino either went bankrupt or people were not paying the rent for it. Now it is their goal to open up the largest casino on the strip but it is at a halt because of the issues with money and the opening of the other hotels as they will all be sharing the new casino once everything gets resolved. If you go down the escalator you will see where the casino is supposed to be there is also an ice cream shop cigar shop and liquor store in that hallway. Your best bet if you are looking for nightlife is to go with a fun group of people meet new people and drink the night away or go into town. There is also free wifi across the hotel if you are bored. All in all we loved the Bahamas including a day trip to Atlantis which we highly recommend but please be careful in the straw market which is something you have to pass to get to the boat that takes you to Atlantis. We had a woman put bracelets on us and when my dad asked how much they were first the ladies said it was free. Once the bracelets were on they asked for a donation so my dad offered 5. The girls said no this is too little and my dad mentioned that they originally said it was free and he was kind enough to offer 5 and they said no and demanded more money so we took off the bracelets and my father took the money back from the lady. Although the market may have good deals I do not recommend shopping there. In final we all agree we would return to this property strictly for it is incredible beach and for the inside appearance of the hotel and the quality of food. We heard phase 2 of renovations will commence shortly and I believe after that this place will be a gem but of course that is if they improve on the level of services provided by employees. Again some workers are wonderful but there seems to be a lot of miscomunication between staff and I think it has something to do with all the Bahama Drama occurring on the strip. Either way have fun be safe enjoy and make wonderful memories after all you are in the beautiful Bahamas.", "offset": [7471, 7697], "date": "2015-08-24", "cpt": "0", "category": "entertainment"}, {"id": 6, "uid": "acd5c9e9-f173-4f08-ac23-9555d61a48d2", "sentence": "Beautiful escape to paradise. Firstly I must add that my impression of our stay was impacted by the period of travel. We had gone as 2 couples during the 1st week of December and I believe as it was after US Thanksgiving and before Christmas it was a rather low period for travel thus the resort was nowhere near booked to capacity. This meant NO lines for food or issues booking restaurant dinners. We managed to get our rooms early so that helped in changing out of warmer clothes and then exploring the resort. Our first day there we had lunch at the grill it was good bq chicken sandwiches hamburgers hotdogs with sides of salad. and the view was outstanding. There is free wifi in both the rooms and throughout the resort so we were able to check daily what the weather was expected to be or stream Netflix for those evenings in. There are activities you can do on the beach sign out paddle boards the oversized water bikes seados etc. There is a beach ball volleyball net up but we did not see anyone playing nor was there anyone at the basketball hoop up either. Unlike other resorts we have been to we did not find any outdoor events taking place no loud music at the outdoor bar no games or water aerobics and such. There were some events happening in the evenings near the hotel lobby inside dance performances etc. It was VERY low key which worked for us but if you are into that you may find it boring. This time of year there were only a handful of kids seen which we liked as well. Our room was on the 8th floor just steps away from the elevator. Ask for a similar placement if possible so you are not walking a long stretch to the outside rooms I have heard a few older folks complaining about the long distance walk. When you check in book all your dinners right away to ensure you get the restaurants you want for your specific evenings. The buffet is available every evening and was not full at all. Food items varied slightly by night and was clean and replenished. Water is safe to drink as well staff was very friendly. I understood that this resort used to be a Sheraton a few years back but it is since changed over and they seem to still be doing some maintenance on the property so you may hear the work done while you are in your room early morning or if by the pools not overly obtrusive. There used to be a casino on the property at that time too but it is since closed down. We had taken a cab over 30 USD one day for the 4 of us to Atlantis for a few hours to check out the casino and shops. The cost for a day pass at the waterpark was too much in our opinions so we passed on that. We did take the local bus to the downtown for shopping. it is 125 USD one day and very convenient comes every 5 10mins or so and picked us up and dropped us off out front of our resort. There are many high end shops and also the straw market to explore highly recommend an afternoon shopping. If the conditions were the same low capacity booking I would DEFINITELY return to this resort and recommend it. The beach was beautiful and it is about a 20mins drive from the airport very close and has a Starbucks on the resort as well.", "offset": [2404, 2521], "date": "2015-12-31", "cpt": "0", "category": "entertainment"}, {"id": 7, "uid": "6f7b4df4-cea1-41b9-9e13-46ca5b3225ea", "sentence": "There are Pros and Cons to this place.

The first night we did not arrive at hotel until 830 so by the time we went to dinner it was about 930 and we did not have no problem walking in to Italian restaurant because it was late. They do not take reservations at this rest. So if you go between 60 and 80 good luck trying to get in they should do reservations for this rest. We visited the Atlantis two nights and ate there.

I will be ranking each experience on a scale of 1 star to 5 stars with 5 stars being the highest mark. My wife and I are 31 and 29 years of age to put things in perspective. We booked through Costco travel. CHECK IN 1 StarCame as a party of 5. Married couple with our 9month old daughter and my wifes parents who d be assisting in child care. My in laws booked The Level and my wife and I did the normal. I had read reviews that people who booked The Level had no issues getting their room right away and were given a higher level of service. This was not the case with my in laws situation. It took several hours to get them a room and then it was missing key additions for our daughter that were paid for and discussed multiple times in advance crib and a fridge with a freezer for her milk. Eventually this situation was resolved but not nearly as speedy or competently as you had hope for especially since my in laws tipped the representative spearheading their check in process. My wife and I were prepared for a long wait for OUR room and that was true to expectations. we waited 3 4 hours. But additionally they dropped the ball on our room and we did not have accommodations we paid for an ocean view and a king size bed instead a cement wall view and 2 double beds. Three different visits to the front desk. a day passed and 2 rooms later we finally obtained a room that matched what we paid for. ROMS 3 StarsOf the three rooms we experienced all were pretty much identical. The decor is nothing fancy but it is not ridiculously outdated either. it is simple relatively modern and does the job. Heres the breakdown. A table and arm chair 2 night stands with lamps on them full length mirror closet safe tv on a larger dresser w drawers and a mini fridge with a few beverages and chips. Clean and simple bathroom as well. Never really had a problem with the water temperature. While it was not too hot it was not cold either. Your balcony size will differ depending on what side of the hotel you are on. If you have a legitimate ocean room the view is fantastic. POOLS 4 Stars3 pools all outdorsMain pool w a swim up bar warmer water. it is also connected to the main bar that services the outdoor area 2 side pools with a mini waterfall and grotto type setup colder waterThe side pools have hot tubs near them as well. All three were nice and well maintained. The main pool was the busiest with servers walking around for drink requests. There is an entertainment crew that conducts different events at the main pool on certain days and times. BEACH 4 StarsBeautiful water. Tends to be pretty windy. Lots of chairs on the sand. some with palapas. While the property is big they do squeeze as many seats onto the beach as possible so you will have many people around you. FODAqua Italian 4 StarsMy wife and I thought this was the best of the three restaurants we had reservations at. Servings sizes were sufficient and the food was very good. Nikei Asian Habachi 4 StarsWe ate here with the entire family and sat at the Hibachi table. While the servers and chef were entertaining the chef does not put on a show with tricks as is typical at most Hibachi restaurants. That was a little disappointing considering we brought our 9month old thinking there had be theatrics for her to marvel at. Nonetheless the food was also very good main entree choices are seafood chicken or befCilantro Mexican. 4 StarsBe forewarned that this restaurant takes the longest to serve your meals. My wife and I were probably there for nearly 2 hrs and we are not the lollygaging type. Also the portions are very small other than the quesadillas so you will need to get multiple orders of the dishes. Still though the food was very good here too especially the steak tacosThe Market Place Buffet. 3 StarsWe pretty much ate most of our breakfast and lunch meals here. I have to say the food was much better than I was expecting for a buffet. Seemed pretty fresh for the most part and with many options we never had an issue finding something we could eat each time. We were pleasantly surprised. LOBBY BAR 4 StarsThe four stars is more for the entertainment they have here nightly. The DJs singers bands and dancers who performed throughout the week were quite talented. They definitely got the party rocking and everyone present enjoyed dancing and singing. It becomes a lively atmosphere. The drawback is that because it gets so crowded it becomes extremely difficult to get drinks at the bar. So unles you are waving around money and even then it may not work. good luck. STAFF 4 StarsGeneraly speaking we found that nearly all the workers were very friendly and willing to help. We never had issues with attitudes or being unfairly treated. ORGANIZATION. 2 StarsThis is where the Melia suffers. From overboking terrible check in process and mismanaging rooms to not following through with listed events running out of essential bar ingredients and other hospitality related issues. they are not a well oiled machine. So depending on your expectations you will be content or disappointed. OVERALL 32 StarsConsidering that the resort is all inclusive it is a good value in comparison to a place like Atlantis. While I have never stayed at Atlantis my wife and I did price it out and it is quite expensive just to stay on the property let alone upgrade to their all inclusive package. I honestly can not see it being SO much better that it justifies the huge jump in price. Melia is a great property with something for everyone. I will say it seems to be more on the family side regarding the breakdown of its guests but there are an assortment of travelers present. Between the beach pools boos food and entertainment I had say it is worth it. IF they could tighten up their organization on the aspects I detailed above it had be four stars in my book. TIPS. Like many resorts if you want a chair on the beach or polside better get downstairs early and put your towels items down to reserve them. They go QUICKLY. The bus into town is just 125 utilize it during the day rather than taking a cab if you are going off the resort. Bring lots of singles to tip for drinks at any of the bars or by the pool. Free Wi Fi and we used it a ton.", "offset": [5686, 5763], "date": "2016-04-24", "cpt": "0", "category": "entertainment"}, {"id": 9, "uid": "89edd3ca-d9b6-4977-bca9-19fbdda8872a", "sentence": "Huge Disappointment. We booked our trip through Costco Travel. We arrived at 1030pm on March 26 2016 and our room was not ready yet. We had to wait over an hour before we were given keys. We were very hungry as well so they directed us to the Tapas place right in the lobby. There was a very loud DJ playing and hundreds of college students at the lobby bar which was fine it was late on a Saturday but we were to soon find out this was to be the norm everywhere. The hostess sat us down but no one came over for 15 minutes. One waitress came to our table and removed our menus saying this menu was over. Then she took away our table lamp. Another waitress came and gave us a piece of paper with 4 things listed apparently their late night menu. We ended up getting two cold cut sandwiches served in styrofoam boxes. Seriously. Definitely not a great first impression of the restaurant scene nor very good service. At least the lobby bartender was friendly. When we got to the room it had a king size bed there were three of us. When we called the front desk they said a roll away would be 25 night. My husband explained that we were traveling with our 10 year old son and had booked one room with 3 people. They did not charge us for the roll away but by this time it was well after midnight and we were beginning to question our decision to be here. We soon found out that Melia was overrun with college spring breakers. Around 3 am in the morning a loud bunch of drunk boys came barreling down the hall slamming doors and shouting. This happened EVERY night between 2 am 4 am. Melia needs to do something about their soundproofing their hallways and rooms. So apparently a travel company Student City gave the University of Delaware students a cheap trip to Melia the week we were there. This created a chaotic party atmosphere. Not family friendly at all. Even the staff was stressed out from their visit. These students were rude to the staff I witnessed one group of girls snapping their fingers at the waitress we need water. and another group yelling at their waitress. They were extremely discourteous to other guests as well. One evening while my son and I sat by the pool an intoxicated student in the hot tub was cursing and talking loudly about how he smuggled cocaine in and then when he realized my 10 year old could hear him he said to his friend I would never bring my child here. He was right. I should never have brought my family to Melia. This group of Delaware students ruined our vacation. They left giant messes wherever they went cut in line at the overcrowded bars and kept us awake all night. When they finally left about 5 days into our trip the resort calmed down and I could see what a nice place Melia COULD be. Like my husband said it is a 5 star location with 1 star service. I do not blame the staff as much as I blame the management. One positive my son loved the kids club. However we will never visit Melia again.", "offset": [275, 463], "date": "2016-04-25", "cpt": "0", "category": "entertainment"}, {"id": 10, "uid": "82c6559d-c058-4192-8a73-daf0afce8c29", "sentence": "Picturesque beach hotel but service needs improvement. I stayed at Melia Nassau Beach for a week at the end of May I am glad I read some of the reviews beforehand as what to expect. I used to think that vacationers writing negative reviews were too harsh on the hotel. I would say for the most part the reviews are pretty accurate as far as there being lots of positives and negatives. My boyfriend and I booked the hotel as level guests thanks to reading the reviews ahead of time. We arrived and checked in at the hotel late in the evening the level check in was closed so we ended up checking in at the main lobby which was fine. They gave us red bracelets and said go to the level check. in the morning to switch to the gold bracelet. After settling in we went to the lobby lounge area called Estavida where they had music people dancing and a bar. I sat at the bar for maybe 15 minutes without anyone asking if I had been helped or if I wanted a drink. The staff were slightly busy but they could have acknowledged us by \u201c I will be right with you \u201d. Finally after getting someone \u2019s attention they gave us our drinks but when we asked to use the high shelf liquor they said it was for level guests. My boyfriend explained to them that we were but we checked in late and the level lounge was closed so we have to go tomorrow to get the gold bracelet. They said we needed some sort note letter from the front desk staff. My boyfriend left and returned with the note. Staff finally gave us the drink we wanted. It was a little disappointing that we the guests had to do the running around when a simple phone call between the staff could have sufficed. Total time to get a drink we wanted was around 45 minutes. We ordered a burger and some fries at Estavida as well and that was disappointing. I would have to say that fast food places look more appetizing. I agree with other reviews saying that if you \u2019re not a level guest they do n\u2019t care because I definitely felt that wearing the red bracelet the one night I had it. For dinner we ate at Cilantro which is a Mexican restaurant and the food was mediocre. I felt most of their meals do n\u2019t really include meat. I basically had vegetarian enchiladas and still felt hungry afterwards. We also ate at Nikei which is Japanese and it was better than Cilantro but still ok. We went to O\u2019grile for breakfast a few times and the food was ok there as well although the location of it was beautiful. It is right on the beach so you can feel the morning breeze and see the beautiful turquoise water while eating. We also ordered room service and it came in good time. The number 10 bus to go downtown is right across the street and it takes about 15 minutes and it costs 125 which is extremely affordable as opposed to the taxi which can cost between 20 30 one way. We took the bus multiple times and felt completely safe. If you want to get GOOD food I highly suggest going to the fish fry it \u2019s the equivalent of a shopping center full of restaurants in the United States and trying the restaurant Twin Brothers or Andros for excellent Bahamian food. The hotel grounds look tropical and well taken care of. I would have to say that compared to other hotels Melia Nassau definitely tries to keep the fun times going by having their guests entertained at night by playing music and having karaoke and the junkano show. They had a DJ at the pool during the day. I would definitely say this hotel is livelier than others and it can cater to young adults which I enjoyed. The elevator would go out of service constantly so we had to take the stairs multiple times. The Wi Fi would go down all throughout the day. The refrigerator had beer water and two snacks. The room was clean and we were stocked with water and towels daily. I do have to point out that Stacy is fantastic. When we called to ask about where the nearest movie theaters are she told us where we can go and provided us with movie times. When I thought Andros at Fish Fry was closed because TripAdvisor said it was she went out of her way to call the restaurant and call us back to let us know they were open. Lastly our housekeeper on the last day came into the room to have a quick talk as we were about to leave. She seemed friendly by asking what activities we did and offered advice for excursions the next time we were to come. At the end of the conversation she said if we wanted to leave a tip to leave it on the drawer where the TV was. Although we did n\u2019t have to we did leave tip but felt that things like that should not be brought up or discussed with guests. This is the second time I \u2019ve been at an all inclusive hotel but the service and food here were not notable. I would say that it did its job by providing a place to sleep giving food and having a great location next to the beach but did not feel that it was worth the money we paid. You are in the Bahamas which is close to heaven so I had a remarkable time but I would probably try another hotel next time.", "offset": [3366, 3407], "date": "2017-06-09", "cpt": "1", "category": "entertainment"}, {"id": 11, "uid": "3cc332e4-e97e-42cd-8ff9-0494ea95ebca", "sentence": "A Little Bit of Paradise.

We have complained several times about the food at the Market Place but no change there. The hotel needs a lot of attention. The rooms are clean and our room attendant is great. But the hotel needs a lot of TLC. The carpeting in the rooms and hallways needs to be changed it is old and worn. There is 1 set of elevators and yesterday afternoon it was down. Today there has been banging going on all day on the balcony of our room from morning till 5 pm. I have pictures of the men working on the outside of our balcony on the scaffold. The one positive thing is the beach which is beautiful and the non motorized paddle boats are included in your stay and some other non motorized water sports are also included. I gave them 2 stars because even though the rooms need a lot of TLC the room attendant does a great job cleaning it.

We arrived and the check in was n\u2019t too bad it was quiet and we were given a drink which was nice.

However you save a lot of money with all inclusive since almost all FB in Nassau are subject a 12 VAT and 15 gratuity.

Since I \u2019m eating for two I did n\u2019t want to worry about all the fb consumption during the trip. My husband and I opted for Level because it \u2019s our babymon. Personally I think Level is worth it for 4 reasons beach side food and drink deliveries for beach bums like us ocean view rooms beach side breakfast at O\u2019Grile as well as premium alcohol eg Belvedere vs Absolute or random no named liquors. Pros For beach worshippers the beach is steps away from your room vs other large hotels it \u2019s probably a 10 min walk to the beach welcome email prior to arrival to set up dinner reso welcome fruit plate in the room Friendly staff hit or miss but overall satisfactory Nightly turn down service Staff knocks on your door to check throughout the day to see if you need anything refilled in the rom Easy dinner reservations through Level concierge Complimentary 247 in room dining Plentiful water refills in the room Situated at the end of Cable beach so it \u2019s private and quiet. Only 1 company that walks around on the beach for solicitation for water sports Huts on the beach nearby hotels did not have this Small hotel so it \u2019s close proximity to everything. Updated fitness centre with good equipments midday workshops Eg cigar rolling henna mixology tie dye bring your own shirt. Cons Nothing we ordered ever arrived accurately whether it \u2019s missing items or different than what \u2019s described on the menu menu often sounds better than the real thing Did not supply sun screen until the last day they were backordered no decaf espresso Activities cancelled without notice Lack of lounge chairs at the adult pool No welcome drink or oshibori as advertised but not a big deal Lack of ocean rafts compared to nearby hotels. They are put out too late and collected too early If you are from North America or Asia this hotel would be considered a 3 star. My advise is do n\u2019t have high expectations and just go with the flow then you wo n\u2019t be disappointed. Beach is lovely and compound is clean. Just look the other way for old shower heads weird smell in the lobby and outdated elevators. If you are budget conscious and want a relaxing mindless vacation then Melia is right for you but if you are looking for a luxury refined vacation then Baha Mar next door will be a better choice. We also checked out Atlantis which is great for kids since there is a lot to do but the hotel is dated and requires a lot of walking since the property is big. Tips if you have dyed hair like me bring your own conditioner as the one they provide is not moisturizing enough Although tip is included still tip the outstanding staff you encounter because they appreciate it and it goes a long way Nikei has 2 dinner options regular Japanese cuisine or Hibachi. Book the Hibachi as soon as you arrive because space is limited. Book Level because the lounge chairs on the beach have pads which is so much more comfortable.

My wife and I decided to visit for Valentines Day. The airport is a very short drive to the property and upon arrival the resort appeared to be well maintained and conveniently located on the beach. The casino is at the Baha Mar Resort which is a short scenic walk along the beach. The food was good and majority of the staff were friendly. I would like to personally acknowledge Enid and Debi who are on the staff at the Marketplace Restaurant on the Resort. They were exceptional and set the example of hospitality for all to emulate. The drinks were outstanding they definitely pour the libations. We enjoyed the resort and the location. Although the resort says it is All Inclusive you have to go Melia Level to reap that benefit. Top Shelf liquor Angus Steakhouse and Chefs specials are additional for regular Melia visitors. I gave you the Good now I will give you the UGLY. On our second night my wife and I were being seated at our table in the Aqua Terrace Italian Restaurant on the resort when she slipped and fell on the wet floor. There were NO wet floor signs posted. The Restaurant Manager Colin Ferguson was present and called for the Security personnel to bring a wheelchair down. This took a significant amount of time they did give my wife a bag of ice for the immense swelling on her left knee. Michael from Security finally arrived and took my wife to our room. We thought that we would be taken to the lobby or maybe a first aid station on the resort for an initial observation but there are no emergency or first aid personnel on the property. My wife requested that she be taken to an emergency room because of the swelling and discoloration of her knee. Michael from Security requested that we write a statement before we left for the hospital. We still had 3 days left for our visit and could have completed a written statement at anytime. However we wrote the statement and Michael stated that the hospital visit could cost us up to 30. I believe that was a tactic to deter us from providing negative feedback. Upon our insistence Michael called a taxi to take us to the hospital. Our Taxi Driver was Kery and she was phenomenal. She helped us every step of the way. X rays were taken and thankfully nothing was broken or fractured. My wife did suffer a deep bruise and was required to use crutches for the remainder of our stay. As a piece of advice take the trip insurance when you book an international trip. I did not get it and the Bahamas did not take my health insurance so the hospital visit was all out of pocket expense. We spent approximately 4 hours in the hospital and upon return to the resort we were met by Michael Security and Colin Aqua Manager. My wife and I gave all pertinent documents and receipts to Michael to account for the hospital visit prescriptions and crutches. The Restaurants were closed when we returned and we had to order room service. If you stay at the Melia there is a 10 dollar delivery charge for room service Colin did waive that for my wife and I. We could only order off of the late night menu which consisted of us having fried chicken wings and salad. Our room was located on the 3rd floor and the restaurants were located on the lower level of the resort I thought that they would have tried to accommodate us and move us to a room on the lower level of the resort and that did not happen. There was only one wheelchair on the resort and we used it one day so I could take my wife downstairs for breakfast. While we were eating breakfast the Security Guard came to our seat and took the wheelchair stating that someone passed out it. I was told that I could go to Atlantis and rent a wheelchair for my wife to get around. WOW. My wife and I met a young lady named Poly who was visiting with her family from Canada. Poly asked my wife what happened and when my wife told her the story Poly told us that her husband was in the same restaurant when the door leading to the outside dining area closed on the back of his foot which caused serious lacerations. Poly said that the restaurant gave him bandages and told him to sit in the salt water at the beach to help with the healing process. After requesting to speak to a General Manager for the remainder of the trip THAT NEVER HAPPENED we finally spoke to Lakeisha a Supervisor at the front desk during our check out. Lakeisha called for Malvern the Resort General Manager. Malvern was polite and apologetic she explained the steps that would be taken regarding my wifes injury on their property which is still vague to say the least. My wife and I enjoyed the sun and atmosphere but her injury prevented us from taking complete advantage of all that the Bahamas has to offer. We were unable to do any excursions or participate in any of the activities that occurred on the resort. Also If you are a golfer the prices are ridiculous. I met a visitor from New Jersey and he was very disappointed with the golfing experience at Melia. He said that it cost him 450 to play but Expedia has golfing included. Overall Nice place but the Management Staff is only concerned with the property and not the visitors.", "offset": [221, 303], "date": "2020-02-17", "cpt": "2", "category": "entertainment"}, {"id": 24, "uid": "fa662387-d5d1-42fb-a30c-7af5c410f150", "sentence": "it is fine for a 3 4 day stay.

This was our first time to Nassau and our 2nd time to a Melia resort. The resort is a little dated in some areas but they are constantly painting and doing renovations to make the resort look good. I highly recommend the resort. All the staff friendly and accommodating especially Miriam in The Level book in. We were given a wrong room 1 with 2 beds instead of a king. She went out of her way to try and get us another room. We had to wait 2 days for it to come available and was given the option to view it first to make sure we wanted it which we did not as our view was not as good so we chose to stay in the room with the 2 double beds instead of a king bed. She compensated us with a bottle of wine right away and a bottle of champagne on our anniversary night. The beach is beautiful and the boardwalk to the other resorts and Casino were just beautiful at night. Will definitely be going back.", "offset": [793, 895], "date": "2020-03-13", "cpt": "2", "category": "entertainment"}, {"id": 28, "uid": "35766b1d-78c3-49c9-b2a1-cc39b2b088bd", "sentence": "Amazing experience with the best staff.

They sang happy birthday to my friends got them a cake and even sang a personal song to us. They really should apply to Americas Got Talent Anthony at the front desk. I had a slight emergency my friends walked off with my purse when I was in the bathroom it was that kind of night but Anthony was able to help me get one of their numbers to find out where they were and I ended up having a great night with all my stuff.
