Arrived at airport and was picked up within 10 minutes after the call to the hotel. When the ride they provide to the hotel is in a Cadilac you surmise your stay is going to be a class act. Check in was efficient and quick. The room was what one would call well appointed with no evidence of wear and tear or in need of updating. The furniture fixtures and condition was of high end. The room provided a quiet comfortable sleep and came with the usual furniture a refrigerator coffee maker safe iron and hair dryer but it did lack a microwave and mini bar. To give you an idea of how nice the furnishings were they have to have the best ice bucket I have ever encountered. Most ice buckets are made of plastic and keep the ice solid for only a few hours. This ice bucket was very nice and kept the ice frozen for twice as long as any I have used in other hotels. The room came with free wifi if you were a member of their club and I never had an issue with slow or dropped service during my stay. The housekeeping department did an excellent job. Kudos to them. Most hotels fix the bed and pick up the room and give their staff a set number of minutes to get in and out. I have to say that upon my return to the room I found it not picked up but the room was cleaned. I could not find any issue with the cleaning and always had a feeling of comfort in knowing that they took their time to do an excellent job. I worked out of the room and left when they came to clean. I found myself needing to stay away for much longer than expected because they were still working on the room. The room was not messy. I pick up after myself and keep things very neat and orderly. But the extent they went through to do a thorough daily cleaning impressed me. The hotel is situated on a large piece of land with some real estate that allows one to go for a nice walk around amongst their gardens and lawns. The outdoor pool is so unbelievably amazing. It is a rectangular pool with the hot tub and bar service off to one side. All four sides are surrounded by cabanas that have two chaise loungers a small table and fabric full length curtains on all four sides that you can close up for privacy. I found it a great area to get away from the room and to work in a different relaxing atmosphere. For those who enjoy tennis they have you covered with tennis courts. For those who enjoy or need to work out I have to admit this was by far the best hotel fitness center I have ever been to. The hotel bar had plenty of seating and was used as the go to place if you wanted an evening meal as the restaurant was only open for breakfast and lunch. The breakfast was the usual fare at a 26 buffet charge and lunch was on a limited menu. The evening menu in the bar was mostly lighter bar food fare and very limited at that. Although their prime hamburger looked good when walking by I was told by those who tried it that it did not taste good and the meat had a weird flavor. There is a well stocked gift shop with higher than normal prices for those who are desperate. They offer free rides to and from the close by airport and also to and from a strip mall across the street from Balboa village a major shopping mall and another shopping area. Although I did find the schedule of limited times requiring one to stay a minimum of three hours and needing to catch the last shuttle back to the hotel at an early time of around 7 pm otherwise the need for a cab back. They will also provide a ride to other venues within a two mile radius. One issue I had was with the valet employees who also did the shuttle service. One ride back from Balboa felt like we were in a frantic need to get back quickly zipping around corners and hitting back wrenching dips in the road. One time on one of my walks while in one of the hotels crosswalks one of them came driving around the corner so fast I had concern for getting run over. He saw me and quickly applied the brakes. Hoever I do have to commend whoever makes the decision on the number of valet employees. Too many times I see the valet service backed up causing a lot of frustration for hotel guests. This service at the Fairmont had plenty of employees and as a result was very efficient. Overall a great stay and very impressed with the hotel staff and services. Across the street McArthur Blvd are a few restaurants including a 71 further down with a few more restaurant selections. All within a 5 10 minute walk. Without close by crosswalks I none the less found it easy to cross the boulevard without being concerned for getting run over. It seemingly was built for 1000 vehicles but only has 200. It worked well to walk down a little bit and look for the cobble stoned divider between the eat west bound lanes and go halfway and wait for a short time for the traffic to clear for the next half of your crossing. Butt with all that being said I have one final issue which can best be explained by recalling those advertisements by Mastercard where they name off the price of things and use the last line of priceless. Here goes. Your ride to and from the airport in a Cadilac. Valet service30 a night. Breakfast bufet26. The toilet paper in your room the cheapest we can find. It baffles me how you can provide such high end service furnishings and amenities and then scrimp on something like toilet paper. Charge each guest an extra 25 cents a night and you would have enough to buy Charmin. I challenge managers of high end hotels to take a roll home and see how it stacks up against what you have in your home. There that ends my rant. Overall an excellent hotel and one that I would have no problem recommending or returning to.", "offset": [268, 373], "date": "2015-08-27", "cpt": "0", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 4, "uid": "20b5298b-0579-4329-b35a-507a75220e29", "sentence": "Lovely redo of the Le Meridian.

If you want a hotel stay elsewhere. There is no question that this hotel needed a facelift. When Mariot Renaissance bought it there was hope that they had put the money into it to make it a nice place to stay. It is in a convenient location but the renovation they are doing has burned through a boatload of money but unfortunately converted their rooms into modern enclaves including a bed bathroom and virtually no other useful amenities you had associate with a luxury hotel. As someone who travels for a living and usually in a location for 2 5 nights at a time I unpack. Even if I were staying only one night I will unpack most of my suitcase so I can hang my suit press my shirts have my toiletries etc. But Mariot in many of their renovations Mariot Michigan Ave in Chicago Renaissance Denver Downtown Crabtre Mariot in Raleigh to name a few. has someone who has decided that travelers do not need things like drawers or closets. Now the closet in this room is reasonable not overly spacious but better than some of those I mentioned above. But there are exactly 2 tiny drawers in the room other than the nightstand with one tiny one on each side of the bed. So if you had like to unpack you are pretty much out of luck unles you just like to pile your stuff up on the counter. Further the work surface is fixed facing a wall and in a position that will prevent you from actually watching the television while you are working. If I had the budget to buy the crap artwork they have selected and a tripod lamp that has no real functional ability other than as an accent lamp I think I had have spent it putting a dresser into the ample floor space they have wasted with just emptiness. Mariot is pushing me away from their brand. The front desk manager said it was to attract milenials who do not pack much. I guess there are a lot of milenials spending 300 a night on hotels. Whatever My suspicion is that it is actually an outcropping of the bedbug issue that hotels faced a few years ago. Some idiot at Mariot corporate decided that if the guests could not actually put their clothing in a dresser none of those little critters could get left behind. that is a valid concern but the way they have addressed it has made me despise their renovations. From now on I guess I am going to have to call the hotels and find out if they have been improved and if so start staying at the Hyat.
