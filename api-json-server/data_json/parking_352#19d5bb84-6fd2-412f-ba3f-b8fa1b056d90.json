Rooms were very clean. I booked my hotel through American Airlines and received a rate of 42 night. Hotel staff is friendly every present for questions and security concerns and hotel smells nice every time you enter. This hotel is the old Sahara hotel across from Circus Circus and it still shows signs. While most of it is updated the carpet did not match the rest of the decor. It is still the old carpet come to find out. Good selection of restaurants though the Beer Garden restaurant was a flop for us. The mojitos tasted more like juice than alcohol. The appetizer came out burnt and the food was sub par. As far as location we drove a vehicle so it was easy to go back and forth down the strip. But it is a hike to walk down to the crowded and popular parts of the strip. Though its off the monorail the monorail drops way in the back of the casinos and again a lot of extra walking just to arrive at the strip. We also encountered a negative employee on our last day in the self parking garage elevator. Said the hotel was not doing good financially and they already had to sell off one of their towers for financial reasons. Also their elevator had been broken down for 6 weeks and they just now got it fixed. I did not appreciate the negativity or the construction and round about to get to the monorail in general. For the price I paid I was fine with such inconveniences but I would not have paid the full fair for some of this. I did appreciate the added security of this hotel they have a staff member standing at hotel tower entrance and you have to show your card to enter hallway then use the room key to operate the elevator.", "offset": [650, 739], "date": "2016-02-08", "cpt": "0", "category": "parking"}, {"id": 5, "uid": "96dd9d4b-a3d7-4334-83bc-d59c57c7dc1a", "sentence": "during check in I had a large tool box that was locked with a 6 cable stolen out of the bed of my truck.

I backed in between two SUV went inside to check in. When we returned tool box and lock were gone. Security took report and saw the box in back of my truck when we entered the garage.

The pool at the fox tail lounge was okay. there is 2 pools one seems heated and the other was cold. The gaming area is small. I really thought the casino was bigger then what it was. I had like to rate higher but to many disappointments Not to mention that the mini bar was missing a item and we never touched the Damn thing.

Contacter Guest Services and they indicated I would be their top priority. An hour later I contacted Guest Services again because we still had not received any service. 20 mins after the call I received towels and a sheet. Twenty minutes after that Housekeeping arrived with a cart which I turned away because it was too late. Another 15 mins later Hpousekeping arrived with another cart. Exterior noise.

This was our second visit to SLS and our first time staying on the property. First piece of advice. hotel entrance is located on the back side east side of building. The staff was friendly and attentive. Lobby was clean and modern. Coffee shop located across from the front desk was also clean and serves excellent strong coffee. We got a complimentary upgrade to the World Tower with a Strip view. I like the fact that you need a room key to operate the elevator. The room was very clean and modern. Bed was comfortable. TV was huge actually too big for the room. It was also too bright. The bathroom was large clean and modern. We had no cold water in the bathroom when we checked in. Had to call maintenance which fixed the problem quickly. The pools The first day we went to the Lux pool which is small but nice. Mostly children in that pool which is only open Friday Sunday. The second day we went to the Foxtail pool. Very nice with comfortable pool chairs with cushions. that is a nice touch at no extra cost. Not many people at the pool but still had 2 3 servers on duty. The casino. Very nice. Clean modern and spacious. We had no luck here. Seems like no one had any luck. Machines are tight. For the most part the casino was dead most of the time. Restaurants. We did not eat here. Parking garage. Directly across from the hotel check in. Always had ample parking but smelled like urine. Bottom line Very nice hotel which I would be happy to stay at again but I am staying away from the casino. I feel that are trying to be a Wyn. but they have a long way to go to meet that standard. Unfortunately the area around the SLS is deserted.

I recently stayed at the Sahara for the first time for a business trip. My room was on the end of hallway and quiet. I liked using my room key to work the elevator. I also liked that my elevator was close to the self parking garage. It was always an easy transition. Parking is free like it should be. The room was clean and the staff was friendly. I skipped daily cleaning and was given a few extra towels when I asked. The Fridge has a small freezer section big enough for an ice pack. Ice is available on another floor. You need the upgrade to get coffee in the room so I went with cold coffee in a bottle. The pools all three were closed for renovation. As a swimmer this could have been killer but I was busy with other things. It was my fault for not clearing the situation ahead of time. I expect the finished product will be nice. What set the Sahara apart for me was the customer service. My business partner and I needed some immediate help having missed the closure of the FedEx Ship Center. it is an unmanned center I believe. We had urgent correspondence that needed to go out tonight. it is our fault that we waited. Symone was not only friendly but helpful. She showed a great deal of patience as she cheerfully helped us with scanning and transmitting a document. I loved that we chatted while she was willing to repeat the process or try again or whatever was necessary. I actually had a very stressful day waiting to hear from my godson who lives in Nashville because of the tornados. I do n\u2019t need to share details. Having to get this correspondence out tonight could have been another real stressor. I credit Symone with me helping to finish the day well. I did not mention my personal issues but I do not think it would have mattered. I expect she is the same with everyone. She is effervescent and would be a credit to ANY customer service team. So in the end it was a good stay. I heard from my godson and got an important document to its destination. The great customer service almost makes up for the pool refurbishment that I did not know about till I got here. Actually my fault for not checking In closing we enjoyed our experience at the Sahara.
