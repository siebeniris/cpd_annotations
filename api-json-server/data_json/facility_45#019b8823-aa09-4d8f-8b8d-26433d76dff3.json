Arrived for a 2 night stay in March 2015. The hotel is beautifully situated with a beachside location near the Southernmost point of the USA. Good parking facilities. Room was ideal with a balcony overlooking the pool and beach. Meals were served on terrace overlooking the beach. The only gripes were that there appeared to be no outdoor bar the only one we found was in a dark gloomy room adjacent to the restaurant. We resorted to buying a bottle of wine drinking it in our room. Even more surprising was that when we asked for gluten free bread at breakfast we were told that they had none.

I am posting now because I have been on the road. We stayed at the Reach in mid December. I have been reading the other reviews and am so glad we came just before high season kicked in because we paid a fraction of the price that seems to have been charged over Christmas and New Years. We had the best time ever and would come back in a heartbeat if we were in Key West again. Our experience is a little different because we initially did not book at this hotel we booked at the Doubletree for two nights. Yes the price of the Doubletree was more reasonable BUT. it turned out not have a sunset view it did not have a beach or any view of water other than the pool one needed to take a shuttle to downtown which was quite a ride and only went once an hour and we did not like the room we were assigned. So we switched to the Reach for the second day. As a Diamond member we were upgraded to the wonderful oceanview suite of which I have attached pictures and that changed our entire Key West experience. Location location location. The Reach is in the perfect location. Far enough from Duval to be very quiet and peaceful at night but only half an hours walk to Malory Square at a leisurely pace. The Southernmost Point is only two blocks away. You can walk to it early in the morning before the big lineups start and get your picture beside the iconic buoy. The trolley stops are only a block or two away from the hotel. We bought passes on the internet and then grabbed a trolley to downtown we did some sightseeing and then hopped the trolley back to the hotel so we could use the beach and pool. At around four of the clock we started the walk to Malory Square which was extremely pleasant. We walked back to the hotel along Duval after the sunset celebration it turned out to be a great plan. Yes the valet parking was steep but we did not take out our car the entire time. After we checked out the bellboy loaded our car with our luggage and the hotel let us leave the loaded car in the garage until we came back later in the afternoon. TIP. There is a great souvenir shop about a block away from the hotel along the walk to the Southernmost Point I think it is also the stop for the Old Town Trolley. There is a good variety of merchandise and the prices are lower than they are downtown. We were told that we could also use the facilities of the Casa Marina the sister property so we went over there before we left. The Reach has a much nicer and cleaner beach than its sister property with easier access. There are hammocks on the beach to lounge in and listen to the surf the pool is lovely. We did not actually use the pool we used the showers adjacent to rinse ourselves from the beach but just looking at the beautiful blue of the pool from our balcony was so relaxing. Service was exceptional. From the wonderful bellboy forgot his name but attached a picture who cheerfully and easily juggled our myriad pieces of luggage to the valet parkers and the front desk staff everyone we encountered was capable friendly and helpful. As I sit here now in my igloo in frigid Toronto I can not help but smile at what a fantastic time we had at the Reach and in Key West.", "offset": [2359, 2486], "date": "2016-01-05", "cpt": "0", "category": "facility"}, {"id": 5, "uid": "b3513d92-64a4-45f5-8cfe-d7115fc6cab1", "sentence": "Historic charm.

The tile in the shower looked dirty though I am sure it was clean. The amenities were scarce and bare essentials. The staff was more aligned with an economy level property. Certainly not overly welcoming or eager to take our experience to the next level. Certainly not the Waldorf experience I have come to know and love.

I honestly can not believe that anyone would give this place more than a 2 star review. The location is good this is the most interesting and fun part of Key West.

The building itself is shabby with dirty corners and stairwells a dirty elevator which was overdue for inspection. Our room was not as described the room we booked advertised a tile floor and a minibar. This room had neither and were were greeted with a dirty rug and gum stuck to the floor. There was no dresser to put clothes in so we had to live out of suitcases for the entire week which was obnoxious. There were no chairs to sit on the balcony and the balcony overlooked partially the parking garage and partially a rusty storage tank. The street light outside of the room emitted a horrific shrieking buzz periodically during the night which made it difficult to sleep. Our daily housekeeping did not occur until late in the afternoon one day after 730pm. Even when requesting housekeeping it would not happen for hours. The phone in the room did not work and was missing buttons so we could not call the front desk. The toilet did not flush correctly.
