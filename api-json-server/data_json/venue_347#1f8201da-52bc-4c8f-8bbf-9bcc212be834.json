LOCATION. One block from Fountain Square downtown a gathering place hosting free concerts other cultural events as well as a seasonal ice rink. Fountain recognized from opening credits of WKRP in Cincinnati tv show. Walking distance to eateries cafes shopping. Bustling downtown streets during the day and the Panera Bread has a long line in the morning so allow yourself some time. Can be a little intimidating walking at night if you are not used to being inner city. PARKING. You can pull up on the front curb to pick up drop off unload luggage with no hassle. They have outdoor attendants to answer your questions assist you. This is more of a full service type hotel with a doorman valet parking and such. If you are from the west like us you are probably more comfortable with DIY and they are fine with that too. The parking service provided by the hotel is 30 night but you can self park for 10. 15 night depending on what time you arrive and how long you are out during the day. We only came back to the hotel to park after dark and we left early each morning. The entrance to the garage is on the same block on Vine Street between 6th and 7th. it is a short walk to the hotel if you remember to orient yourself there are many exits. If you do not remember to orient yourself the most you will walk is around a city block. Best to drop off your luggage with someone in your party before parking. BED BEDDING. Most people only use a hotel room for sleeping so I like to comment on how that went. The bed was firmer than most and did not sag at all so that was appreciated. The bedding was clean and cozy and there was a variety of pillows so most people would find one to suit them. NOISE. We were in an interior room so there were no outside noises. It was very quiet we rarely heard any noise from within the hotel either. BATHROOM. Good size split into two areas. HUGE tub. Very good lighting. The shower had ample hot water and excellent water pressure with a shower head that offered multiple settings. We have very thick hair so this is always a must for us to be able to rinse shampoo out. Excellent quality towels and 2 robes provided in closet. MIRRORS. I always comment on mirrors because I am nearsighted and I can not put on eye makeup with a counter depth distance between me and the mirror. This room. only had mirrors with a counter in front of them so not to my liking. But with two bathroom areas each with mirrors and 2 sinks it was easy for 3 people to get read in the morning. AMENITIES. This is a big deal TWO LUGGAGE RACKS. Thank you Cincinatian. I will never understand why so many hotels supply ONE luggage rack in a 2bed room. there is a mini fridge but it is a sealed mini bar and we did not dare break the seal. We were splurging but not to that extent. No microwave or coffee maker. but there was a cable TV and hair dryer as well as an iron and ironing board. Actual glass water glasses were so much nicer than plastic. Hot water coffee creamer etc available each morning in lobby very helpful. The room had not been updated to include easy access outlets for charging devices so that was not as convenient as it could have been. We did not use the exercise room or pool or any other facilities amenities if they had them. SERVICE. No doubt their service is second to none but we did not require anything in particular. There was no shortage of helpful looking staff in the lobby area. OVERALL The room was really enormous by hotel standards. We had a full sitting room where the TV was as well as another sitting area on a balcony overlooking the interior of the hotel. It was a little time worn but clean and everything worked. Nice historical touches throughout mouldings doors brass key entry squeaky floorboards under carpeting but very well sound and heat insulated. Ethernet cable port on desk but no outlets. Affordable through Priceline name your own price. MUST SEE.

This is a beautiful old style inner city hotel with a stunning lobby gorgeous huge central staircase with marble steps and beautiful woodwork. When we visited the lobby and common areas were decorated for Christmas and it was spelbindingly beautiful. The staff is fantastic. You are made to feel like a VIP even if you are not we were not. The server at the very inviting bar lounge was wonderful. We were weary from a long drive and she made us relaxed and comfortable. The fine dining restaurant the Palace is supposed to be exquisite although we did not dine there. It is very elegant and peaceful looking and the menu looks fabulous. Other reviewers have mentioned parking problems and it is true they have no hotel parking but there is valet service at the front door expensive and there is a 24hr public garage within 30 feet so I do not see what the complaint is we had no difficulties. The one problem we did have was that we had asked for a quiet room away from the ice machine and elevators. We got that however we could still hear the elevators and ran into something unexpected. Our room had large fixed windows that overlooked the huge atrium like area above the lobby directly above the bar lounge area. Being a Friday night the bar filled up with a crowd that got louder and louder and the noise coming through the closed windows even 3 floors above the bar was very disturbing making sleep impossible until the bar quieted down. I am not overly sensitive to noise while trying to fall asleep and can do so in NYC with traffic noise but this was very difficult to take. That is my only real negative comment about the hotel. The room was clean nice typical of an older city hotel. Nothing fancy but comfortable. The huge double shower was very nice. I would stay there again but would ask for a room that did not face the atrium area. I like older hotels and this is a beauty especially the common area. Again the people who received us and served us were incredible and the price is quite reasonable for a big city hotel.

This could have been a serious issue considering the monetary sentimental value of what a person may have in their possession and left behind in room. Relocating to Room 317 proved not much better. There were a few devices in the room that made no sense of their existence. Extra smoke and carbon monoxide detectors and devices in bathroom that made no sense.
