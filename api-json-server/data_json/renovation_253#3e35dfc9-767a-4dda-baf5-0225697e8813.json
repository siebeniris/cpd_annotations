As a silver privilege member of Mariot we have stayed at Mariot hotels throughout the world and choose to be loyal to the brand as they generally set an excellent standard that is consistent to their brand image. With my husband booked in for surgery tomorrow we decided to take a relaxing break in an Executive Room at the Brisbane Mariot last night as a local Mariot that is advertised as 5. we had high expectations of this hotel particularly after our experiences at the Gold Coast Mariot which have all been exceptional. I used the new Mariot ap to check in and have to admit to being impressed with this service but have not included that in the hotel rating as it is a separate function. We were allocated a room on the 27th floor on of the hotels allocated executive levels and our first impressions of the room were that it looked a bit old and tired and had a damp odour lingering. I can not comment on the normal rooms but if this as the standard of the executive levels then I would anticipate that the non executive levels would be even more tired and in need of refurbishment. As I had skipped breakfast yesterday morning we decided to grab a late lunch around 3 pm and went to Motion Bar and Grill we ordered drinks as we were seated in the restaurant nothing fancy just a draught beer and a lemon and lime bitters the manager who took the order walked off and then came back to take our food order clarifying with my husband the draught he had ordered. We were not offered water to accompany our meal and yet saw other patrons being seated by waitresses being brought glasses of water to the table before they even ordered. We ordered off the 10 min menu selection duck spring rolls and potato wedges. The Manager who had taken our drinks order was wandering around a table of conference delegates many of which were attractive young women who were eating and he was topping up glasses and chit chatting. This continued for about 10 mins and our drinks still had not appeared. Fed up of waiting we asked a waitress where our drinks were and they eventually arrived with our food 20 mins after we had ordered the restaurant was not particular busy. Once our food came the manager came to ask us if everything was okay and we expressed our frustration at waiting 20mins for a drink at this point he started laughing at us brushing off the poor service he then asked if we wanted water a bit belatedly so we said no thanks and he went off and brought 2 glasses to our table. When we booked the room there was meant to be a bottle of fizzy wine on arrival it was not there when we checked in I waited 2 hours for it to materialise amd when it had not I had to call down and request that it be brought to us. We then went to the Executive lounge for canap\u00e9s and cocktails I went to get a cup of tea and was disappointed there were no English breakfast tea bags there however they had decaf so I went to brew a cup. There was no fresh milk out for the tea so I had to use milk froth from the coffee machine. As I was walking back to the table a jug of milk was brought out and placed on the side table not refrigerated this was at around 540. This milk was then left sitting on the side all night and was still there after 930 when we left the lounge. I am appalled at this very poor hygiene practice at such a prestigious hotel. It also made me wonder about food hygiene in general was it a lack of knowledge or a lack of regardWe missed breakfast as we had a meeting with a relative planned but went to the Executive lounge at 11 am to grab a coffee and a cold drink the lounge is advertised as 24hr however when we arrived there were no cold drinks available and again there was no milk for tea and no breakfast tea surely some uht milk cartons could be placed in a bowl on the side table which would allow for them to be constantly available and negate any food hygiene issues. On check out we filled in the express checkout form took it to the counter and gave my debit card details. I requested an email receipt which I received later this afternoon. On checking the receipt I noticed I was charged 770 credit card surcharge and so phoned the hotel to advise. After 10 minutes on the phone to reception I had the money recreated to my bank account but no explanation as to why the money was taken as we paid with a debit card. All of these issues are things that you would not associate with a reputable brand 5 hotel that we paid almost 400 a night for the privilege to stay there.

We had booked the presidential suite so one would expect the best the hotel had to offer for starters the executive lounge was never manned not once during our visits to it. Odd cold drink and coffee and some nuts available but that was it never got to see if it was better as we ate our dinner out and breakfasts in the main restaurant. The accommodation the views from the windows were nothing short of spectacular the bathroom was large and well appointed and the amenities were of a good quality. The bed was fantastic to sleep in the best of any of the hotels we had stayed at in Australia. The suite whilst on first impression was impressive on closer inspection was a bit tired and in desperate need of a make over. The big issue we had was that the light system was not working properly and it seemed as though the maintenance people were incapable of sorting it out if you turned on a light in the lounge an entrance room light went out it was chaotic and for the entire stay we were there we could not turn off the spot lights in the dining room which resulted in the temperature equaling that of a sauna. As said when one says in the top room that the hotel has to offer one would expect better service unfortunately this was not forthcoming reception failed to see the urgency of my complaint no one likes to sleep with the lights on refused to escalate it to the GM and only when I started shouting at the reception staff in the reception area did they deem it necessary to notify the gen manager who came to see us placate us but did little to solve the issue when he next saw us he asked if all was ok. it was a hopeless situation to which I answered yes as were going to check out the next morning. As an aside we had to spend hours extra in the room as the maintenance crews could not get the safe sorted out and it had locked our cash and jewellery in it this transpired twice and only on the 3rd attempt after I complained that my idea of going from South Africa to Brisbane on holiday was not one planned around guarding our asts whilst strangers rummaged through them.

Finally what I thought was the best part of the location is the access to the public walking running trail next to the river which I used for exercise on both mornings. The hotel is an older property but appears to be fairly recently renovated. The rooms are fitted with nice new furniture and carpet as well as very comfortable beds and linens. The bathroom was also renovated with a great large shower stall no tub and lots of room.

New decor which was very much needed as it was more than old and tired. The rooms are small but neat and now the decor is contemporary and brings this art deco inspired building into the modern era. You will now also find large tvs that are wall mounted. Rooms include wonderfully large chaise lounges that offer a window seat to relax and enjoy your view city or river and a practical desk to set up your laptop including free wifi for a week. This hotel is now on par now with most other modern hotels and will give its rival the riverside Stamford a run for its money seeing it is still yet to be renovated. Separate bath and shower is one of the reasons that I opt for this hotel along with the riverside cbd location. WHAT IS COMPLIMENTARY. Bottled water and the usual tea coffee with limited milk provided. I called up for additional bottled water which they gladly provided. I did not check out the gym so I ca nt comment on this as I opted for a riverside jog before breakfast. WHAT IS NOT PROVIDED. WHAT YOU WOULD EXPECT IN A 5 STAR HOTEL. No complimentary bath robes or slippers. I missed these as I am accustomed to using these in 5 star hotels. A night service in which they turn down the bed lights and provide additional water is standard in luxury hotels. I would also expect a larger room for a 5 star hotel and more technology ie electronic lights blinds or a tv in the bathroom. The decor would also be at a more luxurious level in a 5 star hotel. Complimentary umbrellas more personalised customer service are also feature of 5 star. Notably the level of professionalism and customer service of the staff were not at the level of a 5 star hotel. So I could not consider this Mariot to be a 5 star hotel sorry. But it is a lovely hotel and great value for money. HAPPY TO SEE Ticks the boxes re in room electronic safe and hangers in the wardrobe along with iron and ironing board. The bathroom has a make up mirror and hairdryer. TOILETRIES are always a special subject for some of us women. the Mariot have opted for Than. You will find additional toiletries now which is appreciated shaving kits and the like for men and mouthwash. So not just the regular soap shower gel and shampoo etc. I still needed to bring along my own bath oil bubble bath bath salts for my soak. 5 STARS. Despite the marble bathrooms I reiterate that I would not consider this a luxury hotel per se. It is advertised at 5 stars but that is far from accurate. I would expect a much higher level of professionalism and customer service to be considered 5 stars along with improved amenities. But nonetheless it is a perfectly good hotel just not luxury. One thing to note is the noise at this hotel. I asked for a room away from the elevators and was given a quieter location near the end of the corridor. However as the rooms are not very large I was awoken at 1 am in the morning when my hotel neighbour decided to watch tv which of course woke me up until they decided to go to sleep. So you are not guaranteed a good nights sleep in such circumstances. It is worth bringing along your own ear plugs as none are provided. I did not dine at the hotel newly renovated and breakfast is not thrown in so I preferred to eat out at the new Howard Wharf along the river. CONCLUSION. If you are wanting a central cbd hotel close to the Brisbane river with the basic amenities modern decor and a separate bath and shower and being well priced at an average of 200 night for the most basic room city view room then this one of the best options in Brisbane.", "offset": [0, 56], "date": "2019-06-23", "cpt": "1", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 17, "uid": "1f2bf347-ac34-4305-b8c6-f4132e7c3a1b", "sentence": "Exceptional Service by Lloyd.

I stayed at the Mariot twice around April and May this year on business trips. After a lot of business travel in Asia I found that there was something lacking in this hotel that made me search for another hotel in Brisbane. I ended up spending the next four stays at another Bonvoy hotel that I felt was more stylish. Firstly the rooms are good nicely renovated to a good international standard. I was Bonvoy gold at the time and was upgraded to nice rooms on the 20something floor with great view of the river. The only exception was the water pressure which is not great. Also the staff that I encountered are keen to please definitely pleasant and seem to have been trained. The gym is also OKHowever for a five star hotel there were some things that undermined the experience that I think could be fixed so I am offering all the following as constructive criticism. When you walk in there is no greeting or sense of arrival or being welcomed. The lobby space is sort of sparce and a few times when I checked in the checkin desk was empty until someone came out from the back room. Quite a few times I had be walking around and there was no good morning. good afternoon etc. Once there was a time when a system upgrade cancelled all the guest keys and no one in the hotel seemed to take charge of the situation. every guest that came in was going up to their room then back to the check in until someone birod a note on the lift then a few hours later replaced it with a printed sign to key your key fixed. Another time there was a function on in the lobby and dining room and it felt awkward as a guest to enter and know how to navigate around this to get to the lifts. To me these are small things but signs of a lack of leadership in regard to the guest experience with staff doing their best as individuals but not coordinated. Then to me the dining room to be feels kind of cold and uninviting. To be fair it almost always seemed to be full around 6 pm with people having afternoon drinks after work. I had dinner there one night and it was OK but even after a new renovation to me it could be a lot cosier and comfortable. At breakfast there is a separate charge to have a barista coffee. To me this is a really cheap move and it kind of makes the whole thing feel like a user pays budget experience rather than 5star.
