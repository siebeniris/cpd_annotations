Great Hotel. The service at this hotel is outstanding. From the time we arrived to the time we left we were greeted with warm smiles and friendly service. Everyone from the valets to front desk to the waiters to the pool attendants are always willing and eager to assist. The evening concierge Mickey was amazing. On a scale of 1 10 10 being excellent service we would give Mickey 20 because he went above and beyond to make sure that we were comfortable happy and aware of all of the best spots in Miami for shopping and entertainment. Dining at the hotel was also very good. We ate dinner at the more casual restaurant Corsair twice during our stay. The food was delicious and our waiter Ares made sure that we lacked nothing. The Bourbon Steak restaurant was also very good in terms of taste and efficiency we literally received our order in less than ten minutes. Chyrstian at the Lounge Bar can make an excellent cocktail for sure. The food from the Laguna Grill by the pool is also pretty good. We also ate there twice. Again the service we received from Janin I hope I got the name right was awesome. The rooms are pretty big and come with complimentary coffee and everything else you would expect of a resort like this. Since we love to shop we believe the location of the hotel is perfect because the Aventura Mall is basically across the street. We drove to the mall it took us two minutes. but the hotel does provide a complimentary shuttle service to and from the mall for convenience. Overall the pros are the service location room size quality free wifi and the pool area they have a lazy river and a big slide. The cons would have to be that it is more on the expensive side eg valet parking costs a pretty penny. Despite the cost though we would definitely stay here when we visit Miami again.", "offset": [1641, 1743], "date": "2016-06-20", "cpt": "0", "category": "parking"}, {"id": 3, "uid": "ae02e95e-8467-4a88-a0be-3eaaacbabbd4", "sentence": "Much to recomend. On our return trip from Cuba a few weeks ago we wound up getting stranded in Miami for a few unplanned days as a result of an airline glitch. We wound up staying at this property which was convenient to family and friends who live down there. I am quite familiar with Turnbery having lived here many years ago and having belonged for several years to the club which is part of the hotel. During the 1980s Turnbery Isle Yacht Raquet Club which Turnbery Isle Miami now ocupieswas home to both the notorious and the famous with headlines being made in both good and bad ways almost constantly. Some of you may remember when Senator Gary Hart was caught aboard the boat Monkey Business with a woman not his wife. That was here. IN any event the place has calmed down substantially since those heady days and what remains is a really lovely hotel with both a good casual restaurant and the obligatory steak house on premises. A morning buffet rounds out the food offerings. All of the food is at least good but quite pricey. You may want to check out Aventura Mall across the street owned by the same group which has several popular restaurants including the perpetually busy Cheesecake Factory which invariably has a wait of over an hour. The rooms in the tower wing furthest from the reception area are newest and are quite large and pleasantly appointed. The bathrooms are beautifully designed and are furnished with superb toiletries and towels. The view will be of the golf course primarily or of distant condo buildings as this property is a couple of miles west of A1A and the beaches. Nevertheless getting to the beach is a 5 minute drive over the Lehman Causeway. You will find silly priced mini bar items in the room. Keep your kids away unles you enjoy sticker shock when your bill is presented. Valet parking no option adds 40 a night to your tab. Being here in the low season August is a treat because the large swimming pool and luxurious lounges are almost empty. You will help yourself to a fluffy towel and snooze contentedly by the pool with no one to bother you. A waiter may be available to get drinks or you can get one yourself at the pool barit is a luxurious place Turnbery. IF you are a golfer there are two immense 18 hole courses surrounding the property at which you may play for a reasonable price. Driving range practice balls are included in the price of the room if you just want to tune up your swing after lunch. My final analysis. This is a fine place to stay if you happen to get stranded in South Florida for a couple of days. it will not cost you much more than the Courtyard across the street and if you sit in the marble lobby and look at the walls covered with pictures of the owner Mr Sofer and mostly sports celebrities from the days when Reagan was president you might hear echoes and ghosts of Miami Vice and imagine Pots andTubs those were their names were not they. strolling in in pastel suits and blow dried hair.", "offset": [1820, 1872], "date": "2016-08-22", "cpt": "0", "category": "parking"}, {"id": 4, "uid": "a75b29d1-066a-4cab-84c5-6ef6cfac3c86", "sentence": "Guaranteed Luxury. I stayed here with my wife son for 5 nights in August 2016 and could not help but be impressed.

The only negative was the parking.

BUT Stayed at the Turnbery during a business conference the week of April 23. We arrived a day early so fortunately we missed a lot of the crowds that have been mentioned in other reviews. We had a rental car and the parking valet line coming in to the resort was frequently long but less troublesome when we wanted to go outside of the resort since we could call down and have the car waiting for us. We had a lovely room quite large with a balcony overlooking the golf course. Honestly the view could not have been better. Too bad we could not enjoy it on the balcony as much as we would have liked since it seems like there was a child care facility very nearby and where there are lots of kids there is usually lots of volume. To be fair it was not always noisy but there were a couple of occasions when at least one unhappy child was making it clear that he. she would rather have been somewhere else. Even that would have been okay if we had not been awakened at sunrise every morning by a gas motor utility vehicle driving past probably on its way to groom the golf course. Suffice it to say that the engine was VERY loud and disruptive to ones sleep since you could hear it coming from a distance and the noise lingered even after it had passed by. We were pleasantly surprised by the luxury bath and dressing rooms. However we are pretty sure that the laundry was located right next door and with the hotel fully booked laundry was running at all hours of the day and night. We had to keep the bathroom door closed most of the time to avoid hearing the washer dryers in use. We ate in two restaurants on site. Corsair is more casual and while we had a lovely buffet breakfast that we really enjoyed some friends mentioned they had had lunch there that was pretty middle of the road. Michael Minas Bourbon Steak did not disappoint. We particularly enjoyed the family style service of side dishes for everyone at our table to share. The staff was wonderful and very helpful. From the parking valet and bellman who greeted us to the reception housekeeping and grounds staffs the customer service was pleasant and consistent always asking what more they could do to improve our stay. I should note also that we never complained about the things mentioned in the prior paragraph. I am confident however that if we had the staff at Turnbery would have done their best to ensure we were taken care of. All in all a very nice property.

Very different property now I stayed here twice with family during a one week period and until now this hotel had been my favorite in the Miami area. The switch to JW Mariot is a big step down from the Turnbery brand that its management carefully cultivated over the years. they have gone to mass production and conventions and decidedly down market. The problem so far is that things are not really working well we saw luggage going to the wrong room computer stations consistently not working and staff people not knowing things they should know and not being prepared to go out of their way to make things work until a manager stepped in. One time we checked in at 10 pm and our room was still not ready and although our reservation was marked with connecting rooms we did not get them that night they did offer to move us the next day. In the new tower the air conditioning works well the shower water pressure is fair but not particularly good and the rooms are pretty nice although for a new tower i was surprised at how stained our carpet was in one of the rooms already. The hotel was busy and I was not too happy that at 10 pm on a Saturday night room service was backed up an hour and the hotels coffee shop was closed. We ate appetizers in one of the fine dining restaurants that was still open and the front desk comped our dinner which I found out later and which was rather nice of them and unexpected. When we checked in we called 3 times over a 2 hour period to get some door stoppers for our connecting rooms. We waited about half an hour to get our car from the valet. It does not help that when you call on the telephone people do not answer their extensions and we never succeeded the entire stay in reaching the car valets over the phone which is a problem because they tell you to call 15 minutes in advance to allow time to get your car. I would recommend ditching the car for a stay here and just use Uber. The front desk did not reach them either. I was upset that they do not get the New York Times at the hotel and you can not buy it at the sundry shop either. The Wall Street Journals they kept in a closet were gone before 9 am. I never saw a concierge in the lobby so I do not know if there is one. The front desk person said she did not know when the concierge shows up and I was perturbed because I thought that someone whose station is right in front of the concierge desk ought to know what goes on across from them. But that is what you are now getting here staff people who are not really part of a whole hotel but just compartmentalized in their own little worlds. The new pool area is a bit like a theme park you go through an entrance area with turnstyles and a scan of your wrist band to make sure you can enter. The pool area is cool in design with warm water and the water slides are average. no big deal but nice. It is hard to get shade which is really tough in the hot summer sun and by 11 it is hard to find a lounge. You have to climb a tower of about 4 5 stories for each ride and there is a limit as to how many times anyone is willing to do this. The Flow Rider is hugely busy they make you sign a waiver each and every day and my kids just gave up looking at the long lines to get on it. The hotel sells day passes and we saw a lot of people paying for things with cash and credit card which is a good sign that they are day pass guests the hotel is cheapening its resort by letting too many outsiders in to give their guests a good experience and it is not a relaxing place by any means as you might hope for in a resort. The crowd at the pool is different than it used to be and you see a lot of body paint around. Breakfast at the Corsair has definitely been Mariotized they got rid of many things they used to have and the quality is definitely down. A few years ago a buffet breakfast here was in the top 10 of hotels in America in my opinion and my wife was taking home recipes for home made cakes. The elevators in the tower have temporary certificates in them that expired in March and it is 3 months later. I saw the county inspector there and nobody seems to be bothered by it because the certificates are in the office but good management puts up their certificates and this kind of thing adds to the feeling that the place is just becoming too large to be managed well and that management is just not on it and walking the floor. I really got the feeling throughout that Mariot did not send in their A Team to take over this property when it opened up its new tower and shifted its focus to groups. I do not think that guests of Turnbery are going to want to be put on hold with a recording for several minutes every time they want to talk to someone at the hotel and have lots of extensions simply not picking up the phone ie for instance the front desk tried to call the business center at 9 am and nobody picked up. Three elevators for a 17 story tower is not enough especially when bellmen are using the same elevators for check ins and check outs and when one elevator goes out as it did when we were there. The hotel is dominated by groups and can not handle the turnover they told us that they could not possibly clean 400 rooms by 10 pm. One morning at breakfast there was only one person manning the omlete station and a line of 8 people waiting. Lifeguards at the pool do not have bandaids around and the person watching the exit of the water slide can not tell you where a pair of lost goggles in that pool goes from there. Lots of people wait in line at the front desk and computers do not work. You get the idea. The hotel has so many promotions going on that when you check out you really have to go over your bill to make sure the proper credits have been applied. It used to be very hard to use Mariot points at this property you can now use them which also means you have more guests coming with points than paying cash which is a disincentive for a property to provide quality goods and services. The gym here remains excellent and the spa is OK they need investment there. The Swiss shower was being repaired when I visited and it was the same thing last time I was there a year or so ago. A resort like this should have a better spa more than just a waiting area and some treatment rooms a locker room and a sauna. My feeling is that the way forward for this place is to take one of the buildings such as Jasmine and make that a boutique hotel within a hotel that runs at a 5star level and cater to their clientele with that carve out. Otherwise the kind of guests that would go to Turnbery will probably be looking for another property to take its place. We would not think of going back unles we knew that this place got its act together. Hardly anything we did here was hassle free and I do not care how cheap it is it is not what I want in a resort. I saw a VIP area at the pool area but if I were a VIP I do not know that I would want to be here in the first place. I wonder why the owner trashed his own brand to do this I guess he thought this kind of mass market property would be more profitable.
