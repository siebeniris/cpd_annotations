Just checked out from here as I was visiting friends in Philadelphia this weekend. I will start with the positive neutral items Great location in Center City incredibly close and within walking distance to Philys great nightlife and shoping I booked using SPG points and would say that I received tremendous value for the point spend Fitness center and bar were on par with what I had expect from a Westin property. Kudos to the great customer service and pleasant attitude from all of the bartenders Same as above with room in general fairly on par with Westin standards. As for the not so pleasant aspects and why I would only rate this property 3 stars Bathroom was small and seemed dated below average from my experiences What really detracted from this trip was the general demeanor of many of the staff and the fact that the property really blew it in terms of delivering the Westin Weekend experience. With the exception of the bartenders none of the staff with whom I interacted were particularly pleasant people few smiles seemingly irritated to serve me. Like many folks I gravitate to Westin properties for quick weekend trips due largely to their Westin Weekend promotion. Apparently this hotel was over subscribed this weekend. When I requested a 4 PM late checkout I am a SPG Gold Member I was curtly informed by one of the staff members that 130 PM was the absolute latest available. No apology no smile. That by itself would not be a big deal I understand how the industry works and I would be super irritated if my room were not available for a 3 PM check in. However the hotel staff seemed to go out of their way to passively aggressively suggest that they wanted folks out of their rooms as soon as possible on Sunday. When I arrived back on Saturday night there was a note from the hotels general manager informing me that they would not be granting any checkout requests after 12 PM for anybody due to it being a busy weekend and even offering 150 SPG points for folks who checked out before 10 AM. When I called the front desk to confirm my 130 late checkout the staff seemed irritated that I even bothered to ask but said that I was all set. Then this morning I was interrupted not once but three times twice by housekeeping once by somebody looking to check the minibar before 130 despite having my do not disturb sign displayed. Again it was very clear that they wanted me out as soon as possible to make way for arriving guests. it is quite irritating as a Gold member as I find it ludicrous to think that this property has hordes of Platinum elites arriving early on Sunday. I will comment further that I have had similar weekend experiences with other Westin properties though without the poor attitude experienced here. If Starwod is going to create an entire marketing campaign around the Westin Weekend experience including a standard 3 PM check out on Sunday they need to be able to more consistently execute on it. And again I am a Gold member. I imagine the general public must be even more consistently disappointed when they expect a slow and relaxed Sunday only to have the hotel try to push them out of their rooms as soon as possible. Overall I had a great trip. I actually would book this property again due to the on par quality good price for value and great location and also because I want to give them the benefit of the doubt this was unusually poor customer service from a Westin so I will assume they were just having a bad weekend due to being busier than expected.", "offset": [2627, 2773], "date": "2016-10-23", "cpt": "1", "category": "atmosphere"}, {"id": 11, "uid": "ba40a2dd-3f79-408e-a7f3-ac88e8a0fea8", "sentence": "Convenient and Clean.

I have stayed at a number of philadelphia hotels over the past few months and I have to say that for the price the Westin Philadelphia was underwhelming at best.

When you first walk in you are in a false lobby and you take the elevator to the 2nd floor real lobby. Pro tip there is a door that leads you to the mall that is not obvious but it is there. First problem was during check in I was staying one night and inquired about the ability to get a suite upgrade checked in fairly early in the day as well. The front desk agent said that none were available even though on the Westin website it still showed suites available to be booked. Huge pet peeve I understand if the place is fully booked but it was relatively empty. I did get a room on the top floor thought it was pretty noisy in the halwayThe room itself was well appointed spacious and for the most part comfortable. I had a bit of a view of a courtyard and another tall building but it was better than nothing. The internet worked and was speedy enough. The bathroom was also decent really liked the marble. However the bathtub was very discolored and needed to be replaced or refinished really marred the experience.

My husband and I recently stayed at this hotel because we had a wedding near by. Here are the pros and cons of the Westin Phily based on our personal experience. PROS1. The location is excelent walking distance to all the hot spots2. The staff was friendly everyone from the doormen servers reception etc were very nice3. After experiencing some unpleasantness in our first room more on that in a bit we were upgraded to a much better rom4. The restaurant in the hotel served a great lunch. CONS1. The housekeeping of the hotel is more than questionable When we first checked in we were brought to a our first room which was very small but that is besides the point and immediately noticed something was wrong. The place smelled like someone had just gone to the bathroom so we checked the toilet and there were skid marks ALL over the toilet. It was clear that someone had just gone to the bathroom there before we checked in. Another clue that someone had been there before us was that the snack tray by the TV which has specific slots for each snack had multiple missing snacks. I guess someone poed grabbed snacks and then took off. I sprayed Lysol EVERYWHERE and wiped down the bathroom with antibacterial wipes but my husband said this is ridiculous and called the front desk. After 20 minutes of waiting around we were taken to a new small room a housekeeping representative came in and seemed skeptical of our account which was frustrating. Our new room was also very small we are SPG platinum members but were told the hotel was completely booked and there was no way to get an upgrade. My husband called the SPG preferred number and after another half hour we were told by the hotel that they did have an upgrade for us after all. We were taken to a our third room which was large and spacious with a living room area. We were walked there personally by Karem I believe a manager who was very friendly. Once Karem left we felt we could finally relax so my husband joked and said why do not you go and check the toilet in this room. I walked into the bathroom and the toilet ONCE AGAIN was dirty. This time it was just pee and toilet paper but STILL. 2 toilets were totally gross which shows it had not been cleaned before we had come in. At this point we realized we would not be getting a better room than this so I once again sprayed Lysol and wiped down the bathroom. All we could do at that point is laugh2. At the time when we were checking in at the front desk we were asked if we wanted SPG points or vouchers for the breakfast so we chose the vouchers. I asked the lady what are the hours of the breakfast in the morning to redeem the vouchers. She said breakfast starts at 7 am and ends at 3 pm. We were like Wow breakfast ends at 3. that is amazing. And she smiled and said Yes our breakfast runs late. The following morning we went to a museum figuring we have all the time in the world to get our free breakfast so when we got back to the hotel around 130 145 and went to have our breakfast buffet we were told breakfast already ended and that it was an in between time between breakfast and lunch and that we probably would not get served lunch for 45 minutes. We were so confused and told them about what the front desk had told us the evening before. They said that the breakfast only runs until 3 pm for room service. We asked if our vouchers counted for room service and they said no. They were very nice about it it was not there fault we had been misinformed but had we known we would have had breakfast during the CORRECT hours. My husband ended up eating lunch by himself because I had to get ready for the wedding.

I had a reservation from today Nov 2 to Nov 3rd which the hotel intentionally cancelled on Oct 31st so that the hotel can up sale my cheaper pre reserved room at a higher rate because of the high demand and limited room supply in the city for tonight. As a owner and operator of 25 hotels including four Mariot properties I knew that was the case as soon as I received cancellation notification on my Bonvoy ap. So I decided to immediately contacted the property to reinstate my reservation. I spoke to Leonard the night auditor on Nov 1st at 248 am to inquire about the reason for my cancellation. He stated that my card was declined. I told him that my credit company sent me a text message correspondence requesting that I verify the transaction. I verified the transaction and told him to reprocess payment through my card. He said I will reinstate your reservation and you can process payment when you check. Just to recap that The conversation between us I asked him that he is personally guaranteeing accommodating at the property from Nov 2 to Nov 3rd. He stated Yes Mr Patel you have nothing to worry about. Fast forward to today I went to check in and was advised by Juan that my reservation was cancelled. I looked at him with disbelief and said are you kidding me. I spent 30 mins with Leonard on Nov 1st at 2 something am clearing this pertinent issue up. He stated he did not know of this as there was clear lapse of communication between Juan and Leonard so he decided to call him to clarify. Leonard told him that he said to me that I would ONLYbe accommodated contingent to the room availability for tonight. I was shocked again that Leonard would lie and renege on his verbal guarantee to me. Juan refused to take my word and decided to go with Lenard on this which was clearly the wrong choice as the hospitality industry is about customer satisfaction. At the end of the conversation Juan decided to extort me by stating that the only way I would be able to be accommodated at the hotel tonight is if I paid 500 plus hotel occupancy and sales taxes. I was shocked again that someone would try to extortme. At that point I disengaged in dialogue as this was not getting anywhere. This is completely unethical behavior. I request that the management company andor ownership interject immediately and terminate both of their respective employment interests effective immediately. I have stayed here 50 times never encountered a problem like this. For two employees to bluntly lie to my face and even more so make an attempt to extort a very sophisticated businessman serial entrepreneur and hotelier like myself is definitelycrosing that line.
