The hotel offers a very small breakfast but there is a cute little cafe right next door with good food. The whole La Jola atmosphere was very relaxing and peaceful. The neighborhood was quiet with not much until you are about a mile away. I walked all around at different times of the day evening and had no issues. The city bus also allows you to easily go into San Diego downtown but I actually enjoyed La Jola area much more. Just walking along the beach and cliffs breathing in the ocean air.

The hotel and bokingcom websites do not flag this. I wish I knew there was construction still going on then I would not have booked this. Please do check before you book. The hotel description says it is a boutique hotel but its more like an In Motel. The room was newly renovated. The floor board creaked. The bed was not very comfortable. There was no mirror in the room for dressing up. There were a few other things that I did not like eg They did not refill the shower gel and and shampoo. no hooks in bathroom dust from building works outside.
