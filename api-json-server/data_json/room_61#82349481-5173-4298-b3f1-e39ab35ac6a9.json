Asked her if there was any soda available she told him to go to Circle K What was funny was they were filling the machined when we returned from dinner but did not work an hour later. No coffee maker in room but was small pot at the desk. There was water issues everywhere yellow stands around puddles in walk ways and even in the middle of the check in.

Had issues with the room key working in gate to enter the walk way they were well worn keys.
