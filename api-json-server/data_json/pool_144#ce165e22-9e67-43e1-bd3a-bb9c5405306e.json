There are also some great restaurants located nearby in particular 55 East. The room itself was clean and nice and fairly large with great views of Long Beach. Unfortunately the air conditioning struggled to keep up on a hot day. The room service breakfast was excellent right down to the coffee. The workout room was pathetic however and the pool was fairly small and not really appealing. Although the workout room is being refurbished at this time it does not look like they will get any kind of decent weight machines like I see at the Grand Hyat in San Diego for example.

The pool was too hot for me to enjoy would have been more refreshing a few degrees cooler but hubby enjoyed it immensely. Have to give a HUGE shout out to J Kennedy. The Lobby Bar she really is top shelf when it comes to knowing her customers and how to quench their thirst. Hard working I witnessed her picking up snacks pl had dropped on the floor with a napkinothers were cleaning the whole time we were there as well really clean clean placeBUT I have never seen a bartender come around and clean the floor on the other side of the bar. Really impressed us. She deserves credit for doing such an amazing job and smiling the whole time while pl are yelling at their football teams and she never forgot a drink food order snack or to place a gentlemans forgotten knapsack behind the bar until he realized and came back. Alot of the staff were wonderful while we stayed the weekend but she is the one we will be telling our friends about back home. Thanks for making it a great time J Kennedy you are the Best.

The new room was very clean with a great view. In addition the valet and doorman team was incredible each time I needed my car or whenever I entered and exited. As for the facility the gym was very good with great equipment. In addition it was next to the pool on the back side which provided great sun coverage as well as good views of the city and mountains. In addition the restaurant in the lobby was great for breakfast and also had a very helpful wait staff. Finally the location of the hotel was also great beautifully situated on the palm laced Ocean Drive directly across from performing arts and convention center. The location was even better when you think it equally between the shopping centers in the harbor and the eateries on Pine.

I was excited when I was told we had be staying at the Westin Long Beach because of the heavenly beds. I was there for a work conference and brought my family along to continue our Spring Break holiday that had started in Vegas. Michael checked me in and did not give me an upgrade because I am not at a certain level in my Mariot Reward Status. If I were a Chairman I think he said I had get an automatic upgrade to their penthouse. I told him if no chairmans showed up that night to remember my family and I. He did not think that was funny. Yes the hotel is under renovation and looks like it however they made it for it by giving out complimentary champagne with blueberries daily for a few hours and they had free coffee and muffins croissants as you left the hotel which was nice. The room was tiny for our family of 5. Since my work covered the room I could not complain and thankfully my kids did not even though they had just returned from staying at the all suite Palazo in Vegas. The good news was that they did bring in a big rolaway bed which our teenage daughter liked very much. I expected a little cot like they gave me at the Fairmont Hotel in San Jose but this was a full sized bed which was very nice for her but made our room even more cramped. After our 3rd day we opted for maid service and removed the do not disturb sign. I came back from the convention center around 30pm and decided to leave because the housekeeper had not cleaned the room and luckily my family was not back from their outing yet either. On my way back out to the convention center I stopped at the front desk and was going to remind Michael give us the Penthouse that is only reserved for Chairmans since our room was not cleaned. Instead I met a sweet girl named Nayeli and asked her about housekeeping times and as I was leaving I quickly asked if they had a slightly bigger room for our family. With a friendly smile she said absolutely. I thanked her and said I had think about it knowing very well my family would have a fit moving all of our stuff on our last night there. Oh well. I came back at 530pm and to my surprise the room was still not cleaned. I called the front desk and asked what happened and they did not know. They put me on hold and when I spoke to the front desk manager he said that they would be glad to send a housekeeper right away. Instead I asked to change to the upgraded room that Nayeli had offered earlier. He said he had have to call me back. My family arrived and I told them we might be moving and of course they were not happy but I wanted a fresh clean spacious room. Instead of a phone call Sergio arrived to take our luggage which of course was not ready but he graciously left the luggage cart with us and returned to move us a little while later. Needless to say the 16th floor room made all the difference. It was not suite nor the Penthouse but it was clean very high ceilings and just the right space than the little room we were in before. We were right next to the elevator and had a pool view. My kids thought the pool and hot tub were fine. Thank you to Nayeli and Sergio who moved us as well as the other Sergio who poured our champagne along with all the other workers who poured our champagne every afternoon which was my highlight of this trip. I have got to mention that I spent two days on the third floor in the Tokyo conference room and that entire area down there was nice with clean bathrooms and the catered box lunch was good. Other days I was at the convention center which is about a 5 minute walk or so from the Westin. Oh I had a chance to visit the Renaissance which is part of the Mariot. Fancy lobby which I think the Westin will have after their renovation. Overall I would not return not even when I am a Chairman. The cramped room slow housekeeping service and forgot to mention the loud jackhammer noises early morning and through out the day that my husband mentioned will keep me from returning.", "offset": [3054, 3101], "date": "2019-04-14", "cpt": "1", "category": "pool"}]}
