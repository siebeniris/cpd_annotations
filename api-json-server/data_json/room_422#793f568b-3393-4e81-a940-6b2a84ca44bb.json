Our room was clean and everything was is working order. The only problem with the room is the door. There is absolutely no noise insulation from the hallway. This is not the only hotel room that has this problem. This is a prevailing problem in lots of places. I should have requested a room towards the end of the wing as I always do. We have reserved the so called BISTRO rate which entitles to breakfast but we were not reminded about it at check in and we did not know we were paying for breakfast until we saw the bill under the door the morning we were checking out. That is unacceptable and the front desk clerk should have told us at check in. We were there for only one night so we still have our breakfast but we had to rush through it to make it on time to our appointment in the morning. I would not recommend buying the Bistro rate the breakfast offered is limited you are handed out a little menu card and you can only pick one hot item or two cold items like a couple of pastries and only coffee or juice. You can not have both unles you pay extra. Also if you order the hot item that is all you can have unles you are willing to pay extra. No free coffee refills either. There is a wonderful diner Silver Diner three minutes away on Greenbelt Rd.

The room had an unpleasant musty order and the rug had many dark spots. like there was food stuck to it. The TV remote needed batteries and did not work. The location is about a half an hour to DC which accounts for the great price. This may work very well for you but our goal was tourism and it turned out to be far. DC is a walking city and we were very tired at the end of our day. Once in Greenbelt there are not many places to eat.

When we checked in we arrived around 6PM in the evening it was INCREDIBLY loud in the lobby with the restaurant immediately to your left as you walk in and is directly across from the check in desk to your right. There were no \u201c buffers \u201d or \u201c barriers \u201d to break up the noise at the restaurant which made check in extremely difficult especially if you have a hearing difficulty. The woman was extremely nice who checked me in and apologized for the loud noise but had to do so by shouting to me. When I checked in I reminded them that I had requested a handicap accessible room and confirmed it over the phone the week prior to our arrival as I use a walker and was traveling there for the purpose of having another brain spine surgery. The front desk clerk looked surprised because there was nothing indicating that on their computer. She quickly did some adjustments assigned us a room on the 1st floor that was handicap accessible. She also told me having to yell over the loud noise again. that since we were booked for 2 weeks our package included breakfast in the restaurant. When I asked her for how many people how that worked she said it was for the 2 people staying in the room. She said the next morning to just give our room to the people at the restaurant in the mornings and it would be taken care of. which was untrue because it was only one. She treated me professionally apologized for the loud noise seemed to genuinely enjoy her job. The staff is certainly the star of this hotel. My husband I went to room but I was extremely upset because I had specifically booked the Courtyard by Mariot King room because it offered a nice sized sofa. I knew that after having surgery on my brain and cervical spine neck it would be important to have some options of places to sit lay rest after returning from the hospital. But for some reason this handicap accessible room DID NOT have the same sofa we saw in all of the pictures. Instead it offered a small chair with no support for the upper back whatsoever. On top of that the door was difficult to even open and close all the way. We went back up to the front desk they seemed surprised at what I was saying. Then she thought I was expecting a suite explained that we had booked just the king room. We were not expecting a suite by any means. We had booked just 1 king room with a circle sofa bed in it the website said about 190 20sq ft. We did n\u2019t expect to have to give up the amenity of the sofa just to have extra room to use my walker. I offered to show the woman pictures and explained the whole reason I needed the sofa was for after surgery. She told me I did n\u2019t need to show her the pictures but they still did n\u2019t know what to do. I just decided to take a regular king room because in all honesty I had been in the car all day and was in a lot of pain. I did n\u2019t want to wait in the loud lobby while they ran to the room or figured out whether they had a king room with the sofa that was actually handicap accessible even though their website says it does. This was not necessarily the way I was hoping to start our long stay at a hotel. When we got up to the regular king room on the 2nd floor it worked out okay for me because I was able to have help around the room if I could n\u2019t get my walker around. It did make me concerned for those who were in a wheelchair however. The Room. The bed bedding was VERY COMFORTABLE. Each side of the bed had its own lamp with outlets as well as a small side table with pull out drawer. There was a mini fridge under the TV but it was had so much built up frost that we could barely fit small drinks in it. Next to the mini fridge were 3 large drawers. Since we were going to be there for a bit these were nice to have to put stuff in including random things we had with us but did n\u2019t want to clutter up the room with. We had to request for a microwave to be brought up to the room which they did without much problems. The TV was on a swivel stand so it could be seen in bed or on the sofa or both. There was a desk chair that was very comfortable and directly below the \u201c desk \u201d area there was a pull out table. It could be pulled out and used at the sofa or at the end of the bed or you could even just swing 1 end out to make a \u201c L shaped \u201d desk. The sofa was a circular shape and you kinda just melted back into. It was well worth the move to make sure we had this couch. It pulled out to a twin bed but we did not use it so I ca n\u2019t comment on it. There was a closet that had luggage rack ironing board iron linens for the sofa bed. Closet was average size that you had expect in a hotel room. The bathroom was okay. It seemed older with newer things like the shampoo dispenser the showerhead the u shape shower curtain added to distract from it being older. Unfortunately it is age still was evident. The lighting in the bathroom itself was not ideal. Pros. Very kind staff members who always were trying to serve us as best as possible. The room after having some initial mix ups with rooms that was sorted out was well planned out with furniture pieces that could be moved configured differently to make your room multi functional. These well thought out designs made the room feel bigger than they really were even though it \u2019s a decent size to begin with. The bed the couch were VERY comfortableThe location seemed to be very close to everything. From what I \u2019ve been told as I was mostly in the hotel the people that stayed with me during my time up there said it was centrally locatedMixed. The lobby restaurant area had plenty of space different types of seating with electrical outlets USB charging stations in almost every piece of furniture at least that I saw but it is so wide open that you kinda feel like everyone can hear your business. Everything is so loud especially if there are any big group there. Cons. The ceilings in the hallways especially on the 1st floor were really low made it feel quite claustrophobic unsettled. The 2nd floor did n\u2019t seem so bad but I did n\u2019t go up past the 2nd florThe mini fridge had a large build up of frost making it nearly impossible to store more than a few things. We also had to request a microwave to be brought to our room. The sidewalks at the back of the hotel were uneven very difficult to use a walker with. It would probably be nearly impossible to use a wheelchair to go in the back entrances. I had booked a king room that had a sofa bed not a suite just a regular king room. I had requested confirmed a \u201c handicap accessible \u201d room over the phone a week before. When I arrived they had nothing indicating this. After switching things up they gave us a handicap accessible room. It was much smaller than the room I booked on Mariot \u2019s website did not have the sofa. Needing room to move a walker or wheelchair around should not mean you do n\u2019t get to have a sofa. We went back down just got a regular room which probably would n\u2019t have worked if I had been in a wheelchair. All in all it was a nice experience but not what I have come to know and expect from the Mariot brand hotels. The staff are the best part of the hotel definitely the best part of the stay. I would stay here again if it were a decent price but I might try a different Mariot hotel next time there were several nearby.", "offset": [5212, 5337], "date": "2018-12-22", "cpt": "1", "category": "room"}, {"id": 16, "uid": "e4a128ef-2f8d-4281-9793-90d46516cea0", "sentence": "Comfortable bed and quiet room Very helpful staff.
