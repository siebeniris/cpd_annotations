I recently completed a business trip to Los Angeles. I chose to stay at the Mondrian because its location was central to the business I had to conduct and I enjoy West Hollywood. I asked for and was given a quiet room away from the pool scene overlooking Sunset. I stayed in a Deluxe Studio room and I loved the clean but luxurious design. The flat screen was hidden in a large swivelling mirror and I enjoyed the use of sheer curtains to provide more separation between spaces in the generously sized suite. I also loved the hardwood floors in my room because carpet in hotel rooms ew. The bed was very comfortable I really enjoyed the powerbar embedded in the nightstand no hunting for outlets to charge my iPhone and iPad. and the room wifi was more than adequate for my business needs fast and constant. The bath amenities definitely kicked it up a notch with generous portions of Malin Goetz products. I ate at the restaurant a couple times and was pleased with the service and ordered take out from the bartenders super busy and super nice guys twice as well as the room service menu is limited. I had drinks at Sky Bar and enjoyed watching folks navigate the chaise lounges drinks and pool. All of the Sky Bar servers were attentive and beautiful. In fact every single person who worked at the Mondrian was unfailingly polite and helpful. Always going the extra step to make me feel cared for. The most extreme example of this was that my room though perfect in every other way lacked something vital for me. A coffee maker. I wake up very early on business trips and having my first cup of the day in my room undisturbed as I begin working on East Coast business is pretty important to me. I called to front desk to have them deliver machine to my room. I was told that the hotel did not have any machines for the rooms but that they brewed an urn of coffee in the lobby starting at 6 am. I was not particularly happy about it but went about my business. The following morning I awoke at 430 am and suffered uncafeinated for 1 12 hours before I was able to get a cup of adequate coffee from the urn. I decided to write a letter to management just to let them know my feelings. I kept it light and polite. I am fully aware that my coffee situation is a leader among first world problems if there ever was one. I sent the email of and went about my day In between meetings I received a reply from the hotel. They had gone out and PURCHASED a Nespreso machine and wanted to know when a good time would be for them to put it in my room. Amazing wonderful and responsive.

However I feel a need to write this from my room given the experience so far this is just my first night. While the staff in general are polite and the valet service was easy to use I am put off by the quality of the room. Firstly the king size bed creaks loudly every time you lay sit move on it. The aircon was blowing hot air instead of cold air. This though is now partially solved thanks to the engineer who just came by. The worst part is the room smells of cigarette smoke and we have no idea where it is coming from. Initially I thought that the smell was coming from the pool as I am on the 5th floor facing the pool. But after checking that all the windows are close as tightly as possible I am lost at what else I can do. The front desk confirmed to me that all rooms are non smoking and if so where is the smell coming from. My whole room is full of it. Sadly there are no rooms available for change tonight. After a long drive from Las Vegas today I am trying to ignore it to sleep but it is really hard as we are non smokers and the smell in the room is overwhelming for us.

After arguing with the front desk that we had already finalised our bill they reluctantly let the charge go. I have stayed at The Andaz twice across the road and would immediately recommend that over this place. For a similar price the service was impeccable the rooms we are clean modern and spacious and have never had a charge we did not know about let alone one a month after checking out.

I was advised to call directly to them in future. The next morning we attended breakfast in the restaurant to find chaos too many patrons and not enough staff from what we could make out. We both ordered food but only one meal arrived. We were short on time again so shared the one dish that turned up and advised staff to cancel the missing order. We were told the hotel was in the process of changing their menu which may have equated for the confusion.

The water faucets clearly had not been wiped. As I am typing this I wish I took photos. I call immediately for someone to clean it and you guessed it another 45 minutes and I had to call twice before someone came.

I could see from the position of the bed out of my peripheral that she was mopping. She leaves we thank her then. I go to get back in the shower and it looks the EXACT SAME. I was SO PERPLEXED AND DISGUSTED. DID NO ONE COMMUNICATE THAT IT WAS THE TUB THAT NEEDED TO BE CLEANED. I FELT LIKE I WAS IN THE TWILIGHT ZONE.

He kindly told me about the best areas to look for a new apartment that would fit my needs and during my stay gave me a list of buildings to check out. The housekeeping and in room dining staff were outstanding as well. The valet staff at any time of day or night were excellent and friendly. We had a good laugh when I accidentally got into a car that was not mine. After a long stay it felt like I was leaving my family. Thank you to everyone at the Mondrian for all your kindness and outstanding service.", "offset": [79, 154], "date": "2020-03-10", "cpt": "2", "category": "general"}]}
