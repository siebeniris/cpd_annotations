Staff untrustworthy. I normally stay at the Aloft because I like the room setup and the beds are comfortable. This Aloft experience was different. The room was clean but the shower could be re grouted. First let me say the front desk staff was welcoming. However I do feel the maid staff should be credited the same. I ended up getting the flu during my stay. So I only had the staff come in a couple of times during the week since I did not want to get them sick. Anyway one day I left my watch in my room. I normally put it on before I leave but this time I forgot to due to my illness. My watch is now missing and I filed a report with the hotel. Never heard back from them. I am not sure if it was the maid staff or someone else within the hotel staff that took my watch. I know that there is a safe for valuables but I never intended leaving my watch behind. It would be nice to not have to be concerned about your things within you room. The topper to all this is the maid staff did not even clean the room well when they didI will never stay here again.", "offset": [56, 144], "date": "2015-02-28", "cpt": "0", "category": "room"}, {"id": 3, "uid": "c905cec0-dfa9-4f35-8174-98fc955ab297", "sentence": "The place is nice and in a good area were all the businesses at very easy to find will always come back here staff is good also and quite in the rooms.", "offset": [0, 151], "date": "2015-04-01", "cpt": "0", "category": "room"}, {"id": 4, "uid": "8ba0c79d-e897-4b76-8217-7231a1c2b80a", "sentence": "Stayed here this weekend and really enjoyed it.

I do not know if the bartender was out sick or if they are limiting the number of staff they hire.

I do not know if that is just because the room they put me in was handicap accessible. However I had a baby with me so she had to shower with me. Not a big problem just did not expect that. There is not a microwave in the room. You have to use the one in the lobby. But there is a mini fridge and a safe. So those were useful. The room was very big. Again I had a handicap accessible room.
