I stayed at the Greensboro Mariot Downtown and I have to say that I was underwhelmed. While the public spaces and service are up to Mariots standards the rooms are no better than a Holiday Inn. They do have most of the standard Mariot touches like the bed linens pillows bathroom amenities however it is really window dressing. The rooms small and not very soundproof. There were wide gaps around the door which let the hallway light in and the window drapes did not function very smoothly. it is evident that they have tried to do as much as possible to make the rooms comfortable but a serious overhaul is needed in my opinion. Basically the hotel is very clean and has great service and the price is reasonable. It if were not a Mariot I would rate it much higher and would stay there again.

I was going to host my event for Local Small Businesses here and I came on Sunday February 17th 2019 and had a photographer to take pics of me holding my flyer by a beautiful seating area in the lobby. A guy sitting in the bar area turned to me right before I was able to take the first pic and said from across the room. I am the front desk manager and unles you have permission from the general manager you can not take pictures in here. My first thought was ok maybe he is joking because why would the front desk manager be siting at the bar talking to me from across the room. I told him about the even I was having and said that I was trying to promote. He then restated Well unles you have permission you are not able to take pictures in here. At that moment I was thinking ok what kind of rule is this because this is a lobby and when people go on vacation they take pictures. Heres where it got WORST. I said to him May I have the general managers contact information to which he replied I m not authorized to give you that information. If he is the front desk manager would not he be able to give me that General Managers information. I m not talking about her SN her Place of birth or anything personal. When you are a General manager of a hotel usually you have a business card at the front desk. I then asked him What is your name. Adonas. He replied. I said ok thank you and left. I had to take my pics outside that day as cold as it was and I also took some at UNCG because they were more hospitable than the Mariot hotel. After I finished I called back to the hotel asking for the number to corporate. Adonas answered the phone. When I asked for the number to corporate I ended up getting a number to an internet company on the west coast. I had to call back to the hotel the next day to speak to someone who would give me the actual number to corporate. When I called and told them what happened they informed me that they do not have a rule that states that. They agreed that its impolite to tell someone that can not take a picture in a hotel lobby. You are supposed to treat your guest like guest. Later on I ended up speaking to Megan who is the General Manager and informed her about what happened and to inform her that I was unable to reach her before because the front desk manager Adonas refused to give me her contact information. She told me that they are a franchise and they do have a rule about taking pictures in the lobby for some reason. I asked her to email me the rule and I waited 7 days in vain. Till this day I still have not seen that rule. The contract that I was given for my event before stated that I was only paying 800 from 12 5. After the incident and me calling corporate and having my attorney call them my event remained to be 80 but I was going to have to pay 25 per table in the room. What I have learned from this experience is do not spend your money where you are not appreciated and always keep a record of things. It is totally unreal to spend that much money in a hotel that does not appreciate you. If you are going to pay 80 to host an event at a hotel that should be permission alone to take a pic in a social area such as the hotel lobby. If I had walked into a private area of that hotel that would be a different story. But taking a picture in a hotel lobby. When has that ever been a rule. What puts the icing on the cake is not just the rule its the fact that the front desk manager Adonas is sitting in the bar area shouting from there to the lobby about taking pictures. He did not care if he embarrassed the guest did not ask who the guest was and did not give the guest the general managers business card. If that is the type of manager you have working at the front desk what does that say about the rest of the staff. Bridget was the only professional and courteous staff member that I met there.
