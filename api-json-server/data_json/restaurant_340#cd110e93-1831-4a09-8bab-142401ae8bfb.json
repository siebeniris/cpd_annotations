This Grand Old Lady has been on my bucket list for as long as I can remember and comes with a a huge reputation to live up to. Checking in for our four night stay went smoothly once it was sorted out that we were guests rather than tourists arriving for a look. We were seated in chairs in the lobby while all of the paperwork was signed. Unfortunately our Courtyard View Suite was not quite ready so headed out for a couple of hours. When we arrived back we were introduced to our two butlers who showed us to our Suite and explained the room. The room is in three parts firstly a lounge sitting area with a couch BOSE stereo small dining table and a flat screen TV hidden behind a mirror. The next room is the bedroom with a four poster bed another TV feather pillows and a pillow menu where most options are not available and finally the bathroom which is large has a separate shower and bath and double basins. The rooms have both air conditioning and ceiling fans. Outside on the balcony are two balcony chairs and a small table and not a courtyard or view of one insight. We learned fairly quickly that The Grand Old Lady is rather discerning. She prefers the company of guests that are formally dressed as opposed to those that are dressed like tourists and is more friendly to those who she can refer to as Professor or Doctor. She is all a bit uptight so guests like ourselves who like to be a bit more casual on our holidays just serve to make her even more uptight. The Grand Old Lady puts on a pretty good breakfast menu which was included with our room. The Fawlty Towers style service is below what you would expect from This Old Lady but the food is good with a large buffet and a menu to order cooked items. If you have the option to upgrade your room to include breakfast i would recommend you take the opportunity. For the pair of us it was cheaper to eat in the hotel for breakfast than eat out Singapore is an expensive city for food and outrageous for drinks. Pretty awesome place to wander around and take pictures although if you are not dressed right you are constantly reminded that this is a hotel guest only area. sir or you are constantly asked may i have your suite number. sir The Long Bar was busy the night we visited but is kind of a thing you have to do when you are in Singapore. The staff were pretty standoffish until they discovered we were staying in house and only then were we shown to a table. We downed two Slings each which cost a shade under 30 each No one said The Grand Old Lady was cheap before heading to the Billiard Room Bar which was a lot quieter great service and more affordable. The rooftop pool is intimate and quiet and has a full bar service with complementary waters. All in all we enjoyed ourselves the service apart from our two fabulous butlers was not quite up to what you would expect and it is all a bit stuffy kind of like staying at Grandmas. If you spend your holidays in a suit this place will probably be perfect for you but regardless you have to do it once to tick the box and probably two nights would have been plenty.", "offset": [1600, 1756], "date": "2015-09-05 00:00:00", "cpt": "0", "category": "restaurant"}, {"id": 4, "uid": "049a8c9c-617e-47fc-8b16-e7e0538841bf", "sentence": "Raffles a must if you are ever in Singapore.

We stayed here in September 2017 when the renovations where in full swing. Having booked it the impression I got was that Phase 1 would be completed and open by the time we went.

We stayed in Raffles back in 2015 and apart from parts being closed there was no discernible difference in what was on offer. A fabulous welcome on arrival and then shown to the East India Rooms where the reception was located at the time. No queueing but your are taken to a table and chairs and they come to you. A number of managers coming up and welcoming us to the hotel almost to the point of slight embarrassment but can not in any way knock it.

Due to the Long Bar being closed he main centre of attention was the Billiard Bar. They had kept the peanut tradition from the Long Bar so it kept some of the Long Bar atmosphere. It is the case that the prices in this hotel will not suite all budgets. Some people just come and walk round take photographs and leave that is fine if it is all you want to do.
