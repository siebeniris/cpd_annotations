The location was great and the facilities were fine for what we paid for and what the hotel was rated as. The staff could have been a bit warmer in their interactions with guests.

The hotel was in a great location. Close to everything. It was near the train station Etihad stadium and close to shopping. about 8 10 minutes walk. The hotel rooms were fantastic and spaces and very clean. Felt very comfortable. A blond lady was so very nice and welcoming and lovely and so helpful. The ONLY complaint I would make is two staff receptionist were very rude in the way they spoke to us. We asked them about what they would recommend to us about things to visit in Melbourne as we were not from Melbourne and they looked and responded to us in a quiet rude manner. Maybe they were having a bad day I am not sure. But that is the only complaint I have. Which is only a minor one. I have stayed at ALOT of hotels and all were happy to suggest places to visit. Except for these two ladies.

The swimming pool. We had first checked into the hotel room and had asked for a cot to be provided upon searching the room we found there were no spare blankets sheets or pillows. There were two towels in the room which were not enough for a swim and a shower upon returning to our room. Later that night we had ordered room service. Upon searching for cutlery there was only one fork and one knife provided. we were asked by the room service team to leave our plates outside our door. We were up at 7 am the next morning for a swim and the dishes were yet to be collected I left the room again at 11 am to see that the room service plates had still not been collected which was absolutely disgusting to look at I felt as though the other occupants thought it was disgusting and that we were being judged by them. I was extremely hesitant to call the front desk as I had call a few times prior and was made to feel as if I was a nuisance. The high chairs are also extremely out dated and in appealing condition.

Very insecure room charging system. I liked location of the hotel. It was walking distance of city attractions shopping malls Yara river etc. The view from the room was stunning. Breakfast was also very good. The staff. When I was checking in the girl that was working that day embarrassed me telling me that my credit card is not credit card and that they can not accept it because it is refused. She tried several times to use my credit card but she was confused and it seemed that she did not know how to use the POS machine. She was persistence telling me that my card is refused and that I should give the hotel my family members card number so that they can charge for their card my family was 18 0 km away. While she was doing that to me the line of the waiting guests was behind me. In the end I told her that I want to speak with the manager because my credit card was CREDIT card I showed her my booking confirmation I booked the hotel with the very same card. Finally she tried to write my card numbers manually and it finally worked. She did not even apologize. Very rude and very unprofesionalAlso when I was checking out I was in hurry taxi was waiting from me outside and I was waiting 15 minutes for someone to serve me on the reception. They told me there were some extra charges on my room number and that I had a drink in a bar on the second day of my stay. They wanted to charge me 30. The truth is that I was never in the hotel bar and I was never ordering anything from the bar in my room. I think the reason for that is very insecure system in the hotel where is enough to say your room number for everything but they do not actually require you showing them proof of your room number. I guess someone had a drinks in hotel bar and told my room number for charging. I still do not know if hotel is going to charge me for that but if they do I am going to sue them and request for security camera video tape of the day when I was apparently in the bar having drinks. The elevators are very slow and do not like the fact that hotel room cleaners are using guests lift.
