I have been staying here for a recovery holiday following the loss of my late wife last year. It has been a great tonic. My travelling companion and I have been treated to the best service possible from a dedicated staff who really do make this hotel one of the best in Barbados. Our room looked out to the sea and we were treated to wonderful sunsets each evening. We had a top floor room with a balcony and it was well equipped and a reasonable size. It had iPod player and flat screen tv with a large choice of channels including BC America. The pool and jacuzi are fabulously warm as is the sea. The afternoon tea is complimentary and many watersports are also offered free we chose a paddle board but other things including a small boat are available to guests. When sunbathing a member of staff is on hand to offer refreshments and a pleasant strawberry smoothie was offered at no charge. I stayed at the neighbouring Glitter Bay hotel 11 years ago and it was part of the same complex today the two buildings are separate. This building has not changed much and might need a refit in due course but it is in excellent condition the gardens are exemplary and the service really does make a visit worthwhile.

A little lacking in atmosphere particularly in the evening. My wife and I very much enjoyed our first visit to Barbados 1 8 March 2018 and the location of this hotel and the lovely room one of the Beachfront Junior Suites were key contributors to that. In addition most of the staff we encountered were very friendly and welcoming. Breakfasts were great good quality food plenty of choice good service and a nice relaxed atmosphere. However we were on a half board basis and we were extremely disappointed with the offering in the Taboras restaurant in the evening. The menu choice was very limited and the restaurant was virtually deserted and hence lacking in atmosphere. Maybe a more extensive menu would have tempted more clients which in turn would improve the atmosphere. We had two evening meals in the Palm Terrace restaurant both of which were of good quality. the buffet offering on the evening of the Managers cocktail party was surprisingly good but again we felt the restaurant lacked real atmosphere. The tables were spaced quite far a part and it was fairly sparsely occupied on both occasions. We chose to eat out on the other evenings of our stay and so effectively lost the benefit of our half board package. After dinner there was nothing happening in the hotel and the bar area was completely dead. We stayed at the bar with 2 other couples until about midnight one evening the night of the Managers cocktail party and we were literally the only guests there. Some form of music or entertainment might have encouraged a little more activity around the bar during the late evening. A big disappointment for us was the non event of having our own butler. We were looking forward to this experience and from what we had seen and heard of butlers at other hotels around the world expected it to add an extra level of enjoyment to our holiday. We met the lovely Curtis on check in. He showed us to our room and he told us he would be looking after us during our stay but it was two full days before we saw him again and then only fletingly as he was passing our seats by the pool. I did not expect or wish to be waited on hand and foot but it would at least have been nice had he checked with us once a day to see I there was anything he could do. In the end when I did need something I had to send a message via another butler and even then he did not respond until the following day. You make a big thing of the butler service as part of the offering in your Beachfront Junior Suites. Based on our experience it is service that added little or no value. I can not believe that is your intention. Curtis was not even in evidence when we came to check out. The General Manager Tom very pleasant and appeared receptive to our brief comments about the food offering we said that we would not opt for half board if we were to return to the hotel. We were also very grateful for the speedy and unfusy way in which he responded to our request for a late check out thank you. The setting of the hotel is wonderful and the maintenance of the grounds and the standard of our room was first class. The personalised toiletries were a nice touch. The staff were generally very friendly. Sorry I can not remember names but all the Concierge team were helpful as were most of the Reception staff and all the restaurant staff waiters and managers were always very welcoming. Housekeeping was also at a high standard and the pool guys and beach attendants were friendly and helpful. The wi fi was as good as any I have known in any hotel and the complimentary Press Reader service was appreciated and worked well. Unfortunately due to the prevailing sea conditions for the majority of our stay we did not have an opportunity to enjoy any of the water sports offered by the Beach Club. We would love to return to Barbados and would seriously consider a return to the Royal Pavilion possibly bringing our adult kids ages 19 22 24 but we would have a concern about the evening food options and particularly the lack of any entertainment and hence atmosphere in the bar area in the evening.", "offset": [3024, 3142], "date": "2018-03-14 11:52:24", "cpt": "1", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 11, "uid": "c40719ab-cbf1-465d-9d64-9c5dc9c24ebc", "sentence": "Beachfront location \u2014 will return. This recently refurbished hotel enjoys an excellent location and gracious staff. It is a mid size hotel small enough so that the staff will know your name but large enough to offer several amenities.

CONs Restaurant offerings need to be upgraded with more variety. The menu does not vary and not many guests want to eat three meals per day in the same location.

Stayed many times over the years but the Fairmont has never known its market well enough. Yes the location is stunning rooms are nice but not as sensational as the marketing post refurb makes out and the majority of the staff are very friendly but this hotel is priced second only to sandy lane and there is no way it is the second best hotel on island. I love the beach the food has drastically improved since Kirk took over and the pool is nice. There are major changes needed though a 5 star should not have 1 restaurant the other one hardly opens and as much as I applaud the decision to allow children all year round from December where is the prevision for anyone bringing children to the resort. It is 1 month from being family friendly and there is no kids club no kids pool no child centric activities and no nanny or babysitting service so parents can have a meal or swim alone. Without this it is irrelevant if they let children in or not as families will choose better equipt luxury resorts which are all over Barbados. It is also only partly refurbished the villa has new rooms but old bathroom suites facilities like the restaurant have not been changed and we even had a ripped chair at breakfast. The Tennis court is so cracked and dirty it could not really be used not to mention a shop that is so small old and overpriced it is pointless being there and a hair salon that looks like it has had no investment since the 1980s. This is not a five star hotel in truth even though some exceptional staff and the beautiful location make the guest experience nice despite the faults. It is the only 5 star on the island not sold out over the peak Christmas season because it charges over \u00a3 200 A NIGHT. based on all I have mentioned above you would have to be a fool to spend this on a room here. The hotel has never recovered from loosing Tim Morrison as manager and needs much more investment and care.

We were excited to be staying in supposedly one of the best hotels in Barbados and the reviews on TripAdvisor were generally very positive.

Elegant lobby in keeping with the local design with rooms tastefully furnished and renovated. all with amazing sea views. 2. Beach is beautiful and water clean. Sun loungers are comfortable and beach service is available3. Return airport transfers by luxury car are included in most room rates but see below4. Afternoon tea was complimentary for one night of the stay and quite tasty5. Food in the restaurant is of a reasonable standard and fairly pricedNEGATIVES1. Emails to the hotels advertised web address to advise of our arrival and departure details failed to receive answers for more than 2 days2. Despite requesting an early check in as a benefit of both Platinum status in Le Club Acor and FHR the hotel denied receiving this request and we had to wait an hour for the room to be made available3. Once we arrived at the room despite booking a beachfront suite we found we had been downgraded to an oceanfront room. Initially the front desk staff tried to pretend the room was indeed what we had booked. Eventually they agreed it was a downgrade. It was lovely but definitely not the suite we had booked. We never received an explanation for the downgrade and can only imagine the hotel had overboked. They did agree to reduce the room rate to that of the room rather than suite but that is a minor consolation for the downgrade and the least we would have expected. On this point we have still not received the refund for the rate difference between the pre paid oceanfront suite and the oceanfront rom4. The minibars in the renovated rooms are not working. Instead there is a letter stating that items may be ordered through room service with a supplemental delivery charge5. We received a letter advising of the services of our butler to include packing unpacking complimentary pressing ice wake up with tea coffee as well as evening canap\u00e9s served in the room after 530pm. We never saw our butler during the stay and equally never received any of the advertised butler offerings. Equally we did not receive the promised bespoke amenities including the beach bag etc 6. We had pre booked the hotel car to take us to the airport the morning of our departure and reconfirmed this the night before. However the car did not turn up for our transfer. When the front desk called to find out what had happened the taxi was at the airport waiting for us. The hotel had booked our transfer FROM the airport instead of TO the airport despite knowing we were in house guests. In the end they booked us a regular minibus which was far from the standard of the luxury car we had booked and was included in our rate. To date we have received no apologies from the hotel either for the involuntary downgrade to a room lack of early check in being set up lack of butler services nor the mishap over our transport to the airport. Additionally we have not received the promised refund for the price differential between suite and room. The hard product since the renovation is very nice but unfortunately let down by a lack of good customer service. Staff smiled and appeared outwardly friendly but that is where it ended and certainly there was not the proactive service you expect in a Fairmont or any other 4 or 5 star hotel charging greater than a 1000 per night. How do you maker sense of the disconnect between reviews of the hotel some give it huge praise and 5 stars. Others like myself encountered major customer service failings. Part of it may be cultural in the sense that the Caribbean way of life is laid back but that should not result in staff being less attentive or slap dash. I think if you luck out and everything goes clockwork with the stay you will really enjoy yourself. But if mistakes are made by the hotel do not expect them to admit to it or apologize and they do not seem to know the concept of service retrieval in the same way North American properties do. If you decide to stay here I suggest you double check everything before you arrive including room type services to be expected and ground transfers. However to be safe I would suggest you consider other options on the Island until the hotel management can get the customer service aspect of the the hotel up to 5 star standards.", "offset": [346, 439], "date": "2019-04-02 00:00:00", "cpt": "1", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 17, "uid": "ca4fc650-5dd3-413c-aa0b-f90d72e26a9d", "sentence": "Great location let down by the food.
