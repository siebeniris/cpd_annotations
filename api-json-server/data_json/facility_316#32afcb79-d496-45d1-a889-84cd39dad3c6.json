Polished floors pristine presentation amazingly friendly check in staff. We arrived from New Zealand just before midnight from a 9 hour flight and were shattered. We were travelling with another couple and we were all very tired. There did seem to be some issue with other guests and the few check in staff which were available at that time did seem to be involved with sorting some issue out with other clients. We eventually got seen to and the lady who checked us in was very lovely and kind and apologetic about our wait. The other couple who were with us had to be put in a temporary room until their previously booked room became available 2 nights later. To the Cosmopolitans credit our friends did get an upgrade to compensate for being temporarily disadvantaged. I noticed that many of the other guests were within the 20 30 year age group and there were quite a few Hens and Stags staying. My impressions was that this hotel is favoured by the young and hip so may not be as suitable for families. There is plenty of shopping located close by with the Miracle Mile Malls and plenty of restaurants and bars to choose from also. I would recommend this hotel for those with disposable income and who are couples or young and single not so much for families though. I would nt recommend this for families as it is not the cheapest place to stay and I do nt believe that it is entirely family friendly there are no laundry facilities for guests and I did nt notice that there were any restaurants or location based facilities which catered for families. The Wicked Spoon Restaurant was a buffet style place to eat with absolutely everything you could want to eat but was quite pricey in my opinion. In our room I did notice that there was dust on the bedside lights and also on the skirting boards. We stayed 6 nights and the only time that our room was vacuumed was on the day we were due to leave.", "offset": [1332, 1618], "date": "2015-06-15", "cpt": "0", "category": "facility"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "d0b492d8-2b06-4e99-bd02-c0ab1b963290", "sentence": "Beautiful hotel amazing service. I can not rave enough about this wonderful hotel. We were there for a long weekend mid July with 4 girlfriends and it was an absolutely amazing time. We stayed in the West Tower which is very convenient and close to the entrance and the taxi entrance. it is not like MGM where you feel like you are walking a mile to get anywhere but it is still large enough that the hotel has many amenities. There is 24 hour room service for quite a reasonable price for Vegas standards lol like a medium pizza at 40 am was only 25 with the tip and room service feThe nightclub in the Cosmo is very nice and their pool party is also a good one. They have two normal pools as well if you just want to sun tan and have a drinkThe restaurants inside this hotel are very good we tried the Henry which is classic American food great for breakfast. it is open 24 hours too. The casino is nice but does not overtake this place either. The decor is GORGEOUS you will love this place trust me.

I went to Vegas to partake in a Show Competition and the Cosmopolitan was the host hotel. My experience at the Cosmopolitan and the treatment I received from the staff and front desk was the worst customer service I have ever seen to date. When I originally booked the room months in advance I requested a nonsmoking floor and refrigerator and followed up with phone calls and emails to confirm these specific requests and was ensured that everything was all set. When I arrived at the hotel the room had no refrigerator besides the mini bar and I was told that I would be charged a 250 fee to remove the contents from the mini bar for use as my refrigerator. They told me there were no refrigerators left and that to me is unacceptable after I specifically requested and followed up multiple times regarding this issue. The person I traveled with is a diabetic and needed to keep medication and food cold which I indicated on the request form when booking the room. When someone finally did come to remove the mini bar contents it was over an hour later and I had to purchase a bag of ice to keep the food we had to bring cold so that it did not spoil. I was told I would need to pay 20 per day to use the Wifi in the hotel and there were many times when the wifi would not even connect. On my floor there were hotel guests smoking marijuana and running up and down the halls screaming. And although I understand that the hotel can not control the guests I thought that since there were people there for business in particular the show that we would be kept together so that we were not surrounded by the guests looking to party. The night prior to my competition I could not sleep due to the disruptive guests and alarms going off throughout the building. I called on Saturday to speak to the front desk about my experience in hopes that I could be moved to another floor AFTER my show day and they said I could. I went to the desk later that afternoon and the front desk employee basically told me that I could check out at 11 AM the next day and move to another hotel. Coming with such a large group I was hoping that we would receive much better treatment than being told that I could leave if I did not like it. I spoke with the front desk manager and told her about my experience. I expressed that I have traveled to many different hotels and have never received such poor service. Since I did not change rooms I asked about being compensated for the three days of Internet use totaling 600 and she said that she would take care of it for me and that I would not be charged. I think that was a very minimal request for the disrespect and inconsideration that I received throughout my stay. When I checked out in the morning I was told that she was not able to comp the Internet and the best she could do is give me 300 off one day of the room price. I know multiple guests that had a very similar experience and expressed their concerns to the front desk and received over 100 off their internet bill. So to be told that it was all set and then find out that she could not do anything for me that was very disappointing and unprofessional. I was trying to not be an inconvenience to the hotel and decided to stay in the room I was in and only asked for a reimbursement of the Internet charges. The rooms were filthy. They did not clean the floor or shower ONCE during my stay. There were soap marks on the shower floor that were there from the first day there and remained the entire time. They never cleaned the bowl or tea kettle that I requested on my first day. There were remnants on the floor that were never picked up. From this experience I will warn you that if you expect high quality service a clean room and professionalism DO NOT STAY HERE. I have never had such an awful experience and for being a guest with a large group of people I was hoping to receive much better service than I did. They basically said to me we get 120 people in and out every morning in other words you are just another 1 of those 120.", "offset": [1341, 1439], "date": "2015-08-31", "cpt": "0", "category": "facility"}, {"id": 3, "uid": "438b336b-08d3-402d-ba7d-14296cd7a474", "sentence": "Avoid at all costs. I had high expectations but having stayed at the Cosmopolitan I am thoroughly disappointed for a number of reasons1. The rooms are filthy with stains on carpets chairs and sofas. For a hotel of this calibre this is unaceptable2. Poor maintenance while this hotel is one of the newest on the Strip the decor and building seemed to have aged a lot. All walls are scuffed doors are sqeaky balcony locks are not working public areas are filthy etc3. General lack of customer service. after having requested housekeeping for some matches four times I still have not received them4. Lifts. Lifts are always full and slow so it takes ages to go down to the loby5. Guest attire. While all hotels on the Strip have pools guests are not permitted to roam in swimwear in the lobby and public areas. This is clearly not the case at the Cosmopolitan. Therefore this hotel is clearly not suitable for families with children6. Lack of security. Unlike the other hotel in Las Vegas there is no security to check room keys allowing anyone to come up to the rooms. Particularly in Las Vegas security is an essential requirementAl in all the Aria or the Belagio are clearly better options to stay in.

My wife and I checked into The Cosmopolitan for 3 nights to celebrate our anniversary. I can honestly say that this is one of the best experiences anyone can have if they want a perfect combination of amazing accommodations a great casino fantastic restaurants and a central location on the strip for those looking to party. We had the pleasure of enjoying a terrace one bedroom up on the 47th floor facing to the Belagio fountains. The suite was very clean and spacious including a microwave dishwasher why sofa bed with linens along with a double bathtub you could see the strip from. Just know there is no coffee maker in the room. The view is breathtaking both day and night from the balcony which you can smoke on if you do. Like I said request or book fountain viewTake a few moments to study your property map but the easiest way to think of it is that the West and East towers are connected via the 1st floor casino and lobby and 2nd floor restaurants and shops. Also be sure to ask what pools are open because of private events and time of year off season. For dining we enjoyed Jaleo Spanish Tapas and paella Scarpeta Italian Wicked Spoon buffet and Holsteins Burgers and Spiked Milkshakes. They were all fantastic but be prepared for a loud dining experience if you head to Jaleo as it is very lively. it is wonderful and be prepared to share. For Scarpeta I would try to ask for a table viewing the Belagio fountains. This is a very intimate classy establishment. You must save room for a spiked milkshake at Holsteins. Holy cow Wicked Spoon was unreal. We went for brunch and was very impressed. it is neck and neck with Bacchanal at Cesars Palace went last year. Every Cosmo restaurant is ranked in the top 250 out of 450 restaurants in Vegas so you had have to have a real issue to not enjoy what they offer. The staff was excellent minus some less enthusiastic individuals when you compared them to the other 95 off staff members you encounter. The Front Desk is always busy so do not expect to share your life story with them to chat nor vise versa. Shout outs go to Candace concierge helped us plan a trip to Red Rocks. Andrew concierge got us into Javiers at Aria and Wilie co star who helped walk us not just point us to locations in the resort he was awesome to get to know. The concierge staff is very organized in their follow up and cared about us so much it was amazing. This is such a hip property I figure it is best for those who are outgoing lively and looking for adventure. I could not imagine staying here if I am just looking for a quiet and classy joint. This place is classy but far from being uptight or snobby. Be prepared to be amazed.

The room is set way back through a long hallway from the front door which is great because we did not hear another soul while in our room. Great second bathroom with huge shower full kitchen living and very very comfortable beds in the master suite. Tons of storage. If you can stay in the East Tower instead of the West it is a longer hike when you first check in but for the rest of the stay it is exactly where you want to be. Close to restaurants and the strip. You can almost walk off the elevator down a hall past some shops and you are on the Las Vegas strip get off on the 2nd floor so you can use glass walkways to head across to Miracle Mile shopping or to Crystals.

Lifts up to the room remember to get on the right one as each one miss out certain floors to avoid stopping at each floor. The apartment was lovely on the 47th floor. Overlooking the strip Belagio fountains. Note there are no tea coffee facilities in the room just a mini bar with the usual goodies high prices. The sofa bed sadly did not live up to the rest of the apartment. Housekeeping came to make it up as requested but it consisted of 1 pillow a sheet. Not very comfortable at all. There is a master light control by the door which turned allele the lights off which plunged you into darkness meant fumbling your way to the first available lamp to switch it on before going round the individual lights you wanted to keep on. Location wise its great. Its right in the middle of the strip with a pedestrian bridge located on Level 2 which takes you to either the Miracle Mile Shops within Planet Hollywood or down into the street next to the Belagio.

Door handles have been over used and are dropping off the doors. Toilet roll holders and shower heads are hanging on by a thread. The shower head really should be a rain forest one and not some spout coming out the wall that trickles water on you. Room service was terrible and numerous days they did not even come and clean our room despite us calling them to tell them we were leaving and would like it cleaned.
