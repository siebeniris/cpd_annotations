This is my second visit to the Hyat Hunington Beach. It is a great hotel and like most Hyat Resorts is very luxurious. Here are some tips for staying there The place was very dog friendly. I have never seen so many dogs with people and there are places where dogs can take a break along with bags to clean up after them. If you do not have a gazillion dollars then there is a Walmart about three blocks from the hotel and the rooms have a fridge. We picked up fruit snacks and wine and enjoyed them in our room. You can rent a car for a day for about 55 dollars right from the Concierge. However you can not really keep it overnight since parking is 35 for the rental car you just spent 55 on. However it is super easy just to rent there and drop off there. The drive down highway 1 is very nice and there are some great places to stop at. The little cafe right by the conference halls has Starbucks and bagels. There is a 24 hour fitness center that has everything you need to workout. I thought the coffee in the rooms was horrible. Not sure why but I just did not like it. I brought my own Kurig pods and there is a Kurig machine in the room. For three dollars you can get a shuttle to the downtown Hunington area. It is only about a mile away but sometimes taking the shuttle is easier. You just buy a ticket from the concierge. There are a bunch of restaurants and stores there. However there seems to be a lot of bars so I did not really like it at night. If you are Catholic there is a very quaint church about 14 miles from the hotel. It you take the shuttle to the Main Street then it is only 4 miles. It is called St Marys by the Sea. Overall a great hotel with a lot to do even for kids. There is a special pool for kids with slides a special hotub grotto for adults and a general pool for everyone.", "offset": [1732, 1843], "date": "2015-09-15", "cpt": "0", "category": "pool"}, {"id": 3, "uid": "8d450de4-d12e-4840-94b4-67f813850a52", "sentence": "Hyat Regency Huntingdon Beach.

Otherwise a nice expensive hotel. First impressions are probably the most important thing when staying at a hotel. My family and I were excited about our stay at the Hyat Regency Huntington Beach and the excitement grew when I was sent an e mail a few days before check in to upgrade to an ocean view for 25 a night. I quickly claimed the offer and told my family about it they were so excited. A day later I was e mailed a just kidding about that upgrade message and told that none were available. Too bad so sad for me. I was ok with it but it was hard to tell my family who came from Florida to visit. Their disappointed looks still haunt me. Otherwise the Hyat Regency Huntington Beach is a lovely property in a beautiful seaside town. The landscaping is gorgeous and there is plenty of room to walk around the sprawling property. The fees begin the second you roll up to the front 36 a night for valet parking plus tax of course. Check. in was easy and friendly. 28 a night resort fee that included a couple bottles of water and beach towels chairs. Nothing much else of value seem to be offered with the fee but that is just my opinion. We were given a room on the first floor. It certainly was not Oceanfront but if you stood on the ledge you could see the water. The first floor room was sunken a bit beneath the grounds so it felt like we were a bit underground. There were plants in front of us but no grass to walk out to and enjoy. It was a disappointment but manageable. The room itself was fine the fridge was appreciated. The decor is becoming a bit long in the tooth and needs to be refreshed soon. I am sure this hotel takes a lot of abuse with all of the families visiting. Time for some upgrades. The bathroom was fine but you could not lock the sliding door for it. The shower was either scalding or not hot. It was hard to find the appropriate balance. Housekeeping was nice enough to bring a curling iron and extra coffee wine cups. You do not come to a hotel like this to sit in the room. There was plenty to do on the property. whether chilling by one of the many pools or going to the beach. The chair towel service was great and made the 28 resort fee a little less painful. Beach towels have to be signed out and a slip returned detracting from the luxury feel of the hotel but understandable given the number of people who could crash the pool and other facilities. This hotel is wall to wall families so if that is your crowd you will love it. There was a separate kids pool area that I stayed far away from but I am sure it was fun for kids. There was an adult hot tub grotto area that was really nice. Of course kids came there too but it is impossible to escape kids at a resort like this. Dining on site was actually pretty reasonable. The pizza place had good pizza and they deliver to your room. there is a buffet on Saturday and Sunday nights at one of the restaurants. The food was pretty good and the price was not ridiculous. There is a shuttle that will take you to Huntington Beach for 3 per person. You would think something like that would be included in the resort fee. We decided to walk instead and it was pleasant. Overall I liked the hotel and my family had a good time. First impressions were poor and the feeling of being nickeled and dimed to the tune of 75 a day for parking resort fees detracts from the enjoyment.

Overall not a bad stay and valet staff in particularly very friendly and on top of things. Here \u2019s a few problems1. Main Pool and Spa out of Service. If I had known about this issue prior to booking and arriving I would have picked a different hotel there are two comparables ones right next door and a third comparable that does not have a pool but suddenly looking very appealing. The hotel was about 95 empty no one offered to upgrade a room or anything to compensate for this serious disappointment. In fact there was a 25 per day resort fee that the hotel only offered to remove when I complained about this upon departure. why was this on the bill in the first place given unavailable pool and spa status to be fair there is a kidie style second rate pool in the back that was open2. Maid service. The bathtub was not draining properly and had to get this fixed a good housekeeping service would keep track of these types of problems assuming they are cleaning the bathtub daily. After first night the garbage was not taken out of the room and the ice bucket was still full of icy water and no replacement plastic liner3. Rooms are okay but need renovation. Water pressure for shower is good but barely drip drip for the regular bathroom sink4. Bed is comfortable4. Very quiet even though some work was being done upstairs for at least part of our stay. On plus side1. Staff is very pleasant and helpful2. Access to beach is good even though compound is extensive. Having a land bridge to access the beach is good. Beach chairs need to be replaced. but the newer updated Tomy Bahama ones which are better and lighter and have the rails facing away from you so when trekking with them back from the beach the sand is n\u2019t directly touching your lower back rear3. No pool and spa no upgrade offer despite something like 5 occupancy rate this past week and having to for removing resort fee is unacceptable for a high end hotel that is trying to present itself as first rate hospitality. Not real \u201c fresh squeezed \u201d orange juice for a meal that taps out to 35 p for breakfast at their mainstay restaurant is also not acceptable and you feel a bit scamed.

I visited the Hyat Regency Huntington Beach Resort with my toddler and parents and everyone had such a wonderful time. The hotel is grown up but still kid friendly. My two year old LOVED the kid pools and water slides. I liked that the adult pool and spa grotto were in completely separate areas from the kid focused pools so the kids could run free without bothering people looking for a quieter weekend. There are three water slides in the kid area two bigger slides for kids 48 inches and up and one that kids under 48 inches can go on. My two year old is about 36 inches tall and I was happy that the pool rules allowed her to ride the little slide with a parent or water wings. The water slides were open from 10a6p during our late September stay and there was always a lifeguard present watching the kids go down the slides and measuring to make sure they were tall enough to ride the big ones. My toddler also loved the 10a koi fish feeding which reminded me of another awesome Hyat stay we had at the Grand Hyat in Kauai. The service was amazing throughout our stay. We had a couple of times we needed help with unusual requests and both times the staff was extremely helpful and did not skip a beat in helping us figure out a solution. Michele in the Club Lounge was especially helpful thanks Michele. Side note I thought our Club Lounge rate was definitely worth it.
