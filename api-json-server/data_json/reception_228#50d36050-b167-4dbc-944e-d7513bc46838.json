I stayed in a Club Level room 2 floors down from the top. The room was very clean very well appointed albeit not very large. However the bathroom was just perfect. Giant tiled walk in shower with frameles glass doors and two shower heads one removable. Plus a separate tub and a very nice sink vanity. Having that beautiful giant shower to refresh in after walking around San Francisco was quite nice. The Concierge Lounge and high level view were absolutely worth spending the extra for the room. The breakfast in the morning itself was quite good better than many small hotels breakfast buffet. I ate there every morning which saved quite a bit from breakfast in the lobby restaurant. A couple different kinds of eggs several hot meats oatmeal cheeses yogurt coffee it was quite nice. Plus I made some new friends chatting with other folks staying there. This hotel is a little unusual in that there is not really much of a lobby area where people sit and work or have drinks socialize etc. it is small and the traffic through is so much that it is more of waiting area than a social lobby. If you enjoy that hotel lobby place to meet new people work etc then this will not be a good fit unles you have access to the concierge lounge. Location is decent for visiting the city but you will walk a little and use public transportation. Two short blocks like literally 5 minutes walk from Market 5th where you can catch any number of buses or streetcars. If you are going to a convention at Moscone it will be perfectly located. It was not cheap but no hotels in the city in SF are. Valet parking is hideously expensive though this is true of all hotels in the city. There is a public garage right behind the hotel at about half the nightly rate which is still pricey. Overall I loved the hotel though next time I might opt for a junior suite for a little more space though I will not want to give up access to the concierge lounge.", "offset": [0, 56], "date": "2015-04-22", "cpt": "0", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "7ae06077-2501-4186-8d1a-727a526f8000", "sentence": "Best hotel for giants fans.

Some of my favorite touches include the outdoor mezzanine off the indoor pool and fitness center the super comfy beds with GREAT views of San Francisco easy valet parking although expensive. in room USB charging wherever you look. The current population of homeless folks in San Francisco unfortunately tend to gather just past the block that the Intercontinental corners. For a seasoned city person this not might be much of a point you notice however for guests that are not accustomed to life in a big city it could be a bit up close and personal. The shampoo that the hotel provides is actually really good and it is one of the little things that make a big difference when traveling for business as frequently as I do. The staff is always great and the front desk operates as any front desk at a four star major brand name hotel should. During one of my stays the phone system was down for some reason or another and I unfortunately had to wait over an hour for a simple housekeeping request. Service is consistently good as expected with the price tags their rooms carry. My travel status with IHG has awarded me upgraded rooms on several occasions and I always enjoy taking in the views regardless of what side of the hotel I have been on.

I had to stay at the intercontinental for a business trip and decided to continue my stay at the intercontinental for a long weekend after to explore the city. While the location is great for business especially if you are visiting the convention center or any of the tech companies in the area I would not recommend this hotel for a personal trip. This was my first time visiting SF so I was not sure where to stay. I figured it would be like any metropolitan city easy transportation to all of the touristy sites. However I quickly realized that due to the hotels proximity to the Tenderloin neighborhood and Sixth Street the homeless problem made it unsafe to venture out at night and taking a car service at night was practically required. I am a female and was traveling alone but I have lived in NYC my entire life and never have felt as unsafe as I did walking around this neighborhood even during the day. The first night I got there. I asked the bellhop for the nearest convenience store and he suggested I wait till morning to leave the hotel as it would not be safe to walk to thankful for this bellhops honest advice. This review is not a reflection on the intercontinental hotel itself but rather the neighborhood. The hotel itself was great and what you would expect from an intercontinental. The check in staff were phenomenal and offered me an upgrade to a higher floor and late checkout. The bellhops were extremely helpful helping me with bags giving me directions etc. The rooms were clean and I loved the floor to ceiling windows offering panoramic views.
