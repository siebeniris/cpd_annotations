The hotel is within walking distance to fun neighborhoods and great restaurants. I felt safe walking at night with my daughter. Also close access to highways that took us to other areas of the city.

The good moderately priced hotel that is pet friendly. We brought our small pomchi with us and they had a small sign in the lobby saying his name. 13 overnight parking for hybrid owners so yay for being a Prius owner. Hotel room is small and clean. Nice decor etc. The bad the walls in the hotel room are super thin. I assume we had a small dog in the room next to us as well and it would not stop barking for 20 minutes straight. It sounded like the dog was in the room with us. I booked the hotel through Hotel Tonight and had called the hotel afterwards to tell them the reservation would be for one bed and with a pet. But when we arrived to our room it was a two bed room. I called the front desk and the gentleman on the phone told me that since I had booked on hotel tonight that they gave me what they had available. I had explained to him that I had called the hotel to tell them the details of the reservation but he told me again that we had booked through hotel tonight and that is why. The hotel eventually changed us to a one bed room but it was still an inconvenience especially since I called ahead to avoid this. The worst. The bed. I had a pretty terrible night of sleep on this uncomfortable bed. And to add insult to injury the windows of the room do not block out any noise whatsoever. There is construction going on on the street below during our stay and it started about 6 am in the morning. During the night you could hear every car and train passing by. I came here to relax but instead I am going to leave more cranky than before.

The hotel was nice but there were too many misunderstandings with the personnel in charge. They advertised 460 breakfast on Expedia but it was not offered at the hotel.

I had two rooms reserved under my name one for two nights and the other for one night. The people at the front desk could never figure this out and kept my guests out of their room a couple of times because their names were not on the reservation.

Came to San Diego as a birthday trip for my wife. Decided to book with The Bristol Hotel due to the overwhelmimg positive reviews i read online. It is true that valet parking is the only parking available which i was prepared for. What i was nt prepared for was the price 30 for overnight parking i was charged. When we checked in i signed a paper agreeing to pay 26 for parking but the following morning my bill was 34 for parking. The gentleman at the front desk explained that their parking prices had risen within the last few months. I asked to see the agreement i signed the day before and someone crossed out the original price and added the higher price AFTER i originally signed. Of course no one knew how this could have possibly happened. He offered to contact his manager to see what could be done but seeing as how that was at 4 am and we were checking out by 8 am i doubt anything would ve happened. Top that with an extremely small room and outdated bathroom. Tablet was a nice touch but did nt work after my initial check in. Fitness center treadmill elliptical and bike machine. For almost 200 for 1 night i expected more from a downtown hotel. My advice if you stay here snap a picture of the paperwork you sign so they do nt try to up the pricing after you walk away. It may have been just 6 for me but why take a chance. Also print new paperwork that reflects current pricing.

First a disclaimer I doubt my stay is typical and I was not going to say anything but I received an email from The Bristol asking for a review. Here goesStay was polite but somewhat ambivalent. The sink in my room was motion activated so there was no way to get hot water. Nobody at the front desk seemed to understand and the maintenance guy seemed to not care. I had to shave out of a mug with hot water from the tub. The thermostat was quirky and inconsistent. I would set it to 68 but wake up with it at 71 because of some weird glitch. There was constant banging and noise starting at 8 AM every day. Two of the days there was no water between 10 AM and 0330 PMThe TV was off to the side of the bed not in front of it like every other hotel room I have been in.

The bed was SO comfortable. I also liked how nice and big the TV was. Upon booking I reviewed all pictures of my room options and I had selected a Primo King which according to the website had a little couch coffee table and vanity. This was not the case once i got to my room. I walked in and it was a standard room with none of the above features that the website advertised. I called down to the front desk to let them know it was not what i had booked according to their website and they said it was a primo room and that the ones in the pictures are accessible rooms. I am NOT saying that the room or hotel stay was terrible however I paid extra for an upgraded room based on the pictures provided and it was not the room I received. Seems like false advertising to me. Point is if you want to ensure you get the room that you are looking at on the website i would suggest calling and getting verification before you press complete reservation. Also they did not do turn down service. We were gone all day and they came to the door at 530 pm asking if we wanted them to clean our room.
