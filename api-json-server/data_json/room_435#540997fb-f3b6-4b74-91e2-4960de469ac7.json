In fact I was trying to chose between 2 different spa vacation sites and the receptionist was so personable and helpful that she was the tipping point. From our ride from the airport to our last meal in the dining room our stay was perfect. The program advisor helped us decide which classes to take and told us about all of services that were offered. We loved every class we took every meal we ate and every lecture we attended. The only complaint I had was the food was too delicious and I ate too much. The integrated approach of treating body mind and spirit was truly effective. The positive energy and healing spirit that I felt everywhere in Canyon Ranch was truly a blessing. I can not wait to come back.

My name is Sally. I am from Carmel Indiana. I have visited the ranch in Tucson for five years. Canyon Ranch is totally amazing. As soon as I arrive at the Tucson Airport and grab my bags I feel like I am at my home away from home. There are drivers who wait at the end of the escalator holding up a sign with your name on it. That begins with my uncontrollable excitement. The drivers have cold water waiting for you in the van. They explain some of the sites along the way. When we turn on Rocklif Road and drive through the grand row of eucalyptus trees I know that my vacation is actually beginning. You are genuinely welcomed by familiar faces of staff members. You go to registration and receive your personal water bottle a Canyon Ranch shirt your room assignment and door keys. You never have to touch your luggage again. A staff member drives you to your room on a golf cart they make sure your luggage is put inside and then you are ready to start exploring the area. The rooms are absolutely wonderful. They are beautifully decorated and welcoming. The decor is a Southwestern motif warm and inviting. There is a TV but we never watch it. However you can listen to soothing music or see the activity schedule on the TV. I personally love the Tucson location. Canyon Ranch has many sculptures and fountains strategically placed around the Ranch to add to your viewing pleasure. It is fun to see if you can spot anything new from year to year. It is so peaceful and quiet. I appreciate the weather in Tucson and look forward to being comfortably warm all week. We spend all our time outdoors while there. Being surrounded by the mountains is spectacular. There are so many amenities at the Ranch that I can not begin to mention them all. But some of my favorite things at the Ranch are the Spa the healthy food being outdoors sitting by the fountains strolling the grounds meeting new people the piano player in the Main Dining room the new Spirtuality facility the Quiet Room in the Spa the laundry facility the availability of so many lectures exercise equipment the ponds with turtles and fish and the groundkeepers who keep everything so beautifully manicured.

I booked a 4night Canyon Ranch stay just before Christmas as a getaway with my young adult daughter during a time when they have a special students stay free with a full fare adult. My daughter is very into health and fitness so this was an ideal destination for her and a good opportunity for us to have a rare mother daughter trip.

I can not even to begin to scratch the surface of expressing my gratitude for the week we experienced at Canyon Ranch Tucson. We were blessed to be placed in our casita by the exceptional Reservations Department more specifically Justin Riordan. From the moment of our arrival at the airport until our departure we were treated with the utmost respect from the genuine staff members in all departments of Canyon Ranch. We took part in the Life Enhancement Program from May 15 through May 21st 2016. The casitas were breathtaking from the moment we walked it very clean with no detail left behind. We were also impressed with the available amenities offered beyond what is normally available. The dining options were perfect and varied from the dining room versus the Double U Cafe. An additional and entertaining option is the Lunch and Learns. We definitely recommend taking part in those. The week started with an orientation and inspiring chat with Mel Zuckerman the Founder of Canyon Ranch. What a way to begin. The fitness classes were top notch of course from the old school aerobics to the up to date high intensity workouts. The fitness facility is also up to date with a variety of cardio equipment and up to date weightlifting options. The variety of strength tools present is also very commendable resistance bands slam balls Ketlebels Movestrong etc. We loved the variety of instructors coming from various backgrounds and fortes as well. Megan who instructed DJ Dance Party was fabulous. She was motivating the combo was not too challenging or too basic and we had a blast. Mira taught all of the mind and body classes we attended. She is very knowledgable and we appreciated what she shared without overwhelming us. We also had a few services as part of the LEP. I want to give my commending words to Andres Valasquez the Registered Dietitian. He literally changed my life and this was my Ah ha. He expressed such care and concern for me when he just met me. I became emotional in the service and he was right there with me. The medical staff available on property was professional and spent more time with us than any other medical professional I have ever seen in my life. The Exercise Physiologist Steve Gratkins was exceptional as well. I have so many goals in regards to working out that I did not have any expectations going in to the appointment. He narrowed down my goals we set a plan and focused in on what I currently need to prioritize. My mom lost her sunglasses for a few a days and Margie from Guest Services let my mom borrow her sunglasses for the duration of our stay. Who does that. Canyon Ranch. The staff even offered to drive to a nearby Walgrens and pick my mom up another pair of sunglasses and any additional items we needed. Turns out everything was available at the ranch. You all have covered everything. EverythingJim Eastburn and all of the LEC staff were so welcoming encouraging and bright lights to run in to on property. Such generous individuals and always willing to assist in any way. Canyon Ranch is another world that must be experienced.

Either try to stick to your service allowance or be prepared to shell out big time when you leave. Will we return. Maybe. I thought I had found the place we could go every year for a reset and refresh. But I will keep an eye on reviews and see if current management somehow manages to find its way.

Third visit to The Ranch a gift to recoup and regenerate. Sadly the service was not the quality previously offered. In the spa staff were often unavailable or busy gossiping I was intrigued to hear details about a new male staff who looked like Omar Sharif. It was the same in the formal dining room where staff were flirting and giggling which downgraded the overall dining experience. A few spa service staff massage and salon beauty salon hair seemed downright distracted or unhappy. A salon staff kept me waiting ten plus minutes while she did her own hair in the mirror. I arrived on time and was kept waiting while she attended to her grooming. I have already received a response from management regarding thisFod was consistently great in the dining room but needs updating in the demo kitchen same recipes techniques from over a year ago. Wonderful really outstanding local venison and short rib in the cafe. But why why does the entire facility refuse to stock whole milk. A final bit of foodie feedback There are inventive new gluten sugar free recipes now available nowadays why is so little offered here. It seems like a missed opportunity. Activities and amenities at CR continue to be top rate the hiking personal exercise instruction cardio and HIT classes aerial yoga and Watsu all outstanding. The spiritual and metaphysical component is woven into services and treatments seamlesly. And The quiet. No cell phones in common areas greatly appreciated. CR Aesthetics is a bright new addition to The Ranch experience. The nurse Amy is kind and knowledgable. What a lovely setting to receive rejuvenation services with a girlfriend. All in all it was a nice stay I am assured by feedback from CR management that each of the issues above will be attended to.

I have been concerned my last several visits about actions taken by new management particularly around the lack of variety day to day in food so went to Canyon Ranch last week with some trepidation. While I wish they would go back to the 5 7day rotation of new menus the overall visit was so exceptional that I can once again recommend to others without hesitation. A couple of things stood out on this visit. The outdoor sports hiking staff has always been a differentiator for Canyon Ranch and that remains the case and if anything is better than ever. Since I was the only guest most days who wanted to do a more advanced hike the staff was very flexible and allowed me to choose the specific hike for that day and their recommendations were spot on. One thing people do not realize is that while in July it can be 100 degrees at the Ranch the more advanced hikes take place at 60 90 feet where the temperature can be 20 degrees cooler so while it may take 45 minutes to drive to the trail head the weather could not be finer. Mark Brooke Omar and Tony were all great guides and even better companions. A second thing that stood out this visit was that they have streamlined the check in process so it only takes 1 2 minutes. In the past they often seemed less organized and the last thing a guest wants to do when they arrive is to sit for 15 minutes getting checked in. As for the food while I still prefer the old days when the lunch and dinner menu changed at least 5 times during the week I will say that the quality of the food overall has improved in the past year and the dinner entrees on offer have lots of flavor and they allow good customization if a guest does not want it exactly as described. Finally management is in the process of refurbishing the rooms so that combined with the time of year meant the Ranch was not nearly at full capacity. I may be in the minority here but would be perfectly pleased they do not update a subset of the rooms and market them as classic at a reduced price. I can understand how some new guests may arrive expecting 5 star luxury accommodations and be willing to pay up for it but I also suspect there are others like me who think the rooms as they are today are just fine.", "offset": [2066, 2281], "date": "2019-07-08", "cpt": "1", "category": "room"}]}
