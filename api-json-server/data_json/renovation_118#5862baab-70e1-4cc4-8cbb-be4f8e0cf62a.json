I wanted to write this some time ago but we went to Thailand to stay at another boutique hotel and unfortunately when we arrived it was still under renovations and could not take us. That hotel manager said they booked us a 5star resort hotel and to our surprise and dismay we arrived at the Holiday Inn Phuket. I was not happy UNTIL we got in the lobby and we were COMPLETELY blown away by the d\u00e9cor size and courtesy of the staff. In the states the Holiday is somewhat on the low end good but low medium end but in Thailand it was definitely a 5star resort with amenities that were luxurious. I would definitely recommend this resort to all interested in a laid but but luxurious trip with beautiful beaches and upscale service. I can not wait to return.", "offset": [22, 204], "date": "2016-02-17 00:00:00", "cpt": "0", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "b70fe710-b830-4cdb-8e92-d4836bbdc8e6", "sentence": "Disappointed. I have been to this hotel 5 times and decided that this time I would upgrade to the Buskahorn wing what a disappointment. Firstly I will say you can not fault the cleanliness of the hotel pool areas the room was big and had a rain shower with a seat to sit on and was also clean. I also stayed at another hotel for 5 nights so I have this hotel to compare to as well. I stayed 5 nights with bfast included for the same as 1 night with bfast at the Holiday Inn On arrival the reception staff were not overly friendly did not offer refreshing drink or cold towel. The staff did not seem to know there own hotel policies regarding kids. I had to go to room and get there Hotel info book and take back to reception to show them there policy no apology. The reception is behind closed doors so you do not see any staff on entering hotel. I stayed 7 nights 58 128 and only twice did I see security at entrance of Buskahorn wing near pool no security at lift and no one upon entering hotel from back street. When I have stayed at Main wing they have security on every entrance and lift. The pool in Buskahorn has a swim up bar that was empty most of the time I am not sure if it was the wasps that never left you alone when drinking there or that there is no Happy hour and drinks are only cheap if you drink beer. Cocktails are around 950 AUD 56 outside hotel. I will say they have a great happy hour at The Bar in the main wing. I feel as the staff are not overly friendly and it was just a job. I did not ever get that feeling in the Main wing. The bfast is just OK nothing special I could not even get yogurt in a tub and when it is priced as high as it is this should be available not homemade yogurt in a bowl that is like runny soup it is priced at 19 AUD if brought for entire stay at once or 22 if brought individually at this hotel you must also ad on service tax etc. I am a IHG member so they give you a 15 discount on restaurants. We only had room service a couple of times nothing special. For 5 out the 7 days there was no phone lines so you could not even order room service. I was in invited to The Meeting with management were they talk with you about your stay. It did have some nice finger food and cocktails wine etc. I did speak with Manager about my concerns he just said oh OK and sorry about phones I stayed at HI in Bali last year and also had meeting with the Management team they showed up gave you one on one attention and had iPad taking notesI also hired a nanny for my daughter who was 12 she was looking forward to talking with her about Thai cultures etc and the nanny did not even understand basic English and sat on day bed the whole time and my daughter was unable to get any conversation out of her. again I will compare this to HI in Bali nanny well versed in English and taught my daughter heaps about Bali and also played games in romAlso this hotel does not have a airconditioned lounge where you could sit if needed for a late flight yes they do hold luggage and did give us a room for 30 mins to shower a family of 4. For the size of the hotel and the prices charged there should be a Lounge available. So what I am really trying to say is do not uograde to Buskahorn its not worth the money the Main wing is better. When I walked through the hotel staff did greet you in Main wing and seemed happier. The overall customer service in Buskahorn wing leaves a lot to be desired and in comparison to the HI in Bali. the whole hotel leaves a lot to be desired in terms of atmosphere customer service and going that extra mile. So will I return to the Holiday Inn for a 6th time unlikely.", "offset": [382, 575], "date": "2016-08-19", "cpt": "0", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 2, "uid": "5b393840-44c8-4ff3-8dea-9ba412f3f53f", "sentence": "Nice place. But more is required to keep us going back. Having again stopped over in Thailand following a business trip on the way back to Australia we opted for the Holiday Inn Resort in Patong over our our last two stays at the Bahn Thai. We stayed here several years back and again it was okay. My business colleague and I wanted a bit of downtime away from the many families that stay here so we booked 2 private villas away from the maddening crowd. Upon arrival check inn was fluent and as usual courteous in the always lovely Thai manner. We went to our rooms and they were very hot as they have not had a dummy key entered in the slide in holder to turn on the power. This is a constant frustration in hot climates. If they know your arriving and you have given an approximate time then cool it down an hour before your are scheduled to arrive. After cooling the room down we showered and and met at the foyer and went out for a few drinks and food. The place is generally good but showing it is age. Many things need repairing sealing etc but alas you look over those things. Great pool areas for families and couples with those of you who want a little more privacy and luxury encouraged to book a private villa room with swim up balcony as me and my friend did. Nice touches like fresh fruit daily and free mini bar daily but 2 beers for free no wine or spirits is hardly a free mini bar. Drinks are expensive. 20 Baht for cocktails which equates to about 850AUD not expensive in Australia but that is for Thailand but no problem we spent plenty regardless. We did not eat in the restaurants this trip but SAMS steak house was as per past visits for guests and the general public an amazing up market steak house for a gathering or intimate dinner and I hope it has not changed so if you get the chance book it. Steaks from Australia and service worthy of our top restaurants or it was 3 years backThe buffet breakfast is huge and again expensive for those who are not huge eaters. If you are then you will be happy. No option to just choose a toasted sandwich and coffee. it is a full buffet or nothing so if you go. Be hungry to get true value. The hotel is nicely placed to be close enough to Bangle road yet also far enough away to relax in peace. The beach is directly across the road and hiring of scooters is also directly opposite. Massages on the beach front are over priced and not as good as the back streets. In summary this is a price friendly and family friendly for guests looking for value and staying in town with nice layout of pools for adults and kids to relax. Those wanting intimacy or privacy should pay the extra and get a ground floor villa room with swim up balcony. The other thing this hotel needs to do is have an air conditioned check in check out room for guests to stay cool while waiting to check in and out as the reception is not air conditioned is extremely hot yet the staff seem not to notice the guests sweating and waving their hands like a fan to cool themselves.", "offset": [1009, 1084], "date": "2016-09-29", "cpt": "0", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 3, "uid": "dd5324c0-cde1-4d73-a068-1dff3a7430bb", "sentence": "Great location across the beach.
