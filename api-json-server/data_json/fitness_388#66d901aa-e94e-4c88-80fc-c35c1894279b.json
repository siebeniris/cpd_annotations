It prices itself pretty modestly to keep the old place ticking over and arrival at the main wing still makes you feel quite important given all the bowing and scraping. However the prices of the bars and restaurants have not adjusted to the new normal and still seem expensive. The concierge is first class and there are dozens of bell boys and girls on hand to assist with your every need. My greatest grip was that on arrival after a long flight from the UK I arrived to be told that although my room was ready they would only make it available if I paid for an extra day as check in time was not until 2 pm. This must be the only hotel of this standing in the world that would try this on and only after some remonstrating did the manager relent and let me into my room. My colleague was less persistent and she had to us the gym to take a shower a wholly inadequate solution in the circumstances.", "offset": [888, 1014], "date": "2015-02-05 00:00:00", "cpt": "0", "category": "fitness"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "d94463ef-a7b1-410d-8560-137f7495f714", "sentence": "Great Hotel.

In case you are wondering \u2026 that is a good thing extremely classic and picturesque. The first thing you will notice is the service. The staff at this hotel is incredible. You are literally treated like royalty the moment you step on the grounds. The concierge the bell staff the reception all go out of their way to accommodate you. My wife my daughter and I shared a double room. We requested an extra bed for an additional cost after hearing that the doubles were more like twins. However when we arrived we quickly found out that was not the case. This left my wife and I with a giant XL King sized bed the two doubles pushed together and my daughter with a double. This certainly speaks to the size of the room. Bathroom was a nice size with cool little features like a clothes line and a steam proof section of mirror. Of course like the majority of the bathrooms in Japan the toilet was equipped with the on seat bidet. I do not know why these are not common place in the US. Location wise the hotel is fairly ideal. it is in affluent Ropongi Hills. you will quickly see just how affluent when you see how many 100 K plus automobiles come to and drive past the hotel. You are a short walk from lots of restaurants and convenience grocery stores including a 7 11 which is important because it is one of the few ATMs that will allow you to get cash with an international card. Sen Oku Hakuko Kan Museum is right across the street. you are also about a 15 minute walk from the main Ropongi bar club strip. The hotels Highlander Bar is expensive but definitely worth having a least one drink \u2026 super cool. I was always too underdressed to go to the Orchid Bar but from what I saw nice. The gym is large with a decent array of equipment including the old school vibrating belt machine and a large white hypobaric chamber which I was explicitly told I could not photograph not sure why. There is also a luxury shopping mall in the basement of the hotel. My only complaint would be no iron in the room. We would have to call to the front desk to have one sent up. No matter how well you pack your clothes will have serious wrinkles after 13 hours in a suitcase so a readily available iron would be nice. That said I would certainly stay at the Okura again and would recommend it to others.", "offset": [1801, 1999], "date": "2016-07-21 00:00:00", "cpt": "0", "category": "fitness"}, {"id": 9, "uid": "c923de7a-b548-4d91-ad39-9fee917dd249", "sentence": "Somewhat tired but undergoing renovations. The Okura is a bit of an institution it still attracts overseas government officials and famous Japanese as it has done for many years but overall it is feeling dated nowadays. Yes it does feel more local and traditional than some of the international hotels in the area but the dated 60s feel decoration does not do much for me and the attraction remains the convenience if you work in the area and the usually competitive room rates versus the Hyat or Ritz Carlton etc. However that is not always a guarantee in recent times since hotel is undergoing a major much needed rebuild right now ahead of the Olympics and only the South Wing building remains open. Room availability is therefore significantly reduced meaning that they ramp up the prices if demand is high so check your rate and shop around since this place is nothing special. Rooms are ok but have not changed much in the 15 years or so I have being staying here. Having to pay extra to use the gym is always an annoyance too I can not think of any other hotel I have stayed at in recent years that still pulls that one. Overall if you like the more traditional feel are working close by or can get a decent rate then it is worth a stay but do take a look around as there are other decent more modern options in the vicinity.", "offset": [971, 1127], "date": "2016-08-19 00:00:00", "cpt": "0", "category": "fitness"}, {"id": 10, "uid": "12ea2787-29f8-4640-b398-381d3c578836", "sentence": "Classic Tokyo hotel.
