I happened to stay in this hotel just for a night stay with my family. and I am happy to say all of us very very satisfied with the quality of the hotel and the services available at an affordable price. Our family was on pilgrimage and it was very late almost 12 in the mid night and we were in a search of good family hotel just to spend a night. It was very difficult to find a suitable hotel at this hour of night and one thing clicked to my mind was to go to Ginger. LocationLocation of hotel is very good and convenient as it provide you easy access to all the directions. Being of Pune Bangalore Highway near Hinjewadi you can find most of your needs taken care. RomsRoms very pretty good and clean. The bed was comfortable. You can have different facilities available in the room like complementary water bottle tea coffee maker kettle with the tea coffee sugar kits Refrigerator a good size wardrobe work desk and a free wi fi facility. Initially we had a problem with our AC not working but the same was got corrected with 10 minutes by one of the support staff. Bathrooms Toilet were also very clean and neatly maintained. ServicesYou can enjoy your breakfast lunch and dinner at the restaurant located within the hotel. I can not write more about the food quality as we could not enjoy the same due to our need to rush in the morning. Only drawback I felt was shortage of staff compared to the rooms available in the hotel. Overall I can say this is the best hotel at a much reasonable and affordable price compared to the other hotels which gives full value of your money.", "offset": [986, 1112], "date": "2015-05-13 00:00:00", "cpt": "0", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 2, "uid": "06356522-4e8f-4927-bd78-da5851a22874", "sentence": "a lodge feeling. unhappy. the hotel is below average. all the staff right from reception to room service and housekeeping below average. more interested in tips than service and they make it very clear about it.
