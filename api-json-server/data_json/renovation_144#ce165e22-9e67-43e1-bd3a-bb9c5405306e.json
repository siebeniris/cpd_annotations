Really enjoyed our time at The Westin Long Beach. Was a pleasant surprise to find a cooler chiller in our room to keep our water cool. Nice walk to Aqaurium of the Pacific. The bed was so comfortable and the shower was amazing would have bought one of those if they had offered it. The pool was too hot for me to enjoy would have been more refreshing a few degrees cooler but hubby enjoyed it immensely. Have to give a HUGE shout out to J Kennedy. The Lobby Bar she really is top shelf when it comes to knowing her customers and how to quench their thirst. Hard working I witnessed her picking up snacks pl had dropped on the floor with a napkinothers were cleaning the whole time we were there as well really clean clean placeBUT I have never seen a bartender come around and clean the floor on the other side of the bar. Really impressed us. She deserves credit for doing such an amazing job and smiling the whole time while pl are yelling at their football teams and she never forgot a drink food order snack or to place a gentlemans forgotten knapsack behind the bar until he realized and came back. Alot of the staff were wonderful while we stayed the weekend but she is the one we will be telling our friends about back home. Thanks for making it a great time J Kennedy you are the Best.

After a long two weeks in California for business I decided to treat myself to the Westin for my last night before heading home to Canada.

He was friendly and got it running. I went to the pool for an hour and when I came back the cooler was not working again. All I wanted to do was chill some wine and drinks. I called down again and the front desk lady proceeded to tell me the cooler was not a fridge and that it does not get very cold. but she said she would send someone up. I was not very happy as the lady had attitude. I left the room for an hour and when I returned it was still warm. I pulled the TV stand away from the wall to see if the cooler was plugged in it was filthy so I put tv stand back.

I went to the restaurant only twice as both times I tried to order items to only discover they were out and we are restocking until after the renos are complete. No draft beer available and the only bottle beer was Bud and a local porter. Other menu items were hit or miss.
