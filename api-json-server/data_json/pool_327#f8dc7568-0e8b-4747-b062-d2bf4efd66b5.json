The continental breakfast was great. Coffee was great. The room was a nice size with a refrigerator microwave and toaster. The only thing I do not recommend is walking around the neighborhood to the La Jola Cove. it is farther than you think and I got the impression that the locals really do not like strangers walking through their neighborhoods.

A major refurbishment was underway when we arrived and we were allocated a room right beside the works. There was excessive noise until 630 in the evening and then from 8 in the morning and lots of dust. Builders were walking past our room all day. The hotel and bokingcom websites do not flag this up and I alerted them over a week ago so suggest you check before you book.
