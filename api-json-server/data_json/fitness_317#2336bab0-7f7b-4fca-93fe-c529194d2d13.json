Driving to registration you see huge buffalo that are fenced in and part of the property. They apparently are very friendly. The actual registration area is contained within its own building. It was beautifully decorated with couches and a fireplace and it reminded me of a private game reserve in South Africa we stayed at a few years back. The front desk agents were polite and helpful and secured an Audi to transport me around the property. The property is large so there are audis and drivers on call for you at all times. The valet moved my car to the parking spot in front of my cottage when it was ready and delivered my bags to my cottage. The cottages also reminded me of the private game reserve. The cottage had canopied ceilings an indoor and outdoor shower firepit outdoor bathtub lounge chairs with heat lamps and decent but not great toiletries. There was never a shortage of free bottles of water in the bedroom and bathroom and each night housekeeping delivered a small box of salted caramel chocolates. The bed was comfortable and I believe was made up with Frete linens. The food was pretty outstanding. We had breakfast lunch and dinner for four nights at Farm and one night at the Hilltop. I am a vegetarian so I did have to remind them to offer food other than pasta at lunch and dinner but they did do it and made a wonderful bean dish and tofu dish. There are two outdoor heated pools one that is adults only and one for families. Both are nice. The family pool is alongside the gym. it is a decent sized gym and the equipment was advanced. The treadmills and elipticals each had touch screen internet. I am not a gym person as I workout outdoors so I am not too familIar with equipment but this seemed advanced with the internet although the connection was slow. All in all it was a wonderful stay. For about 60 night in the off season it was a bit pricey and it would have been nice if breakfast and tea time were included like at some other hotels in napa valley. Despite that I would return especially in the non winter months when flowers are in bloom and it is much warmer.", "offset": [1612, 1668], "date": "2015-01-17", "cpt": "0", "category": "fitness"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "83920ebd-7e7f-41c6-9312-751ffacf97e5", "sentence": "Great Getaway.

We stayed at Carneros for 4 nights in April. The property is is just beautiful and perfect if you want to get away and just relax. Our room was not huge but felt luxurious with hardwood floors nice linens leather chair fireplace and heated floors in the bathroom. The outdoor space for our room was not the best this property has to offer. Many cottages have a tub and a firepit. Ours had neither and that was a disappointment. Having said that it had two loungers with a heating lamp and a table and 4 chairs for dining. The bathroom was fantastic. It was large with plenty of natural light two people can shower at the same time in the indoor shower and there is an outdoor shower as well. My only complaint is that if you order room service there is no place to sit and eat properly inside the room other than on the bed. A couple of TV dinner tables would solve that issue. We ate breakfast at Boon Fly cafe every morning. It was good although can get repetitive. The on site market is definitely a good option for a lighter breakfast with varied choices. you will be able to get bagels fruit smoothies etc. Farm restaurant was closed for most of our stay. that is was a bit disappointing as well. Our spa experience was very good. Be prepared to spend a lot of money on their services. The adult pool sits on top of a hill overlooking the countryside. It is just lovely. We found the service at the pool to be efficient and friendly.

There are a lot of great hotels in the Napa Valley area so making the right choice is not easy. We selected this hotel because it looked very attractive and the opportunity to enjoy the private outdoor space that each cottage offered greatly appealed to us. We stayed in a Harvest Cottage so that we would have an outdoor tub and fire pit in addition to the standard cottage amenities such as an outdoor rain shower. We were surprised at the size of the exterior space which also included a deck and garden area that had two lounge chairs with a heater above them a cushioned covered bench a caf\u00e9 table for two and a small fountain. All within your own totally private walled haven. This made for a truly special and very unique hotel experience. The inside of the cottage was also very nice but the space is very tight. The layout is long and narrow but we did enjoy the wall of windows and doors out to the garden area along with windows facing each exposure and a gas fireplace. However the closet was so small we could not put one of our bags in it. The solution was to put one next to the front door partially in front of a chair and the other in the spacious bathroom. In fact the bathroom is also where you will find the coffee maker and cups water bottles and other items normally found in the bedroom space. The cottage was wonderful it is just a shame that the designers did not give the inside some more thought and perhaps just cut back a little on the outdoor space to add to the interior. Other highlights of the hotel include two main pools and a kid \u2019s pool. The adult pool at the top of the resort with great views gets lots of comments and attention but for us the family pool was in a more interesting setting. Four palm trees line each side of the pool and the pool is surrounded on three sides by white barn style structures. A pretty setting is created and one of the barn structures is the large fully equipped gym that usually had its wide French doors opened to the pool. It was a great setup. We described the setting and layout of the hotel to friends as a cute upscale farm town. The tin roof cottages have rocking chair porches clustered in little villages with landscaped pathways to guide you to the various other areas of the hotel including the restaurants and useful marketplace. As for the restaurants their early week opening times are limited and their menus a little on the fancy side. No worries the valley has great restaurants. The location of the hotel is pretty good especially if you plan on visiting both Sonoma and Napa Valleys. We did notice however that on breezy or windy days this location seems to be effected more than other areas. We loved the refined and comfortable atmosphere of the hotel the private outdoor space amenities and outstanding architecture.

Was much better before and for the price of staying there you expect exceptional in all aspects. You can also tell now that Plumpjack no longer owns the resort things are starting to look tired and worn out. We had a 2 bedroom cottage and the back yard was in disrepair. Broken off light poles for the landscape lighting to shrubs and mulch not good. Our hot tub out back had garbage literally in it. A go gurt was literally on the bottom of it. Not ideal. Otherwise pool was great restaurants are spectacular. We used the free bikes to bike to a winery. very fun. Bocci courts are great.

Almost Perfect Stay. My wife and I travel worldwide for business and pleasure so our standards are very very high. We booked two rooms one for our parents as a surprise. The Service at this hotel was top notch from the check in and room delivery to the restaurant service. Think of your own little cottage tiny but high end with rocking chairs on the front porch and heated floors in the marble bathroom. Every employee went out of their way without being obtrusive which is a great compliment to the manager. After we had eaten at the upscale restaurant and wanted something more mellow for the next night our server female but am forgetting her name. combined partial room service and a restaurant meal in the lounge area seamlesly for the four of us. The pool area is beautiful and in spite of the fact that they are remodeling the spa we heard almost no noise and it did not affect our stay. It was fun to watch our parents who are in their 80s but well travelled first scoff at the sheet metal fences and look and then over the next 48 hours fall in love with the place. The only reason for the Almost in this review is the Boon Fly Cafe. This is actually outside the property you have to go through an exit gate to get to it and both my wife and I thought it might be owned by a different owner. the service was horrible case in point. when the hostess at the front desk called to find some information she could not get anyone to pick up. thre times. the four of us went there for dinner and after sitting down we all looked at each other and made for the door. there was just something lacking in the organization feel and service. even at a casual restaurant at a resort the service should be good. Then when we showed up in the morning the waitress pointed to the clock and said we stopped serving breakfast five minutes ago. when we asked if they could just do some simple eggs or anything brunchy. she said no. no explanation no accommodation or suggestions. compare this to the help at the Market on the property where they could not go out of their way enough to help us prepare a picnic lunch for a fun adventure.

We were excited to try a different place in the Napa region as we have stayed at some exceptional places re The Poetry Inn Auberge de Soleil. We went here to attend a fabulous wedding of dear friends. We thought for the cost of 10 it would be spectacular. It was not. The roofs are made of corrugated and walls surrounding the backyards in tin which possibly an effort to keep a charming look. To us it just looked cheap and it is just not the roof I think they made a deal on it as it was everywhere. The unit we stayed was about the size of small trailer. Small. the best part about it was the outdoor shower. My wife and I thought we would go to the spa for a relaxing steam jacuzi and massage early the morning after arriving and traveling all day. OMG. The spa was just a converted unit with two massage beds. No sauna and a small 3\u2019x3 \u2019 outside jacuzi and the cover was dirty and not appealing to us. When I asked where is the spa I was told for the first time that the spa is being renovated and will be open in a couple of weeks. No mention was this ever made when we made the reservations and to top it off the cost of an hour massage was 175. Sad how they took advantage of us. Poor management. If you try to call the front desk or really anyone for that matter including spa you get a recording and telling you a call back will be forthcoming looking like it \u2019s understaffed. Now the good stuff. The bell staff and people around the property could not have been nicer and the wedding was spectacular including the food bar and scenery.

We had a perfect stay at Carneros from the moment we pulled onto the property to when we left 3 nights later. The property is organized into little neighborhoods in which all guests have their own cottage or house with a private backyard.

The room itself was perfect equipped with a small seating area a fireplace a very comfortable king sized bed and a massive bathroom. Outside we had a private deck and patio complete with an outdoor bathtub. It was completely enclosed to ensure privacy. We loved turning on the fireplace each morning while sipping on an espresso. Everything about the room is perfect very well thought out and every amenity you could possibly need is available. The location of Carneros is also ideal. You are situated well to explore both Napa and Sonoma Valleys. If you are further north in Napa it is much harder to get into Sonoma even though they look quite close on a map. The wines that come out of the carneros region are superb and a welcome change if you have been hitting the heavy cabs all day long. Shout out to the valet team they were super nice and gave us fantastic recommendations when we were exploring other towns. As some reviewers mention it is obviously pricey but nearly as much as some of the other luxury accommodations in Napa Valley.
