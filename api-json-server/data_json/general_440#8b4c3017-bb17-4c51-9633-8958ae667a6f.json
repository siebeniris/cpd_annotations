The family occasion 80th birthday and the wonderful setting ambiance and service far outstripped the food. Our table starter salad was very unimaginative and lacked taste.

Tasty but no great shakes the springbok steak was good even though one was returned to be cooked more the duck was excellent. Food presentation was simple and accompanied by nice veg and chips. Desserts were delicious. Service was great and the wine list had excellent variety. Prices are on the high side.

The hotel had been recommended to us and booked by our SA agent. On arrival it looked OK but it is certainly not quiet or secluded. In fact the nearby main road is busy. When we first arrived I had a horrible feeling. The chap taking the cases was over the top and the reception personnel were rather grumpy. When we return to our room and away from reception we noticed that the areas are rather dirty. The room was frankly a disgrace it looked like something out of a 1980s old peoples home. Most of the fittings were plastic the television was 15 years old the bathroom look like a prison cell with old peoples support structures and a plastic seat in the shower and once again the areas were essentially unmaintained and dirty. We called our agent to express our dismay and we were fortunate that she was able to get us accommodation elsewhere. We collected all belongings and returned to reception to tell them we were leaving. To be fair they were apologetic and we had no problems in getting a full refund from the hotel.

The Cellars Hohenort was not my first choice but on this trip we really wanted to stay in Constantia we usually stay in Camps Bay or at the Westin by the Waterfront. All the other places I looked at were completely booked up and we found a room at the Cellars Hohenort. I am so glad that we landed up staying there. It was so peaceful and relaxing to be surrounded by the gardens. And even though it felt secluded we were able to get around Cape Town very quickly and comfortably. It was easy to get to the hotel from the airport and the drive was lovely. We went past Kirstenbosch Gardens and through leavy suburbs. From the moment we pulled up at the front gate we were impressed with the friendliness of the staff. Our room was comfortable and we had an outdoor seating area which was wonderful and we enjoyed watching the ducks splash around in the pond in front. The gardens were sublime. It was so relaxing to stroll through the gardens and see the birds and squirrels among the trees. The food was great. We loved the breakfast and you can sit outside and enjoy the fresh air and garden views. The only upset was when we felt peckish one afternoon and we went to the all day dining restaurant. While we were waiting for the hostess to come and seat us we were looking at the regular menu and when she came to help us the way in which she told us that only afternoon tea was available was very snappy. The afternoon tea was a delight and we ordered cocktails from the bar next door but the hostess manner left a bad taste.", "offset": [655, 755], "date": "2016-06-07", "cpt": "0", "category": "general"}, {"id": 4, "uid": "f5b7cc60-cf7b-4f1a-a2a6-920eac7bd876", "sentence": "Very nice hotel in beautiful gardens.
