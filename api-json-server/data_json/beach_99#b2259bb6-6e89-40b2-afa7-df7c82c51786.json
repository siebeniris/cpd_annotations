We originally planned to stay at the Hilton but after reading reviews decided the Mariot was the way to go. Pros service was incredible. Everyone friendly and worked very hard to make us feel welcome and taken care of. Edsel at the bar across from the reception desk took wonderful care of us. Jenifer the person who cleaned our room was so friendly. Bellmen were all terrific. There was a three hour happy hour at the different bars. Hit those for half price drinks. Beach and pool area beautiful. Choices on excursions from the Mariot were good. Our room was nice. Had a great patio. Cons We were in a one bedroom at the end of the resort near the public beach. It could be a little noisy on weekends and in the morning. Some sort of local exercise class in the water. Service fees on every order and every day in the room. But it is a resort so not surprised. The service fee was not a gratuity. Suggestions Go into town or supermarket to buy beer and water. Much much cheaper. Get to pool or beach by 8 or 9 to claim prime seats. If you are late you can find chairs but might not be the ones you want.

Rm 200 could not of been any bete not only overlooking beach but a great view of ocean.

I can not begin to comment on how friendly and accommodating your staff were toward my wife and myself. Cerita in the board room was outstanding Gichi with her warm welcome each morning for breakfast. We found that Emerald Lounge was the place to be for our dinners great enviorment not to mention outstanding staff Edsel Iwan Ryan to mention a few all great servers One of your greatest asests in Nicolas Chef for Emerald due to some food restriction not many. Nicolas acomdate everything and by the way his French Onion Soup is one of the best I have ever had. he truly listens to guests. Suggestion. In my line of work Operations both my wife and myself notice a lot. One thing was your deli Please do not take me out of content your staff were very good but you are loosing revenue when your guest leave your facility to shop at the local supermarket for staples that you should be carrying in your deli.

We stayed here for three nights in mid January. Our room was practically on the beach with the water just beyond. Sunsets were amazing. I was hoping that this resort and casino would not be overly active raucous or crowded and I was not disappointed. It was so laid back making the relaxation factor that much better. We spent each day mainly lying on the beach not even using the pretty pool. We were able to use the free Mariot shuttle for a quick trip to Wilemstad one day and had fun checking out the pontoon bridge historic fort and iconic row of colorful buildings along the water. The staff are really friendly and genuine. We ate dinner at the resort for two of the three nights and the food was mediocre to good. There are not many options for snacks or smaller meals.

I visited this resort for five nights in early February 2015. This was my first visit along with my partner. The setting is great as it is not too too far from the center of Wilemstad if you are interested in milling about the touristy parts of town. The resort has a wonderful pool area which boasts unobstructed views of the ocean from all sides of the pool which as other reviews have noted includes a swim up bar which is quite cool. Nothing like sipping a drink in a pool while gazing at turquoise ocean water. We had to act early however to ensure getting chaises at the pool. There is a finite number of available chaises and if you wait past 1AM you are sure to be shut out of getting a good spot let alone a bad one if you are a couple. The beach is also quite nice. As others have noted bring water shoes as the water has many rocks the beach itself is sandy but once you enter the water it is rocks everywhere. My biggest issue with the beach given this is a resort is that there is no waiter service for drinks food on the beach. The pool offers this but not the beach. While there is a beach bar stand I found the service there to be poor and the sole bar person there to be surly. The food at the restaurants was consistently decent. Not outstanding but decent. The service across all the restaurants was consistently slow. The staff was quite pleasant and accommodating but many of the staff from our perspective were perhaps novices and seemed unsure of things. Again everyone was very pleasant but there was one dinner at the SeaBreze when the entire meal took two and a half hours from being seated to getting the check. that is a pretty long time commitment to dinner. The rooms also are slightly dated for a Mariot property. Certainly they are clean and adequate but as others have noted this is not a luxury property in my opinion. While we were visiting we visited other properties to compare. The Mariot is nicer than the Hilton which is next door. The Floris Suite does not offer an on site beach but it IS an adults only facility so that is a plus for a child less couple. The Santa Barbara is GORGEOUS but very far from Wilemstad. I think if I returned to Curacao I had consider staying here again if the price were favorable compared to other hotels. If the Santa Barbara offered a similar rate I had opt to stay there instead.

Waters off the beach are choppy. The music playing at the Seabreze bar during the day and by DJ Friday night had swear words. Inappropriate for the childrenWhat bothered us the most is this. Curacao charges 10 service charge that is divided amongst the staff and a 7 sales tax. For some reason Mariot ups both to 15 service charge and 9 sales tax. The wine was terrible. We paid 9 US for a glass of gross wine plus the 15 service charge and 9 sales tax only to go off site and purchase a bottle of the same terrible wine for 10 US. If you are going to overcharge the customer at least provide an exclusive brand of wine that we may enjoy spending money on. Import some. Ordered mojitos at Emerald Lounge one night. They are advertised for their impressive mojitos. They were out of mint leaves. That knocked off 3 4 drink options. PROS. The lobby is pretty. View from the room was nice relaxing. Room was clean. Server Richard in Portofino provided amazing service. He deserves a raise and should train other servers. Martis bartender at Seabreze Lounge hustled as well with a great personality.
