We stayed at the Hilton Memphis the entire time. I am writing a very detailed review of pros and cons. We used e check in and selected a room on the 23rd floor. At the check in desk I asked if there were any available upgrades since he is Gold and I am Diamond and it was my birthday but even after explaining all that we were told no. For those who say you can not hear the road noise from the room that is NOT true. We were on the 23rd floor and it sounded like the semi trucks were driving right past our window. Trust me the traffic was loud. The walls here are extremely thin. to the point that you can hear full conversations in the room next door. If there are screaming kids next to you like we had. then you will have a hard time sleeping in if they get up early OR trouble going to sleep if their parents let them stay up late. Please be aware that there is NO refrigerator or microwave in the rooms. The bigger suites on higher floors might have them but not the normal rooms. So we had to get ice every night to put our drinks in. The ice machines are only located on every other floor. When going to get the ice my boyfriend had problems getting the elevator to stop on our floor. This happened multiple nights in a row. Also there were several nights when the lights were flickering in the elevator at NIGHT which was very frightening. I felt like we were on Disneys Tower of Terror. The air conditioning unit in our room was really noisy. It shook the wall in the bathroom so bad that we searched the room to find a solution. We ended up lodging a shower cap box in the crack of the cover to prevent the jarring noise. It worked but guests should not have to come up with MacGyver solutions to stop noises. Although there were 2 of us in the room housekeeping often left us with just 1 towel. I travel a LOT and I normally get 3 towels even when I travel alone. The parking here can be a security concern and a source of road rage. There are only few spots close to the door. The majority of the parking lot is a long distance away. The lot is not very well lit at night and I can say I would not be comfortable walking here at night alone. Additionally I must add that Friday and Saturday nights seemed to draw a lot of rowdy crowds. squealing tires revving engines and loud motorcycles. There is a security guy who rides around the parking lot in a little cart but we watched him and laughed because he seemed to disappear any time there was something going on. Wow I know I said I had give pros and cons but I am realizing most of this is negative. The lobby looks impressive. The pool and hot tub might be nice in season. I can not comment about anything else because we did not use any amenities. Also do not expect to get any complimentary breakfast even if you are Gold or Diamond. Apparently you have to literally stay ON that floor to get the perk. I was the one who picked this hotel because I wanted to stay in the round hotel on a high floor with views. But for the price my boyfriend paid I do not feel we received the value. If visiting Memphis again I had definitely chose another hotel.", "offset": [208, 265], "date": "2015-04-20", "cpt": "0", "category": "room"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "7d64c5dd-5b35-48ce-94ea-1cf329f0dfa0", "sentence": "Very pleasant but room for improvement.

But the people here is what made this stay remarkable. The front desk staff is incredibly friendly and so very helpful. I had a few unusual issues come up and they were more than helpful.

The swimming pool area was out of towels even after asking for 30 minutes to get towels. the pool itself was full of leaves and could tell was not well looked after.

Parking spots were plentiful but no matter where you parked it was a trek to the front door. My check in experience was fast but I felt rushe. The front desk clerk got right back on the phone after tiving me my key before I could ask about Wi Fi. I also had to ask her how to even get ro the elevators. What the clerk did not tell me was that floor 2 was actually in the basement. Upon entering my room it looked nice until I looked closer. I was right outside the pool area thankfully it was not pool season or I would have heard noise all day. Still the was were very thin I could hear people talking walking closing their door and even showering. There was dust everywhere along with random stains on the bathroom door. The towels had dirty spots on them. When I showered the tub barely drained and the faucet leaked terribly. I complained about these things but nothing was done. I was so worried about cleanliness I wrapped myself in the blanket I brought and slept in it like a cocoon on top of the sheets. To be the Hilton and have such a nice exterior and lobby area the room was old and gross. Customer service was also definitely lacking.

We stayed in a block of rooms reserved in advance on the 24th floor. We normally stay in budget. 50 70 motels about 15 nights a year. These are usually single night stays on our yearly trip to Calif from Ohio to see our daughter. My review tries to use higher standards than our budget motels but I really do not have the experience that Mark H does to evaluate this level of hotel I am not trying to be snotty to MarkThis hotel is more of a convention location and resort hotel than a travelers overnight stay. From our experience the positive VERY clean everything safe area luxurious room and furnishings all staff we encountered were very courtious and helpful our room included the breakfast buffet and the service was top notch. the variety and quality were outstanding the only thing that they could have done was cook an omelet to order but that was not necessary considering the selection of items. Negatives while there is a covered entryway but it is crowded busy and parking is a ways from the entrance 100 200 ft the room door was very sticky misaligned tub drained slow toilet seat was loose. I gave my list to the check out staff and as I left I saw a maint. man with my list in his hand. Also there is no ref. or micro in room as this is not a budget motel and they offer places to eat and drink and a market if you want to take something to your room. There is a coffee maker though.
