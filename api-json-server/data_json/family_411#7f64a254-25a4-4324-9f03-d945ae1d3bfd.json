I stayed at this property for four nights with my wife on an annual vacation to NoCal wine country. It is our fifth stay at this property and our experience spans the recently completed renovation of all guest rooms. Vintage Inn is located just to the northern end of Yountvile adjacent to the French Laundry gardens and the St Helena highway. The hotel grounds are self enclosed gardens in and of themselves and lend the property a secluded and quiet feel. Downtown Yountvile is a quiet and delightfully smaller version of local wine country towns mostly focusing on restaurants rather than shopping. TripAdvisor folks will know that there are multiple excellent eateries in town with two of them TFL and Bouchon owning Michelin stars and TFL long considered one of the finest in the nation. While the old version of the Vintage Inn was completely fine the renovation has tastefully upgraded the comfortable french country vibe with upgrades to furniture fixtures and most importantly the bathrooms. Within that category there are differing bathroom layouts some have jacuzi tubs with a integrated shower that is a little awkward to use others have a very large dual use shower setup that is to my mind superior. All rooms as well as the common area are very well appointed impeccably clean and quiet. Parking is directly behind the hotel and accessible via a short walk through the grounds. Food offerings are worth discussing in detail as each morning Vintage offers a large buffet brunch that includes a mimosa bar an omelette station and on the weekends a waffle station as well. The food is of very high quality and there are multiple hot and cold choices on offer including fresh fruit bread muffins pastries and cheeses. The buffet is included in the rate and thus provides excellent value especially as a base meal from which you can attack the wineries up and down the valley. There is an afternoon tea in the main lobby if you are so disposed with more pastries and small sandwiches that is also included in your rate. I have always found service at Vintage to be at the superior level. From reservations to room needs to concierge service to housekeeping customer service is attentive friendly and willing. There also seems to be very little turnover in the core staff signaling a positive workplace with attention to detail our annual chats with Carlos at the omelette station for example are becoming a bit of a tradition. Check in is always friendly and breezy despite the fact that we are sometimes arriving very late at night after a cross country flight from IAD and subsequent drive up from SFO. One tiny complaint this year Vintage switched from in room Nespreso machines to in room Keurig machines. While this is clearly a matter of taste I preferred the coffee made by the former and despise the coffee made by the latter. Feel free to attach firstworldproblems to this whine and if it matters to you Bouchon Bakery makes excellent coffee less than a block down the street. I unreservedly recommend this hotel to all travelers heading to wine country. Given the quality of the rooms food and service I had even call this a bargain despite NY SF DC level pricing especially when you factor in the included breakfast brunch. We have yet to experience anything other than a delightful experience at this property and look forward to our next visit in December 2016.", "offset": [51, 150], "date": "2015-12-16", "cpt": "0", "category": "family"}, {"id": 5, "uid": "dadbd90c-b7a0-41d3-a156-3a17d13ce71c", "sentence": "Nothing like the perfect BED.

My fianc\u00e9e and I spent two nights at the Vintage Inn on a recent trip to visit Napa Valley wineries and we could not have been any happier with our hotel selection. We found the Vintage Inn and the town of Yountvile to be the perfect places to stay as a home base for our trip. The inn was just so cute and quaint \u2013 small enough to feel cozy large enough to operate as a well run hotel. Everything at the Vintage Inn from the room to the breakfast to the staff to the location was top notch and exceeded expectationsChosing the Hotel. This was our first trip to the Napa Valley so before arriving we really did n\u2019t have a good sense of the geography of the area. We identified pretty quickly that Napa Yountvile or St Helena would be the main towns to choose from for accommodations. My initial thought was to stay in the town of Napa simply because it was a familiar name which we assumed would be the center of the Napa Valley. However that \u2019s not really the case and after visiting I \u2019m glad we chose to stay in Yountvile instead. Napa is basically the first major town you encounter when driving into the valley from the San Francisco area and it \u2019s nice enough but it \u2019s more built up and more busy than we were looking for with many chain hotels restaurants and stores around. It is a larger town with more permanent residents and activity whereas Yountvile feels like a sleepy little village seemingly there almost solely for the benefit of tourists. Fine dining cute boutiques and wine shops are all within walking distance and everything looks perfect at all times in Yountvile. Beyond liking the quaint feel of Yountvile we found Yountvile to be much more convenient than Napa for visiting wineries St Helena would also be quite convenient. When driving up either the Silverado Trail or Route 29 the main concentration of wineries does n\u2019t really begin until you hit Yountvile and the towns going north. By staying at the Vintage Inn we were always close to the wineries we wanted to visit and could easily stop back at the hotel any time if we wanted or needed to. After identifying Yountvile as our ideal location for our accommodations we looked into the various hotel options in the town. The Vintage Inn and Vilago its very similar sister hotel right down the street both quickly came up quickly as options to consider. We also looked at several other hotels in Yountvile all of which looked great. However even though we were going to be staying during the shoulder season in November and we would be there on Sunday and Monday nights the prices still managed to be pretty high at every hotel in Yountvile. While exploring our options I noticed that Hotwire was offering one of its Hot Rate deals for a 4star hotel in Yountvile at a rate that was 50 less than the cheapest rate we were finding for any hotel in Yountvile at the time. The only catch was that the name of the hotel would n\u2019t be revealed until after we had booked and paid and it could n\u2019t be cancelled. Since every possible hotel option in Yountvile was appealing to us we were willing to take the risk. I was pretty sure we \u2019d get either the Vintage Inn or Vilago anyway and it turns out we got the Vintage Inn. The one and only somewhat frustrating experience with the Vintage Inn came right after we made our reservation. Hotwire specified that we were n\u2019t able to choose our room type and that the hotel would choose the room type for us based upon availability. Although we preferred a room with a king bed we were willing to take the risk that we \u2019d get a room with two beds to save money. I decided to call the hotel after we made our reservation in order to put in a request for a king bed. When I called the staff member I spoke with in the reservations department indicated that we had been blocked into a standard room with two queen beds. I had already done my research online and knew that the hotel still had standard rooms with a king bed available for our dates which sell for the same price as the standard rooms with two queens. I explained that we had booked on Hotwire and knew the hotel had discretion to choose our room type but that we would prefer to be blocked into an equivalent room with a king bed if possible. Her response was that our Hotwire reservation specified that we had to have a room with two beds so they could not change that in their system. She did note our request for a king bed which she said would be handled upon arrival. However I just found it odd that she acted as if the hotel had no control over its own reservations. The staff member I spoke with was n\u2019t necessarily rude but it seemed like it would be a really easy switch to block us into a king room. On the flip side since Hotwire specified that the hotel had full discretion to choose our room type I reminded myself that it was ultimately up to the hotel to choose to our room. During our stay we ended up with a perfect room with a king bed that we wanted so everything turned out fine. Arrival Experience. As soon as we drove up to the Vintage Inn I was pretty sure we had chosen the right hotel. The minute you turn off of Highway 29 into Yountvile you are transported into an idyllic little village and the Vintage Inn just fits into it perfectly with its well manicured grounds pretty flowers and rooms set up in various buildings that each look slightly different all with the feeling of French provincial cottages. We arrived on a Sunday morning around 930 am just to see the property and get the basic check in mechanics handled before departing for a day of wine tasting. The man who was working at the front desk at the time was extremely nice and personable. He gave the feeling that the staff was genuinely delighted that we had arrived and would be staying there for the next two nights. The front desk staff at most hotels is significantly more cold and business like. He was extremely apologetic about the fact that our room was n\u2019t yet ready at 930 am I never would have expected it to be ready anyway and offered to expedite room cleaning for us. Without me even mentioning it he also noted our request for a king bed and confirmed that a king room was available for us. He also encouraged us to take advantage of the hotel \u2019s complimentary breakfast which was set up in the lobby and outside on the patio at the time. We received a call about 90 minutes later to let us know that our room was ready for check in but we did n\u2019t have a chance to go back until around 60 pm. The staff member working at that time was also very nice and I was impressed that after simply mentioning that we had already checked in and that I was there to pick up our room keys she knew who I was and immediately greeted me by name giving the feeling that she had been expecting us. Room. After initially being worried that we were n\u2019t going to get a good room we ended up feeling like we had one of the best rooms at the hotel. We were given a king room on the second floor of one of the buildings closest to the main lobby building overlooking the pool Room 805. We had a great view but also appreciated that we were so close to the lobby for breakfast and afternoon tea although no room is overly far from it. The room itself was just lovely. It was spacious but felt so cozy which was great on the chilly fall evenings that we were there. I highly recommend requesting a room on the second floor since it allowed us to have great vaulted ceilings in the room which contributed even more to the feeling of spaciousness. The only negative to the second floor is that there are no elevators so you \u2019l have to carry luggage up the stairs to get to the room. However that \u2019s a small price to pay. It was obvious that the rooms and bathrooms here are recently renovated and they \u2019ve done a great job of making the updates that really matter like installing new bathroom fixtures and bedding while retaining the classic features that make this hotel unique such as the stone fireplaces in every room comfortable armchairs to sink into and nice area rugs and accessories. The bed was extremely comfortable and nice for sleeping off a day of wine drinking. It was so nice that a complimentary bottle of wine was waiting for us in the room with glasses and a wine opener ours was a cabernet sauvignon from Sonoma and the wood burning fireplace was also easy to operate with a Duraflame log and matches ready to go. I also appreciated the twice daily room cleaning with turndown service as well as some other little things like the nicely sized mini fridge and the separate wifi network for each room with complimentary Internet access. The bathroom was one of my favorite parts of the room. It was very spacious featuring a large vanity with double sinks and plenty of storage for toiletries underneath or on the counter. The L\u2019Ocitane toiletries are a nice treat as well. The floors and all fixtures were clearly recently re done but the piece de resistance of the bathroom was the enormous walk in shower which could literally hold an entire family. There were separate showerheads at either end of the shower which was beautifully finished with white subway tiles all around and very pretty iridescent tiles on the bottom. Overall it was clear that bathrooms had been a focus of the hotel \u2019s renovations and I think it was definitely money well spent. Although the room was very spacious and comfortable it was really nice to also have a separate covered balcony. Our balcony was quite pleasant and large with a nice outdoor couch and chair and a good pool view to one side. Since the hotel is right off of Highway 29 others have commented that the rooms can be loud with traffic noise. We could not hear any traffic noise at all from our room but we could hear it from our balcony. However this noise was n\u2019t significant enough to be much of a bother. I really do n\u2019t have enough good things to say about our room at the Vintage Inn. Our room felt like a really comfortable guest room in someone \u2019s home not a generic hotel room. The only thing I would note is to be aware of leaving windows open in your room. The hotel is designed with all exterior corridors with each room having windows on multiple sides which is really nice for getting plenty of natural light. However it also means you might find something like a big window in your bathroom directly overlooking an exterior corridor. We had this and our housekeeper would always leave it open which was n\u2019t a big deal but we had to make sure to be cognizant to close the window and shutters to avoid being on display to passers by. Grounds Amenities Location As I \u2019ve already mentioned the grounds at the Vintage Inn are wonderfully park like and pretty. There is essentially one main courtyard in the middle that most rooms open out onto which features well manicured landscaping and fountains. It \u2019s a small enough property that you can walk from one end to the other in about two or three minutes and all rooms are relatively convenient to the main parking lot that runs behind the property on the Highway 29 side. I think the Vintage Inn really does have a prime location for touring the Napa Valley. It \u2019s in Yountvile which is both well located and perfectly cute with great restaurants shops and tasting rooms within walking distance. The Vintage Inn is right in the center with world renowned restaurants like the French Laundry less than a block away. The V Marketplace is right across the parking lot and we even went hot air ballooning one morning with a company based there Aloft Napa Valley which was an excellent memorable experience just a couple minutes \u2019 walk away from our room. As far as amenities there is the outdoor pool and hot tub which our room overlooked. The pool area was attractive and would be quite pleasant for swimming during a warmer time of year. I suspect that the pool must be heated since it was open when we were there in November and I saw other guests using it on a couple occasions. I know there is also a fitness center which I believe is located slightly ofsite somewhere between the Vintage Inn and Vilagio. I never ventured over to see it. The dedicated spa for the hotel the Spa Vilagio is over at the Vilago hotel which is about a five minute walk down Washington Street past the V Marketplace and a couple other businesses and parking lots. Dining. Vintage Inn does n\u2019t its own restaurant but it certainly does n\u2019t need to since there are several highly rated and well regarded restaurants in Yountvile within walking distance. We tried Thomas Keller \u2019s Bouchon and had a very pleasant dinner there as well as RD Kitchen for something a bit more casual. Both were quite nice but I thought Bouchon was the better of the two. However the dining that is offered at the Vintage Inn is great. A complimentary hot breakfast is offered to all guests each morning in addition to tea each afternoon. The breakfast is offered in the lobby where the food is attractively displayed right when you walk in with a bunch of tables available to one side. There is also a very attractive outdoor patio right off of the lobby with more seating. We chose to take our breakfast outside each morning since the weather was nice and there was more space outside. It was just lovely sitting out on the patio to start each morning. The food offered on the buffet is really high quality which also impressed me. In addition to Chandon champagne and various juices to make mimosas the breakfast included a large selection of pastries that were quite tasty as well fresh fruit a nice selection of Clover Farms yogurt delicious biscuits with sausage gravy and breakfast potatoes. Outside on the patio a chef was making omelets to order with various toppings and the omelets I had were some of the best I \u2019ve had at a hotel breakfast buffet. As a whole the breakfast here was one of the best I \u2019ve had at a hotel anywhere so it seemed like such a value that it was included in the room rate. The only thing that was disappointing about breakfast was that the made to order waffle station was n\u2019t available everyday. When we stopped in briefly on our check in day a Sunday we did n\u2019t eat too much from the buffet but I noticed that there was a waffle station outside in addition to the omelet station. I was really looking forward to trying a waffle the next two mornings we \u2019d be there but found that the waffles must only be offered on weekends since they were n\u2019t available on Monday or Tuesday. I \u2019m not sure why this would be a weekend only item since the hotel felt no less crowded on Monday or Tuesday when we were there. Regardless the breakfast was just lovely and delicious and I could n\u2019t think of a better way to start our mornings at the Vintage Inn than to enjoy a mimosa and tasty hot breakfast on the patio. We also stopped into the lobby one afternoon to check out the afternoon tea offerings. There is n\u2019t as much offered for afternoon tea but it \u2019s still nice. Lemonade tea cookies and scones are available which we took back with us to our room and enjoyed on the balcony. The afternoon tea felt a little bit sparse in comparison to breakfast but it was a nice feature too. Overall Overall I really have nothing but positive things to say about the Vintage Inn. It \u2019s a small hotel that is well run and well maintained. The rooms are spacious nicely decorated and comfortable. We could not have felt happier with our decision to stay here as it contributed in a positive way to a couple of wonderful days in the Napa Valley. We enjoyed starting each day with breakfast at the hotel and ending each day walking to dinners in quaint Yountvile. I really did n\u2019t want to leave when our two night stay was over.

My wife and I spent two nights at Vintage House on a recent trip to visit Napa Valley wineries and it was our second time at this hotel. Although we had a good trip we were disappointed that our stay was not nearly as good as last time when the hotel was still Vintage Inn. We concluded that the renovations and re branding from Vintage Inn to Vintage House do n\u2019t really add much to the experience and we were disappointed to find that several amenities have been cheapened or completely removed since our stay two years ago. Despite this since the property is nice and the location in Yountvile is perfect it may still be worth considering. Arrival Experience Since we had such an exceptional stay when the hotel was still the Vintage Inn and we fell in love with the town of Yountvile almost instantly on that previous trip we did n\u2019t even think twice about booking the property again this time especially since we received an email offer with a very good discounted rate for repeat guests. We were excited to arrive at the hotel and see what changes had been made to transform the French country Vintage Inn into the more modern Vintage House. The main lobby building looked totally different from before with a newly whitewashed brick exterior a sleeker and more modern feel and now even valet parking and a doorman features that were n\u2019t present last time we were there. The interior of the lobby was all new now larger and more open with a modern aesthetic in white gray and purple tones. My wife and I were both impressed when we saw the new lobby since it definitely had a more substantial feel than the previous one. Although the old lobby was cozier it was too small so we liked the new expanded space. The friendly staff stood out to us on our last stay and they still seemed nice this time. We had less interaction with staff on this trip but the doorman was really friendly every time we entered or exited the lobby and the front desk staff member who checked us in was nice welcoming us back to the hotel and offering lots of information including a discount card for certain local wineries. I think it would be helpful to let guests know about the wineries where they can obtain discounts in advance as it would be good information to know at the earlier planning stages of a trip. We arrived on a Wednesday afternoon around noon and were excited to find out that our room was ready early so that we could get settled in before an afternoon of wine tastings. Room On our last stay we booked a basic Deluxe King room and had an excellent room in one of the closest buildings to the lobby overlooking the pool. We were hoping for something similar this time especially because we were staying midweek when the hotel did n\u2019t seem overly crowded. We booked the same Deluxe King room again and we were given a room on the second floor of one of the buildings further from the lobby overlooking the parking lot and busy Route 29 Room 605. We ended up being very disappointed with our room location. The way the buildings are set up they are scattered on the hotel \u2019s property between the main street of Yountvile Washington Street and busy Route 29 which serve as the boundaries of the property on either side. Parking is all along the back of the property on the Route 29 side which is what our room faced. It was disappointing to have a bad view of the parking lot and also to be so close to Route 29 which made our room quite noisy at all times of day and night. Even though we booked a basic Deluxe Room which are billed as being on the edges of the property we thought there had to have been a better room in that category especially at a time when the hotel was n\u2019t full. In fact when we \u2019d walk around the hotel at night or early in the morning it was particularly obvious that many rooms were empty because the housekeeping staff would leave rooms fully lit with TVs on overnight basically prepared for new guests at all times. This seemed odd and wasteful and we saw rooms remain empty our entire stay but always with lights and the TV on. We were excited to see what the newly renovated rooms looked like especially since we felt that the rooms were in great condition two years ago before any renovation. The rooms do have a lot of nice features like hardwood floors a very large balcony a wood burning fireplace and lots of windows on all sides for natural light. However we were a little surprised at how little the room d\u00e9cor had changed for a hotel that has supposedly undergone renovations and re branding. From what we could tell all they had done since our last stay was very cosmetic. They replaced the area rug on the floor swapped in a new armchair and settee and added some new lighting and artwork along with painting the natural wood paneling on the ceiling white. None of this really made much difference aside for removing some of the original character and going for a more streamlined and modern look. However since the exterior of the buildings and grounds still have such a classic and cozy look and the rooms still have warmer colored wood floors and an older stone fireplace the room just ended up looking mismatched even though it was nice. If you \u2019ve never stayed here before you \u2019l probably find the rooms to be nice but for those who have it was a little bit of a letdown. We liked it before and do n\u2019t think anything has improved. If anything some of the charm was actually removed and there \u2019s a bit of an identity crisis. It \u2019s unclear what theme or feel they \u2019re going for even though the previous d\u00e9cor was very clearly meant to be a cozy French country feel throughout. The bathroom was one of our favorite parts of the room last time. During that stay we had a huge bathroom with an enormous walk in shower which could literally hold an entire family with two separate showerheads at either end of the shower. Disappointingly instead of having the same type of shower our room this time had a deep jetted jacuzi tub which we did n\u2019t have much interest in using and which also doubled as the shower. It was such an odd shower setup since it was so deep to get into and it was so open with shower water getting all over the bathroom while showering. It was also clear that the tub was n\u2019t meant to double as a shower since the way the showerhead was placed you would have to stand right on the tub drain in order to be under the water. It made for an awkward shower experience and all we really wanted was the shower back from last time. Beyond the shower the bathroom featured a large vanity with double sinks and plenty of storage for toiletries underneath or on the counter. The previous L\u2019Ocitane toiletries that we liked were replaced with new ones that were uninteresting. The bathrooms generally do have a nice look with white subway tile and natural stone floors that feel updated but this was already in place before the renovation. Some other features of the room are great such as the wood burning fireplace that is easy to operate with a log and matches ready to go. We also appreciated the twice daily room cleaning with turndown service with delicious Kolar chocolates. It was also nice that a complimentary bottle of wine was waiting for us in the room when we returned from dinner on the first night a nice bottle from Hill Family Estate along with a note thanking us for returning for another stay. All rooms used to contain a free bottle of wine upon check in so I \u2019m not sure if we only received one this time because we were return guests. Despite having a bad view and highway noise our balcony was pleasant and large with new outdoor furniture to go with the modern theme which included a modern swing and daybed. I would recommend requesting a room on the second floor since it gets you vaulted ceilings which contribute to a feeling of spaciousness. The only negative to the second floor is that there are no elevators so you \u2019l have to carry all luggage up the exterior stairs to get to the room. Another thing I would note is to be aware of which blinds are open in your room. The hotel is designed with all exterior corridors as well as each room having windows on multiple sides which is really nice for getting plenty of natural light. However it also means you might find something like a big window in your bathroom directly overlooking an exterior corridor where others could walk by. Despite being a little disappointed with our room I do appreciate that the rooms here feel more like a comfortable guest room in someone \u2019s home not a generic hotel room. The buildings have character and the rooms clearly are not all the same since we had totally different room shapes and sizes between our two stays. If we returned I would be more specific in requesting the room features we prefer. Grounds Amenities Location. The grounds at Vintage House are wonderfully park like and pretty. There is essentially one main courtyard in the middle that most rooms open onto which features well manicured landscaping and fountains. It \u2019s a small enough property that you can walk from one end to the other in about two or three minutes and all rooms are relatively convenient to the main parking lot that runs behind the property on the Highway 29 side. Being in Yountvile is a huge bonus of this hotel. Yountvile is perfectly cute with great restaurants shops and tasting rooms within walking distance. Vintage House is right in the center with world renowned restaurants like the French Laundry less than a block away. Other Thomas Keller restaurants that we enjoy such as Bouchon and Ad Hoc are also in very easy walking distance. The hotel is technically part of something called the \u201c The Estate \u201d which is essentially just Vintage House its sister hotel Vilagio that \u2019s down the street and the V Marketplace shopping area that is between them. In addition to liking the quaint feel of Yountvile we find Yountvile to be particularly convenient for visiting wineries. When driving up either the Silverado Trail or Route 29 the main concentration of wineries does n\u2019t really begin until you hit Yountvile and the towns going north. As far as amenities there is an outdoor pool and hot tub. The pool area is attractive but we did n\u2019t have time to use it. It \u2019s located right outside of the lobby and appears to have been renovated with new seating in keeping with the modern aesthetic. There were also fire pits by the pool at night that looked nice. The spa for the hotel is over by the Vilagio which is about a five minute walk down Washington Street past the V Marketplace and a couple other businesses and parking lots. It looks very nice from walking by but we have n\u2019t had a chance to try it. Dining. Vintage Inn does n\u2019t have a restaurant but it certainly does n\u2019t need to since there are so many highly rated and well regarded restaurants in Yountvile within walking distance. However a complimentary breakfast is offered to all guests each morning. This was another area where we were very disappointed in changes that have been made since our last stay. The breakfast used to be offered in the lobby but when we were there it was in the Groezinger Estate House building on the end of the property by the lobby which appears to normally be some sort of event space. We were told they were having the breakfast there because Vilagio guests were coming to Vintage House for breakfast while their lobby is under construction. I thought the space itself was nice for breakfast still decorated in the old French country look we preferred and offering lots of tables in a couple of different rooms as well as outdoor seating. A huge thing we loved about the hotel last time was that there were multiple hot options at breakfast each day including really good biscuits and gravy as well as a made to order omelet and waffle station and local champagne and various juices to make your own mimosas. It used to be a very sumptuous buffet for one that was included in the room rate. This time we found that the buffet selections had gone downhill significantly. The omelet waffle station is gone and the number of hot items offered is down to one each day it was some sort of quiche our first day that was cold and then scrambled eggs our second day. The make your own mimosas are gone and they \u2019re now instead selling them for 12 each along with coffee drinks like lattes and cappuccinos for a fee. Other than one hot item per day the breakfast now basically just includes a selection of pastries as well fresh fruit yogurt and charcuterie a relatively simple continental breakfast. Maybe I was just annoyed about the changes but I thought the pastries even went downhill from last time. I recalled them being very high quality but found them to be relatively basic and unremarkable this time. It \u2019s nice that breakfast is included but it \u2019s become the style of one you \u2019d find in a very basic hotel not one of this class. It may be presented nicely in a nice space but it \u2019s nothing special beyond that. We were also disappointed to find that the hotel no longer offers afternoon tea. Last time we enjoyed stopping in the lobby in the afternoon for some lemonade tea cookies and scones which we took back with us to our room and enjoyed on the balcony. There was no mention of this feature this time and we saw no evidence of it so I assume it \u2019s been yet another fatality of the \u201c upgrade \u201d from Vintage Inn to Vintage House. Overall I know we had a bunch of complaints but overall we did have a nice enough stay at Vintage House and a great trip to the Napa Valley. If you \u2019ve never stayed here before you will probably like this small hotel that is well maintained and in a great location. The rooms are spacious nicely decorated and comfortable. However as past guests we were expecting to come back to find the same level of quality if not better knowing that the hotel had been renovated since our last stay. Instead we found a hotel that has definitely not decreased its rates but has definitely decreased what it offers guests. While I left last time ready to recommend this hotel to anyone going to the area I would be more hesitant this time. The rates are far from cheap for a hotel that seems to be having a bit of an identity crisis with very few of its unique extras left. Next time we will probably try somewhere new. Changes have taken an exceptional property and made it much less remarkable. To earn loyalty in a town with so many great options Vintage House needs to up their game or very simply restore some of the services they had in the past.", "offset": [2137, 2327], "date": "2018-11-19", "cpt": "2", "category": "family"}, {"id": 14, "uid": "6c4c7214-eb49-44ed-939f-61b66df5f635", "sentence": "Still Nice Used to be Better. My wife and I spent two nights at Vintage House on a recent trip to visit Napa Valley wineries and it was our second time at this hotel. Although we had a good trip we were disappointed that our stay was not nearly as good as last time when the hotel was still Vintage Inn. We concluded that the renovations and re branding from Vintage Inn to Vintage House do n\u2019t really add much to the experience and we were disappointed to find that several amenities have been cheapened or completely removed since our stay two years ago. Despite this since the property is nice and the location in Yountvile is perfect it may still be worth considering. Arrival Experience Since we had such an exceptional stay when the hotel was still the Vintage Inn and we fell in love with the town of Yountvile almost instantly on that previous trip we did n\u2019t even think twice about booking the property again this time especially since we received an email offer with a very good discounted rate for repeat guests. We were excited to arrive at the hotel and see what changes had been made to transform the French country Vintage Inn into the more modern Vintage House. The main lobby building looked totally different from before with a newly whitewashed brick exterior a sleeker and more modern feel and now even valet parking and a doorman features that were n\u2019t present last time we were there. The interior of the lobby was all new now larger and more open with a modern aesthetic in white gray and purple tones. My wife and I were both impressed when we saw the new lobby since it definitely had a more substantial feel than the previous one. Although the old lobby was cozier it was too small so we liked the new expanded space. The friendly staff stood out to us on our last stay and they still seemed nice this time. We had less interaction with staff on this trip but the doorman was really friendly every time we entered or exited the lobby and the front desk staff member who checked us in was nice welcoming us back to the hotel and offering lots of information including a discount card for certain local wineries. I think it would be helpful to let guests know about the wineries where they can obtain discounts in advance as it would be good information to know at the earlier planning stages of a trip. We arrived on a Wednesday afternoon around noon and were excited to find out that our room was ready early so that we could get settled in before an afternoon of wine tastings. Room On our last stay we booked a basic Deluxe King room and had an excellent room in one of the closest buildings to the lobby overlooking the pool. We were hoping for something similar this time especially because we were staying midweek when the hotel did n\u2019t seem overly crowded. We booked the same Deluxe King room again and we were given a room on the second floor of one of the buildings further from the lobby overlooking the parking lot and busy Route 29 Room 605. We ended up being very disappointed with our room location. The way the buildings are set up they are scattered on the hotel \u2019s property between the main street of Yountvile Washington Street and busy Route 29 which serve as the boundaries of the property on either side.
