This is a very cute place and very convenient to the middle of UVA you can walk pretty much everywhere from here. That being said that is probably why the prices can be so totally unreasonable for a courtyard of 200 night when there is a game. Also the elliptical needs to be fixed which I reported many times and they had not. The treadmill was also broken. The television did not work at all in the workout room. I am not saying i Need a tv but if it is part of the equipment it should work. There is a small pool a bar and a place to grab a quick bite. However they only serve starbucks. I might be one of the few people who does not like the burned taste of starbucks but I should be able to have a choice. On site parking is great. LATE check in is not so great. All in all it is a cute place to stay but for the price it is not the Ritz.", "offset": [466, 544], "date": "2015-03-26", "cpt": "0", "category": "facility"}, {"id": 2, "uid": "92da4076-3111-4af4-961d-5fb80a46435e", "sentence": "OK nothing great.

Spent a night here had been here a few years ago. when my husband had outpatient procedure done. Location is everything especially in Charlotesvile. This Mariot does not disappoint. Having lived in Cvile for ten years we knew our way around but if not this Mariot is fairly easy to locate. it is on Main Street across from the UVA Battle building. We checked in on the Mariot ap and the keys were waiting at the desk. There is a parking garage but it is narrow so beware if you have a larger SUV. We unloaded our luggage in the garage and used the elevator. Our room was not he 3rd floor with a terrible view of the upper parking garage level but the room itself was clean and reasonably sized. It felt stuffy and the air conditioner is the type under the window which works ok. There are nice convenience features such as plenty of outlets and USB ports for charging. Each room has a fridge and microwave. Our room was quiet and linens and pillows were comfortable. Location is perfect for exploring the Corner or Main Street. We walked to both fairly quickly. There are many restaurants nearby plus there is a coffee bar in the hotel lobby that serves sandwiches and snacks too. We went to the White Spot for breakfast one of our favorites from way back. So good. there is also a CVS on the Corner. We were able to quickly walk across Main St for my husbands apt which was very helpful.

My father was in the hospital having surgery to remove pancreatic cancer that we had just found out about two weeks before. It was a very difficult time.

Carolyn Rush was busily cleaning and preparing to open. Upon my request she immediately turned to begin to pour me a cup of coffee. I began to cry just at the small gesture of kindness.

They kindly listened to me tell them about my father as they worked. A new friendship immediately began. From that moment on and for the rest of the week I looked forward to going out into the lobby early each morning and talking with the women as they worked while I drank my coffee. The circle of friends grew to include Ame Jones and Brittany Casis among many others. They were all so kind. Brittany even wrote us a special note and left it in our room one night.

The rooms have been upgraded but not completely new which was not a problem for us. They had snacks and drinks in the lobby to grab buy and go. In the afternoon they have gratis fresh baked cookies. Plus it was an easy walk to the University stores and a wide variety of food choices. Very friendly and helpful staff. Last but never ever least was the little bar and cafe in the lobby.
