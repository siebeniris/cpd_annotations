We live in Los Angeles but had to tent our house for termites one of the joys of living in Los Angeles. I called around the city to find a good pet friendly hotel that would take our two cats. I must have talked to five pet friendly hotels and each of them required an extra payment up to 100 extra for a pet. and many of them did not accept cats at all. Then I called Kimpton. Not only is the Hotel Wilshire pet friendly but they TRULY treat your four legged friend as if it is a family member and do not charge you a single cent extraBefore we arrived they asked us the names of our cats and asked if we needed anything extra in the room bowls etc. They also mentioned that if we sent them a picture they could frame it for us and have it waiting in the room. Well how could we NOT take advantage of that offer after going through the trauma of packing up for the termite tenting. Upon arrival sure enough there was the sweetest little picture of our kitties sitting on the bedside table. I was so impressed with how much the staff went out of its way to make us feel comfortable in the hotel with our pets. I mean SO impresedOk as for all of the other things hotel related our room was spacious and clean. It overlooked Wilshire Blvd a busy thoroughfare but was surprisingly quiet. Those windows are THICK. The wifi was terrific and the bathrooms were clean and modern. Nothing was dinged or broken or scratched which I found very surprising at a pet friendly hotel. The lobby is clean and inviting and they provide complimentary tea and cold lemonade. The best part of the hotel though is up on the roof. There is a swimming pool along with an amazing 360 degree view of the city. The restaurant was great. We ate there for breakfast lunch and dinner and were very pleased with the food. It was a true staycation and we can not wait to recommend the hotel to our out of town friends and family when they come to visit. And if you have a pet this is the ONLY place to stay. Well done Kimpton.

Game of thrones. This was a nice boutique hotel with a modern and posh touch in the middle of LA. Near Hollywood Beverly Hills museums and much much more. Not near the freeway access or the airport. Room was clean and comfortable. Shower was a light rain spray with all the soaps you need. My one gripe is that the toilet was a small seat. I am 6 250lbs. On vacay. Going out to eat I want a comfortable throne. It was not like the bathroom was so small it needed a small commode. We had our 13 month old with us and it was no issue. Quiet walls and doors. I do not think we kept anyone up and we never heard any of the neighbors except when someone ran down the hallway. One other thing my wife and were concerned about was the floor sometimes seemed to vibrate like a boat or seismic activity. At first I thought it was me after getting off the elevator.

The fries are to die for. The burger was tender and delicious. it is one of those eating experiences you want to do again. The service is a lil slow. I suggest the hotel needs to work on their staffing and the management team needs to keep on top of things if they want to match the atmosphere of the hotel. I will say the morning breakfast bar is very very well done also. My favorite was the yogurt parfaits so good. The coffee was good and included cold press coffee. For being included in the hotel stay it was a very thoughtful arrangement. Again the staff needs to keep up on making sure there are enough plates and coffee for their guests. A couple plates about 5 looks nice but everyone was asking where are the plates. I happened to see the staff take some out of the cabinet below and let other guests know where to get more because hey they were hungry.

Full disclosure I am a Kimpton fanatic and this hotel helps fuel my adictionLocation. Although at first glance this location does not seem to thrill it actually turned about to be quite ideal. it is just a block or two down to the LACMA art museum and La Brea Tar Pits. it is also just a few blocks away from Beverly Hills and Rodeo Drive. We enjoyed the short distance to The Grove where there was a ton of eating and shopping options. The Grounds The first floor lobby is a bit small but it does not skimp on style. it is the perfect preview of what the rest of the hotel has to offer. The second floor lobby has a bit more space and is also where the social hour happens. I enjoyed the different seating vignettes that were available. If you wanted to sit one on one you could socialize you could or even finish off a bit of work you could. Speaking of wine hour awesome. I was surprised how few people showed up for the free wine and finger foods but the selection was great. Also loved that they had nitro cold brew on tapThe Room. We received a complimentary upgrade to a suite just another perk of their great loyalty program and customer service and it was AWESOME. For being such a compact hotel this room was very spacious. King bed that was easy to sleep on. Plenty of lighting. We loved the little seating area with the sectional couch. This came in very handy because we had two friends visit and we did not have to awkwardly sit on our bed we could actually sit on a big couch. The TVs had Google Chromecast built in I am so happy to see this becoming more of a norm and a convenient access panel to plug in a Roku stick or other accessory. The bathroom was also massive. The gigantic tub with a walk in shower next to it was luxurious. And I do not know why the pictures make the decor look so bland it is not that bland in person. Very stylish. We were situated on the front of the hotel and I have heard others concerned for noise from the street. Now you could definitely hear street noise but I did not feel it was as bad as some mention. Anyone who has ever stayed in a hotel in a city should be familiar with the sound. Unles you are a very light sleeper you should be totally fine. The Pool Restaurant. Although we did not utilize the rooftop pool the restaurant basically borders on it. Having dined up there I am not sure how anyone would actually go in. If you gave the slightest splash it would have ended up on someones dinner plate. Ha. So while not ideal for swimming it was wonderful for dining.

They do not have the sun loungers down the side and have replaced them with bar stools. We could not swim as it was like we are in the middle of an exhibition surrounded by tables of people eating.
