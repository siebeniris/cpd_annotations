Following reading another persons helpful review we e mailed the hotel directly and requested a sea view room on the 3 floor and booked the Sunday buffet on Sunday 8 March in the Terrace Restaurant. We booked bed and breakfast. The rooms are amazing large and maintained to a high standard. We had 2 Queen size beds with balcony overlooking the pools and the sea. The bathroom is adequate with shower over the bath. Tip We requested a rubber bath mat from the Hotels service express to save any problems with the glass shower screen. The beds and bed linen pillows etc are so awesome you sleep like a baby. There is a mini bar in the room with drinks and snacks. We ordered an ice bucket from Service express and made our own drinks. Unfortunately the weather was not kind to us so did not have chance to sit on the balcony or use the outdoor pool area What can I say about the food. We had breakfast in the Terrace Restaurant for 7 days it was delicious. The best scrambled eggs I have ever tasted so light and fluffy. The variety of food on display was immense and would please the more picky eater breads cereals meats yoghurt smoked salmon bacon all kinds of eggs omelettes beans tomatoes and fresh fruit. You could even have a sparkling wine to add if required to your fresh orange juice. Now for the Sunday Lunch. We booked this from home and I am so pleased we did. Word has got out to the local Maltese people and the restaurant was busy with beautiful well behaved Maltese families. It was a lovely atmosphere. The food again was amazing so much choice cooked perfectly. There was seafood meats soup salads breads canap\u00e9s cheeses. A whole area dedicated to the most mouth watering desserts and a chocolate fountain heavenThe meal was well priced we had 2 meals a bottle of water and wine. and it came to 80eThe staff could not do enough for you they were an efficient team always willing to help and advise with a smile. The lobby area had a buzz about it with business delegates locals all coming together in it is stunning decor.

I have stayed at well over a thousand hotels across the globe mostly 5 or 4 starred for holidays or work but have never had the time or patience to provide feedback. But the Westin Dragonara in Malta truly deserves a review. I rate in in the top 5 hotels I have visited. And while I will not rate it from 1 to 5 I can say that the other 4 cost me about 10 times more than the Westin in Malta. In purely bricks and mortar terms the hotel is indeed a 5 starer unlike many others which claim to be so. A superb location both in terms of the sea views and the access the local facilities transport connections across beautiful malta gozo combino being within 15 20 minutes of the airport. Very spacious rooms perfectly soundproofed tastefully decorated balconies with stunning views beds you can sink into well equipped and roomy bathrooms a well equipped fitness centre well maintained indoor outdor swimming pools well priced restaurants with authentic food a generous breakfast with the highlight being freshly prepared omelettes made to order. above all the spotless cleanliness which my wife was particularly impressed with. Ignoring all the above what truly sets the Westin Dragonara apart from the best of the rest is the staff at this gem of a hotel.

FULL STOPMy wife I stepped out of the airport taxi to be greeted in seconds by the young Joseph dressed in a crisp uniform who led us to the reception manned by a young lady called Artita. She not only gave us our room keys an hour before our actual check in time but also fiddled around with her computer to give us a high floor room as we requested. In the the next fifteen minutes Stephanie with the lovely eyes sorted out all the queries we had in particular regarding where I could watch the cricket world cup TV coverage. if GOOGLE crashes go to her as she is indeed a mine of information regarding Malta. There was a beautiful young trainee named Nina at reception who was ever so helpful with the minor queries. And Matthew who arranged a late check out in spite of the hotel being full up. And the petite Sophie who was ever so efficient when we were checking out. And last but not the least there was TONY the concierge who was handling affairs in the lobby like a conductor would direct an orchestra. He even has a direct bluetoth connection with the Big Boss up in the heavens can ensure perfect weather during your trip.

A big let down to Starwod which ruined the first 2 days of a short break holiday. I really do not like being disappointed and having expectations trampled on especially when I was really looking forward to staying at this property so I m going to start from the beginning here as it happened. Arriving to the hotel the outside looked great into the lobby wow nice. Check in friendly cheerful fast. I m afraid that Its all downhill from here. We were given a room key to the second floor which did not look appealing to say the least when the lift doors opened. Peeling paint from the walls and what looked like a storage floor for unused furniture. It was very late so we walked to the room and entered. The smell inside was absolutely retching. A damp mould smell that made us both gag instantly. I have recently read other reviews since about the second floor at this hotel so it obviously has notoriety. We went straight back to reception to ask for a room change and were told it was the last room in the entire hotel. I wonder why. It was apparent they knew of its state as they did not even come to look but just said they will try to move us tomorrow and send housekeeping with some air freshener spray before sending us on our way to sleep in it. If it was not passed midnight already we would have just grabbed our luggage and left. We could not even stay in the room waiting for housekeeping and went to stand on the terrace outside to smoke. Within a few minutes a scowling housekeeper arrived with 2 cans of spray walked in glared at me standing on the terrace and blared you have been smoking in the room. What a cheek. she sprayed and marched out of the room. The following morning. we found right outside the room was a playground full of screaming children and to the right. a VERY partial view of the sea through some trees and bushes sea view deluxe. oh please. Day 2 still no apology. After not much sleep we were moved to another sea view deluxe on a higher floor which is like the one they would show on the website or brochure. We were not after an upgrade or a freebie but to place guests or even charge for this room is unconscionable. Even worse was the lack of empathy by reception staff. Nobody cared and a couple of ill let the manager know who we never heard from just made us think less of the whole matter. I did not want to hear about renovation work or blah blah blah anyway. Just simply do not sell a product to people if you have not got your best on offer. In summary the pool area is nice and the lobby is grandeur but I would not return to this hotel again nor recommend it based on our own experience. It was a poor choice made between the Westin and the Radison for this trip. One I will know better next time. We were charged for the first night.

We stayed here recently for a week with our two children in October half term. It is a large hotel set on many floors so if you have mobility issues check on your room as some of them are a fair walk from the main areas. We were in a Luxury Bay suite which consisted of a large entrance hall with a shower room off it a kitchen area room for suitcases very handy lounge area with sofa bed for the kids and a separate bedroom and bathroom for Mum and Dad. Decor was fresh and modern and the space was great. Rooms are well serviced and cleaned every day and the place was spotless. These rooms are on the same floor as reception but a bit of a walk around which we did not find a problem. The hotel itself is on the edge of St Julians and Pacevile which was my only concern before we arrived. It turned out to be no issue at all as the hotel is set on its own peninsula and was very quiet. It has an indoor pool and an outdoor pool outdoor pool was very cold indoor only slightly warmer but we did use this every day. There is no real beach as such it is a deck area set into the rocks and there are steps to get into the sea but not really suitable for young children or people who are not strong swimmers. However just around the corner from the hotel is a public beach and this does have a sandy beach if you want one. Staff are all very helpful and Malcolm the Concierge is a superstar. Thanks also to Mathew for his restaurant suggestions. Breakfast is lovely a very wide buffet selection of everything you could want and there is an omlete and egg station which will cook fresh eggs and omletes for you. Thankyou so much to Horace who was always smiling which was great and he made the best breakfast omletes. My only gripe about breakfast was the coffee. It was terrible. In the bar upstairs they made gorgeous capucinos and lattes and even the filter coffee tastes great. At breakfast you get watery tasting coffee and on the one occasion I asked for a decafinated coffee I was given a sachet of freeze dried Nescafe. Not really what I had hoped for at a luxury hotel so for a coffee fix I ended up at Costa coffee round the corner this could so easily be improved. The restaurants in the hotel are OK we ate at the Italian one on the first night just for ease but there are better places to eat on the island so get out and explore them is my advice. I would stay here again. once they sort the coffee at breakfast out. and would recommend it we had a great week. Only other thing to note is that some rooms come with free wi fi but what they do not tell you is that they have two levels of wi fi. A level suitable for e mails but if you want a better download speed for movies etc you have to pay for this even if you are in a room with free wi fi. I think this could be better explained and for a hotel of this level with these prices I think that in this day and age they have a bit of a nerve charging those rates for wi fi. It did not bother us at all as we just needed e mails but I know plenty of people for whom this would be a deal breaker.", "offset": [2652, 2803], "date": "2015-11-11", "cpt": "1", "category": "price"}, {"id": 12, "uid": "c9aa7d8a-7c05-44e6-af48-fce93da2a735", "sentence": "Perfect seaside location in Malta.

I stayed at the Westin due to a fabulous experience in Thailand. Malta was the last leg of my trip and I decided to spoil myself. Upon arriving I lost my luggage with everything I had been travelling with. I checked in to the hotel and my card was declined as I needed to pay upfront. I could not charge my phone as my charger was in my lost luggage. They could not provide me with a spare iPhone charger even though stated in the amenities list so I could not log on to wifi to transfer money. This also meant I could not buy internet time or put it on my room so I was running around in a circle. I eventually had to reverse charge a call to Australia for family to transfer money from my visa to my travel card. The hotel was extremely unhelpful no internet was offered to help my situation after explaining what had happened. I felt the reception staff were extremely rude short and abrupt in all of their dealings in my week long stay. I was tempted to change my flight to leave after the first two days. I was also locked on my balcony one morning as the doors automatically lock behind you. There was no emergency button or phone outside and as I was on the 3rd floor I had to wait for 2 hours outside until I finally managed to wave down a another guest. This was the WORST experience I have ever had and I wonder the outcome had this guest not have seen me. On day 4 when my luggage was finally delivered they bought it up to my room as I had been down to reception daily distressed.

We stayed as a family in the Westin Dragonara for a week and had a great time. We booked a Luxury Bay Suite which is good for up to four people. It had two baths and a small kitchen. The latter was important for us given that we are traveling with a child and in ALL our research it was hard to understand what it contained. So here it is it comes equipped with a two burner stove a dishwasher and a small fridge that doubles as the mini bar. While we did nt use the stove the other amenities were convenient. The room was well maintained but a little dated. That said the Bay Suite is far larger in dimensions than what we were expecting. In terms of it looking borderline dated we also heard unsolicited that there is a big renovation planned in the next year or two. This is a pleasant surprise since I have been in Starwod Luxury Collection even properties that were in far worse shape before a renovation kicked in. At check in we were initially given a Bay Suite on the first floor which they call a garden view. I expressed my concern right at check in with the trainee since in any other establishment a garden view is less than a water view there was no indication the balcony view on my reservation confirmation can also mean a garden view. Anyway we checked it out and as expected were disappointed and concerned since there were passers by and not secure esp if you have kids. It is convenient if you want to walk to the pool area without having to go through the lobby however you still wo nt get to lock your door from the outside. After bringing it up to the front desk they were able to locate a Bay Suite that was more in line with what we expected. I felt we lucked out since staying here for a week and staring at patchy grass Malta scorches and the neighboring hotels water sports would have made a world of a difference from the priceless view we linger at every morning and evening. I just did not understand why we were given the garden view in the first place if a suite with a real balcony was available. In terms of cuisine we had all our meals at the property with the exception of one dinner in Valetta. We did room service in the earlier part of a trip and they had an excellent selection of small and big plates. Having the extra seating in the bay suite made room service also much easier to manage. We also ordered from the pool side menu while we were on the waterfront and the food there was also pretty good. In terms of restaurants our favorite would be the Boathouse which had the most adventurous menu and very very well done. For desserts the lobby area had the best selection so we would stop by on our way back to our room. The one area that falls short of its peers would be the breakfast buffet. While the buffet selection was very wide and had nice to haves like an omelet station multiple espresso capucino machines interesting offerings like churos and crepes the quality was nowhere as well executed as all other places we have been on on the property. For outdoor features we tried out different parts of the property beyond the resort pools. We visited the small sandy beach the rocky tidepol and the snorkeling areas on different days. The sandy area is compact that can only accommodate a dozen or so recliners. While there seems to always be space the waves in the bay tend to bring in quite a bit of filth into the cove algae seaweed and various garbage in the bay. We preferred the rocky tidepol since it was warm and clean the waves would bring in small fish but not the garbage. We also tried out the snorkeling area which is cordoned off by buoys and the resort built steps to go in and out of the water. The cordon is a good safety feature since the area is right next to the boat dock where you can board water taxis and the waves are sometimes not that gentle that you can get pulled out easily if you are not paying attention. Also wanted to note that the resort designates Adult Only areas for those who want some separation. In terms of in house features the Westin had a great kids club that was very well equipped secure and the staff is professional. They offer interesting activities like sand art and make your own dream catcher. I wished there was a spa in house. with all their offerings onsite including car rental and a beauty salon it suprised me that the property did not have a resort spa. We took advantage of the car service which we highly recommend. We used it to fro the airport and also on our trips to Valetta. It would cost us 20 euro. The drivers are all professional and the cars are clean and impeccable. We thought about the bus which was convenient but we understand it takes double the time and for this reason ruled it out. We also observed that bus stops are always crazy crowded ex while we were in Mdina and we have seen buses at capacity that they can not take all commuters. One tip we wanted to share that was also unknown to the concierge was for cabs leaving Valetta do not board the cabs at the stand on the Kastilja entrance circle. While the Westin concierge advised us on what is a fair rate they do nt have meters say 20 euro the cabbies will try to extort more they will say 25 euro. And some guests even had it worst if you do not say anything they will demand 40 euro. Instead we discovered if you go to the gate around the corner where the bus station is facing the Triton fountain there is a cab kiosk where rates are posted and you pay a cashier before you board the cab. From Valetta to the Westin it is 15 euro. There is also a car rental company on site at the Westin which we think is associated with the car service. It is extremely convenient and we needed to rent a car for a day. We are not sure if we can recommend as I write this review. In all our years renting cars in Europe this is the first time we returned a car and was told that there was damage not visible to the naked eye. The person receiving the car back was shaking a part of the bumper that did not have a scratch on it nor was it dislocated and said it was budging. Since we did not think of shaking the solidity of the various car body parts at receipt since we have nt done that anywhere else in the world we ca nt even figure out what is wrong. As we write this we are still sorting out if they are charging us for damage. The motions of the agent implies that we should be. So at this point if you are heading to the Westin think of other options before you rent onsite. In summary we had a great stay the people were nice the food was good and the property had all possible amenities to make our stay comfortable. We highly recommend for families.", "offset": [5086, 5240], "date": "2017-09-04", "cpt": "1", "category": "price"}, {"id": 15, "uid": "c595624e-cd96-47fc-95bb-46da8cdbd5ad", "sentence": "Beautiful location but extremely high price.

There was a large TV with numerous international channels and a balcony with a table and chairs. The lounge bar is really comfortable and serves an excellent selection of drinks and a good selection of food. Prices are as you would expect in a 5 star hotel.

I understand that In July August there are no conferences.", "offset": [545, 594], "date": "2018-06-21", "cpt": "1", "category": "price"}, {"id": 17, "uid": "6410f858-d024-4431-b544-b4271962f5e5", "sentence": "Rooms not cleaned regularly Dirty bathrooms Phone did n\u2019t workInitialy did n\u2019t give us a sea view room although we paid for it.", "offset": [0, 127], "date": "2018-08-06", "cpt": "1", "category": "price"}, {"id": 18, "uid": "e4677ac2-c872-44db-9605-b68d1183882e", "sentence": "Lovely Hotel. This is a really lovely 5 star hotel which I will summarize as follows ProsRoms are amazing. Large. Spotless. Very comfy beds. Staff are excellent and very friendly in particular Concierge. Great sense of humourChaufeur driven S and E class Mercedes taxis to places like Valletta 20e Water Park and Dolphin Park 15e. Sliema 10eGod pools and access to the sea. On site restaurants in particular Palios next to the sea which is reasonably priced and good for families. Breakfast was the best ever. Self serve but plates cleaned away quickly and choice and quality second to none. Gym was massive and so well equipped. Very friendly polite people stay here. No noise from other rooms round the pools etc. Note can only use inflatables at the family reef pool which allows adults to enjoy the main pool. ConsI know this is 5 star but snacks and drinks throughout the day are very expensive from bars or from hotel shop 5e for an ice cream or can. Small souvenirs double what you pay outside hotel. Recommend you visit the Arcadia supermarket down the road on occasion. Service very slow at pool bar in particular. Waiter service but just wanted a can of drink and was told to take a seat and waited 20 mins for it to arrive. This happened 3 times during the holiday including kids getting very impatient waiting for their ice creams in the heat. Please note that you can use whatsap from your sunbed and wait 20 mins there. Area immediately outside the hotel is not great. Lots of rubbish broken glass and even saw a rat one evening. Felt safe enough but not that suited to families later on with lots of bars night clubs. Some nice restaurants early evening though eg The Avenue but make sure you book the day before unles you want to wait for a table. Top tips Register to become a free spg member before you go. You get a membership number and then free wifi throughout resort and your room. Email hotel 4 weeks before arrival and ask for a fridge and a room on 8th top floor. Nice and quiet and best views. The penthouse is on this floor.", "offset": [814, 956], "date": "2018-08-16", "cpt": "1", "category": "price"}, {"id": 19, "uid": "9dae1792-eafa-4318-a0b6-c5af289e5ff0", "sentence": "I did not stay at this hotel but dealt with management when I had to cancel a non cancelable reservation. We were planning to travel in summer with my mom dad and three young triplet girls and booked two rooms. Last month my 83 year old dad had a stroke and was diagnosed with severe degenerative heart disease. He was told that he had limited time left could no longer travel under any circumstances. I immediately contacted the hotel and offered them his medical records and a doctors letter attesting to this. First I was told the hotel prefers not to give refunds but that we could use the two rooms until the end of 2020 or have some meal credits if we only use one room. I explained that I could not travel alone with three young children and that my dad would never be able to travel again so If possible I would prefer to pay a penalty and have the rest refunded. I was then told that they do not provide refunds under any circumstances but my family could use the rooms till then end of 2021. I was shocked. Given the fact that my dad is dying how was the date extension supposed to help. Was I supposed to bring him after he passed. How would a single dad travel with 7 year old triplets use one room when it exceeded occupancy standards. The tone deaf response from management prompted me to write this review. We have received full or partial refunds from all the other hotels we booked as well as all the flights. The only property not to even try to work with us in a reasonable way was the Westin Dragonara. As a Mariot elite member I am seriously reconsidering my Mariot status if the brand allows its properties to treat loyal customers with such insensitivity. I am sure the hotel is lovely but be forewarned about the hotels extreme cancellation policies and tone deaf management.", "offset": [677, 871], "date": "2020-02-08", "cpt": "1", "category": "price"}]}
