Four days ago my husband was facing a birthday and his professional life was making him very stressed. What to get him for his birthday. My answer was a surprise long weekend in San Juan. To say he went kicking and screaming was an understatement. San Juan because it was one of the few non stop flights in the Caribbean from our home airport in Tampa. I did not want us to spend gobs of time getting there. I chose Dorado because I had spent so much time there as a kid with my family so I knew how beautiful the setting was. The hotel is now run by the Ritz Carlton which is not my first choice for a beach hotel the brands predilection for my grandmothers silk drapes and crystal chandeliers sucks the easy relaxation out of a beach holiday. Love them for their city hotels though. so I was a little worried about my surprise. Wow were those fears unfounded. We were the happy recipients of a whole new brand concept. From the moment we were met at the airport the service was impeccable as one expects from the ritz Carlton. The Mi Casa restaurant fed us exclusively and delightfully for three days. Our personal comprador Jenifer was a delight helping us arrange everything she was only a text away. We stayed in a plunge pool west reserve villa which in addition to the pool allowed us to walk 25 paces to the beach where we found comfortable lounge chairs and a most helpful beach attendant who offered us drinks towels shade and food before we even knew we needed them. We slept every night to the sound of the waves and tree frogs. The hotel itself is modern constructed from organic materials like coral stone and wood and set in a primordial forest which produces a chorus of sounds beginning at sunset. there is plenty to do not just for couples but also for families with kids of all ages. Surfing and kite boarding for the 9 25 year olds a water park for all and of course great golfing. This would be a perfect holiday for extended family. For families that have toddlers there are great facilities for you too my only advice is that you should not book a suite with a pool. The spa is set in an exquisite tropical garden with hot tubs cold plunges and showers. The facilities could occupy the day. The services we received were restorative and memorable. I can not recommend this hotel highly enough. We will be back.", "offset": [2217, 2253], "date": "2015-01-25", "cpt": "0", "category": "facility"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "57552127-8004-43d4-a7d3-b7223088ae3c", "sentence": "Pampering in paradise. We just returned from 8 days at the Ritz Carlton Dorado Beach in Puerto Rico. The first 6 days were AWESOME as the resort was very quiet we were told only 40 occupancy. Things changed the last 2 days as a big group arrived but were still good. The staff is wonderful going out of their way to help out in any manner and usually addressing us personally by name. The property is huge and we took advantage of the free bike loan to get around. there is a nice nature trail with 2 separate loops in which to run or ride. We loved the fitness center at the resort but know that there is a larger fitness center with regular classes on the other side of the golf course accessible by bike or complementary golf cart ride. We often judge resorts by their fitness centers and this was one of the best. All the guest rooms open to the ocean view which is just breathtaking. We had a first floor plunge pool room and it was nice to have our own little infinity pool. The beach is very nice with a rocky breakwater that helps to create a protected lagoon. The sailing beach is on the far end of the property not on the main beach like in St Thomas so we did not use it. There is also a water park on the property on the far side of the golf course. It is only open on Saturdays and Sundays. it is free to hotel guests and the staff there are great about handing out towels. We enjoyed the lazy river and the 2 water slides. There are also some nice areas for families with small children. There are technically 6 restaurants on the property but one is at the sailing beach and closes early another is a take out place for lunch and also has ice cream and frozen yogurt and one is on the other side of the property in the golf club. We ate at all the restaurants and they were OK would not rave about any of them. A little disappointed in their wine lists. As expected they were all pricey. We took cabs must call ahead or have concierge reserve as they do not linger near the property to restaurants in the town of Dorado which were better priced and had good food. Even though it was a quiet week we made reservations for all restaurants on and off property as advised by the concierge. The one downside of the hotel is there is not a true hotel gift shop with logo gear toiletries candy magazines snacks. Suffice it to say we loved the resort so much we only left the property for a few dinners. This is a high end Ritz Carlton so it was very pricey but for us it was worth the money.", "offset": [2201, 2319], "date": "2015-02-01", "cpt": "0", "category": "facility"}, {"id": 2, "uid": "af83e3e1-3674-4baa-af95-c2a8b2fae478", "sentence": "Great expecations and big disappointments.

Nickeling and diming people who can afford to stay anywhere they Iike is a recipe for disaster in any business much less the hospitality resort business. Such is the case I experienced at the Dorado Beach Ritz Carolton. Upon arrival the resort appeared to be world class. The architecture tropical landscape design were all amazing. The arrival procedure was also a pleasant experience as we were greeted by a staff of 3 waiting with cold coconut Popsicles and welcome introductions. The entry and reception area alerts one that this place is special with tropical flora and incredible water features all designed to visually mimic a lush antique sugar plantation. We were then introduced to our designated butler and whisked away to our room via golf cart. there are no motorized vechiles on this ECO resort. When the door opened to the room I knew we would be staying in the lap of luxury. The interior decor was amazing and the suite was spacious. The view to the ocean was unveiled as the floor to ceiling glass doors all folded back into the wall opening the outdoors in. The private patio with infinity plunge pool was perfect and gave view to a lush grass lawn landscaped perfectly with the ocean crashing on the rocks passed the private beach and saltwater lagoon. We had arrived at paradise. That evening we took our first outing at one of the resorts three dining establishments. It was right on the beach and again the decoration was perfect and the view inspiring. Then the menus came and we were surprised. Sushi. In Puerto Rico. Really. Ok well we dug in and ordered the same sushi that we get back home only a lot more expensive taking a lot more time to get and while waiting drinking cocktails that started at 20. first red flagDay one one the beach perfect. Very private and exclusive feeling. Our own terry covered lounges under an umbrella steps from our suite and plunge pool. The view is spectacular as are the sounds of the surf crashing over the rocks. We are sitting on a beach and in front of us is a man made saltwater lagoon that has perfect sand bottom at varying depths. This water is gin clear and a beautiful shade of turquoise. Perfect for swimming and Sunning. Now lunch at the second dining establishment on the resort sort of a pool sand side grill. burgers pizza but also some limited main course items and a full bar. We decided on a Cuba Libre and Pi\u00f1a Colota with two sandwiches. It took forever to get our order even though there was very few people in the restaurant. The drinks were lite of rum and the menu was just average pool food. I had to flag down the waiter to finally get our bill so we could pay and get back to the beach. The bill came and was 1370 for two drinks and two sandwiches. second red flag. We went to the spa for treatments and were completely amazed by this place. world class does not describe the art and architecture. almost Disney like for adults good. I have never experienced the visual sense that this spa exudes again thanks to the amazing architects and designers. But again once past the facade the massage treatments were average at best and the prices were double any other world class spa that I have been to. Third red flag. The next day repeat day one. Beach and swimming in the lagoon. Took bike rides along the 11 mile Rockefeller trail which was very nice and beautiful scenery. You really get a sense of the entire property by bike. That afternoon I decided that I wanted my own bottle of rum in the room so I did not have to keep trying to find a butler who assured me would be at my every be on command could not even get him to deliver ice cokes limes or even get our turn down service correct. but he put on a convincing show upon our arrival. None the less he told me of Puerto Ricos finest and most coveted Rum. Don Q and that I should experience this fine liquor. so I called him up and had a bottle delivered with cokes and limes. Again it was average at best and I was charged 2470 for the bottle. Being a drinker of fine single malt whiskeys and small batch bourbons I was ignorant and felt price must be inline with fine Rum. fast forward to leaving the island and at the airport. The shop at the airport was selling THE EXACT SAME BOTTLE OF DON Q RUM FOR 140 USD. Fourth red flag and now I am furiousOh and I forgot to tell you that the incidentals not including room tax or transfers came to 3800. Over 1000 was Spa treatments but the rest was nickel and dime charges delivery fees gratuity and many other unknown charges that should have been included when spending 1400 per night for a room with a view. Summary Is the Dorado Beach Resort by Ritz Carlton a beautiful and visually amazing place. YESWould I ever stay they again. NO WAYDoes this property measure up to other properties in this price range like Las Ventanas in Cabo or the Anangati in Jackson Hole. In beauty yes in service integrity and food service not even closeSo be warned this place is a wolf in sheeps clothing. Shame on Ritz Carlton management for these less than professional tactics.

Just returned from 5 night stay. The resort is absolutely beautiful. We chose it mainly for the golf and the beach. The golf was great we played both courses. Our accommodations on the West beach were spectacular and no complaints about housekeeping. We ate at all the restaurants but preferred the food and service at COA. We had dinner our last night at Melao which was touted as their \u201c fine dining \u201d restaurant. We were very disappointed. The restaurant was not elegant tables too close together no table clothes and service was very slow. The staff who were working at the resort before the hurricane in 2017 were very good. Noel our Butler was excellent and made up for all the glitches in reservations for tee times. Arelis at COA was terrific. The newer staff members post hurricane try hard but they just do n\u2019t have it working quite right. More training is definitely needed. And 20 minute wait for a drink at the pool is unacceptable. The spa is the best I \u2019ve ever seen. Stunning setting and great massage. Lastly if you are a couple looking for a romantic getaway be advised that there are families with very young children at this resort. I would go back but not until the service is up to par for a Ritz property.", "offset": [209, 300], "date": "2019-02-14", "cpt": "1", "category": "facility"}, {"id": 17, "uid": "b4234ba5-6b14-4582-9138-e38d75094efa", "sentence": "PARADISE GETAWAY. My wife and I just came back from an incredible week in paradise. The Dorado Beach a Ritz Carlton Reserve is a hidden gem in the Caribbean. The resort was rebuilt and reopened towards the end of last year after hurricane Maria. It is located about 40 minutes away from San Juan \u2019s International Airport. We rented a 2019 Jeep Wrangler as we were concerned about the pot holes and state of the roads in Puerto Rico like many other reviewers noted. In retrospect the roads were not as bad as portrayed and a simple car would have sufficed as we have seen worse roads and streets in some major cities in the US. Once we reached the hotel we were greeted at the arrival area by the hotel staff who were elegantly dressed and our own personal Ambassador. We were offered delicious fruit popsicles as we toured the property and escorted to our suite. Our beachfront room was AMAZING. Incredible views of the ocean. One of the things we loved the most was the outside shower. The beach is gorgeous and the resort \u2019s landscaping is breathtaking and well manicured. Make sure you take advantage of the bicycles provided and explore the Rockefeller trail. The blue segment will take you through a mesmerizing ride by the beach wood reservoir golf course and luxurious residences within the Dorado Beach property. The blue trail will also take you to the main gym. This facility is nestled in a old traditional plantation hangar that has been revamped for this purpose. The old and classic architecture combined with the ultramodern exercise equipment just blends perfectly. This has to be one of the most beautiful gyms we have ever seen and we used it everyday during our stay. We are \u201c foodies \u201d ourselves and both restaurants \u201c Coa \u201d and \u201c Positivo \u201d are top notch. Positivo has an outdoor setting with amazing beach views. We were given a romantic table overlooking the water which was a few feet away from the shore. The only negative thing was that in the evening the restaurant ambience is dark and made enjoying the beautiful presentation of the dishes difficult. We had to read the menu using the light of our cell phones. For this reason when we returned the second time we asked for a table that was closer to the bar with better lighting. We enjoyed amazing breakfast at Coa with a breathtaking view of the beach every morning after our workouts. The staff and the waiters were always attentive prompt and kind. By the second day they all knew our names. A special thanks to Michael our waiter at Coa for making the mornings extra special. You have to try the \u201c organic a\u00e7a\u00ed bowl \u201d and the specialty juices I loved the Restore and my wife the Energize. We found out that the Positivo side of the resort was more private and quieter. It even has an adult only hot tub with a nice cold plunge next to infinity pools which is absolutely beautiful and always at the perfect temperature. Here in this oasis is were the service was impeccable. The pool and cabana staff would greet you with your own tray with fresh cold ginger and lemon scented towels sunblock ice cold bottled water Evian facial spray and a basket weaved personal fan. Special thanks to Gabriel and Luis for always making us feel special. Gabriel recommended the coconut mojito I enjoyed the frozen one and my wife the on the rocks version. The award winning bartender Angel even taught us how to prepare them this will for sure become our signature drinks at parties back home. We booked a snorkeling excursion with the Jean Michel Cousteau \u2019s Ambassadors of the Environment Sarah and Savi which were our instructors. Very attentive and patient they brought water and snacks on our trip and made sure we knew how to use the equipment prior to our adventure. Our equipment was top notch and brand new. We had the opportunity to try the full face mask for snorkeling which was amazing. The resort is beautiful and the restaurants outstanding so that you do not have to leave the property but my wife and I like to explore and since we rented the Jeep we asked for recommendations to local restaurants. First we tried Katrina. This restaurant is very casual with authentic Puerto Rican food. Excellent. Next we went to Grappa which was a delicious Italian restaurant with Puerto Rican influence. The four cheese pork lasagna was amazing. The wine list was very decent. Another night we ventured to Old San Juan as we made a reservation at what we were told was the best restaurant in Puerto Rico \u201c Marmalade \u201d. This place has nothing to envy to a Michelin Star quality restaurant and on its own merit has been recognized with top notch awards. We chose the six course menu with the wine pairing and was sublime. At the end of our meal we got to meet the chef Peter Schintler. He was very kind and gracious. Made the night extra special. Back at the hotel the ambassadors would text us everyday to let us know they were available for whatever we needed. We never had any problems reaching them. Now if you come to the Dorado Beach Ritz Carlton Reserve and you do not book an appointment at the Spa Bot\u00e1nico you are missing out on what is without a doubt the most amazing spa we have ever been at. A mistake on our part we did not book our session right away and most of the appointments were taken but the Ambassadors made it work. This Spa is expensive but just like most things in life you get what you pay for. We decided for a couples Dorado Beach deluxe treatment this goes for about 120 but we were celebrating our Anniversary and decided to splurge on it. Our treatment was scheduled for 120 minutes but we were told to arrive there early to enjoy the spa amenities so we were there for close to 4 hours including some down time after the session. Although we had our treatment together as a couple the spa is divided into male and female sections since clothing is optional. This experience at Bot\u00e1nico was the highlight of our tripMake no mistake this resort is ultra luxurious and exclusive. If you pay close attention you will notice the Hollywood \u201c A \u201d listers vacationing with you at the pool and at the beach just a few chairs away. Names are not mentioned to respect their privacy. We are definitely thinking on coming back and as a matter of a fact we are determined to go to all 5 Ritz Carlton Reserves around the world. If you need more information about this place go to the points guy review of this resort. well worth the read. In summary if you can afford it do not hesitate and book your vacation in heaven.", "offset": [1477, 1581], "date": "2019-08-04", "cpt": "1", "category": "facility"}, {"id": 18, "uid": "0857fe1b-0cdd-46d8-80b8-8e593e2c05c7", "sentence": "Above the rest A unique reserve hotel.
