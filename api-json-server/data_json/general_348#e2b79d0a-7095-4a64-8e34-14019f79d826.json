This hotel is under new management and undergoing renovations. Our room was a bit outdated but clean. You can tell there has been a lot of effort by the new team to change the look and atmosphere of the hotel. We had an issue with the plumbing in our room and were floored by the effort management took to amend things for us. We were fortunate enough to be able to be moved to one of their new concept rooms. It was absolutely gorgeous. I ca nt say enough about it. It had a cool modern industrial look and amazing details. I also love that all the rooms are set back from the hallway cutting out traffic noise from the hall.

I needed a room at the last minute late in the evening on a Saturday so I called Expedia. The hotels I would normally frequent were all booked so the Rep recommended The CorkTown Hotel. I asked about the rating and he told me it was good. When I arrived at the hotel the lights in the sign for the name of the hotel were out there was a gate that you had to go through to get to the parking area and there were security cameras all around the entrance to the lobby. I saw a couple people go into the lobby and they had to use there key cards to get in or were buzzed in. As I was about to walk into the lobby I noticed that the receptionist appeared to be sitting behind what looked like a plexi glass partition of some kind. At that site I turned around. In all fairness I can not rate the staff or the conditions of the room so I simply put OK for those ratings. But from the curb appeal I would not recommend this hotel. I did not like the initial curb appeal and did not go any further than that. Not far from downtown but apparently not the best of neighborhoods.

This is a nice refurbished hotel in the Corktown District. Plenty within walking distance to eat drink and listen to. Just head up to Michigan Ave. Room was pretty quiet with some building noises indeterminate HVAC or other mechanical sounds. This is something I noticed in another refurbished property the Verb in Boston though this place was much quieter. Bed very firm I liked it and slept well. Pillows were full and plush. Bathroom was very clean upon arrival. Duvet cover was something I had have at home no cheap polyester. Mini fridge was clean and empty so I could put purchases in there. No minibar situation. so over that anyways. Blinds blocked out the sun so I could sleep late. The first two floors are not refurbished yet but they are not renting those floors so it does not matter. If you end up on one it just shows you the before and after. Carpet and paint choices matter quite a bitI take off one star for not having some kind of free coffee or coffee in the room. Not to be a fusbudget but I am not always in a good space for interacting with people until I have had a cup of coffee. Even some kind of instant option would be nice. I do not care I need hot caffeine before talkingCofe is available for purchase at 20 for a 12 oz cup. I did buy those and they were good strong coffee.
