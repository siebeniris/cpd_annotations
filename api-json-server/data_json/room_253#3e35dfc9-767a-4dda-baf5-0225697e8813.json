Included was also 2 hrs each evening in the executive lounge of all alcoholic drinks and Canap\u00e9s which was great way to finish the night.

I can not say enough about the incredible staff at this hotel. My parents were celebrating their 60th Wedding Anniversary and I was lucky enough to win a weekend stay at the Brisbane Mariot. My parents were treated like royalty from the moment we arrived. The reception staff went over and above to make sure my elderly parents were comfortable with their surroundings explaining any concerns they may have had. They had a view of the Brisbane River and their room was clean and comfortable. There was a king size bed a writing desk and chair as well as a small table with 2 sitting chairsthere is adequate hanging space. The bathroom had a bath as well as a walk in shower. Once we were settled the Hotel sent a bottle of champagne a small anniversary cake for them to share as well as some chocolates. They were so grateful and the goodies were delicious. My parents opted for the Buffet breakfast each morning which they said was delicious and had a good selection. We also used the valet parking as it is difficult trying to park in the street due to lack of spaces available. The hotel is located within walking distance aprox 7 min walk of the Riverside City Cat Terminal. Tickets can be purchased on board. This is great way to see the river. Overall I would recommend this hotel to anyone wanting to visit Brisbane. It is on the edge of the CBD which makes it slightly quieter but if you do not mind a pleasant 15 20 minute walk through the streets or along the waterfront to the hub of the city this place is for you. There is also a free city loop bus which leaves from Cnr Adelaide and Wharf Streets every 10 minutes which is another option. This service only operates Monday Friday last time I used it. Once again to all staff here thank you so much for looking after my parents so well.

The only negative during the entire stay was wanting to eat breakfast at 630am and the restaurant not being open. They operate from 7 am onward. Which for most people is quite late.
