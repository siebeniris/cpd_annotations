I am a Phily girl so staying in a Philadelphia hotel hardly ever happens. But we stayed here for two nights with some out of town friends and I was pleasantly surprised. We stayed in rooms 2016 and 2017. both had great views only 2017 was way better with the view of the parkway. You could see City Hall and Wiliam Penn from 2016. Both rooms had two double beds. I realized after the first night that the beds were not equals. The bed closest to the bathroom was a thick luxury mattress 17 pillow top whereas the bed by the window was not. It was just a regular mattress and nothing great. I thought it was funny because the first night I stayed in the bed by the window and my son took the one by the bathroom. I am lying in bed in the middle of the night thinking. Sheraton is known for their beds. but this is not great at all. ugh. And then I realized the next morning what had happened and kicked my kid out of the luxury bed. lol. We ate breakfast on both days at the hotel once in the Terrace with coupons which was great. Lots of options and the waiters really doted on us giving us tips for our day and bringing a special waffle for the kids even though it looked closed at the buffet. It was a great breakfast. The 2nd day we ate breakfast on the club level and were not impressed. Much smaller selection of food the eggs were bad and honestly I thought the room kind of smelled. It is a small room up there on the 26th floor. but the view the view from the club was great. It rained on our last day and the front desk gave us umbrellas when they saw we were going out how nice is that. Overall the service was top notch at this hotel. I felt like everyone working there was happy to be there and wanted to help us. I appreciate that more than a nice bed.

Also whatever type of emergency happened in the pool I do not want to knowIt was only 100 for a standard double room for a Saturday night which is a really great deal for the central location not to mention for the day after the inauguration when the Womens March took place directly on the parkway although we did book it a month prior. Our view was great with the parkway and gorgeous church right in front of us. However I will say at 100 you get what you pay for. If you are looking for something cheap and central for touristy stuff this location is prime literally 10 20 minute walk in any direction and you will hit something good Art Museum Franklin Institute Free Library Academy of Natural Sciences Reading Terminal Market Chinatown Dilworth Park center city shops restaurants Spring Garden Fairmount neighborhood etc. For a one night stop it is not that terrible hence the average rating but I am giving it the benefit of the doubt here. I would not recommend it if you are seeking some baler luxurious bachelor weekend. the hotel itself needs some work. To break it down the underground parking lot was SO dark and dingy with no lighting that I felt like I was gon na get robbed it was like a straight up coal mine down there.

Someone who had the wrong room decided to bang repeatedly on our door at 4 AMthe ice machine on our floor was broken so we took the stairwell to the floor below us where we discovered a luckily empty mouse trap chilling behind the exposed hot water heater. Lastly the bathroom was fairly clean but when I was brushing my teeth I heard a weird paper scraping sound to discover that some random section of unmatched wall protruding out from under the sink had come undone from the MASKING TAPE holding it up. Like wtf. I was too scared to see what was behind there but we joked it was obviously surveillance cameras. Who knows what it was but I would have done more than just slap masking tape on that bad boy. The lobby area itself seems very wide open bright and clean and the gift shop had a lot of cute stuff.
