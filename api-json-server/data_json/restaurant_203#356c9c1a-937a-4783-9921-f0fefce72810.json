I knew it was going to be a great trip when we were greeted by Ben in the courtyard. He was very jolly and welcoming and informed us that with a quick walk to the pier we could still catch the fireworks after we checked in. At the front desk we were greeted by Julian who could not be nicer. He sent a nice welcome note happy birthday card and a dish of fresh fruit to our room. I knew this was the best place for us for this Chicago TripPrior to check in we contacted in house reservations Amy. who suggested our room letting us know it would be the best for my husband myself and my teenage son. It was a king with a pull out queen sofa. We also confirmed our reservation online and requested 2 extra pillows and 2 extra towels. When we opened the door to our room I immediately knew Amy never had a teenage son. The room was pleasant enough but small. When we unpacked our clothes there were two items of under garments left in a drawer. Also there were no extra pillows or towels that we requested nor were there any blankets for the pull out sofa. The bathroom was in need of a remodel the TP holder was falling off the wall the wallpaper was in disrepair. The phone in the room never worked correctly even after service had been there to repair it twice. Ben was correct it was a 5 minute walk to the pier and the hotel is in a great location walking distance to the miracle mile or a very short cab ride to other areas of Chicago. Kimberly at the Concierge Desk also worked hard and hooked us up with great tickets to see Kinky Boots dinner reservations at RPM Italian and a great driver to take us to White Sox Stadium. The pool area was great on the roof of the 5th floor.", "offset": [386, 472], "date": "2015-07-20", "cpt": "0", "category": "restaurant"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "3d68fe18-2487-4c30-a16e-9c19832578b6", "sentence": "Great chicago.

To say my experience at this establishment was abhorrent would not begin to cover the awful weekend that this hotel specifically Michael Brown did to me and the group I was with. After traveling to Chicago for a celebration with 10 other women the woman who checked us in at the hotel was lovely and even sent up champagne to celebrate the occasion. We went up to our rooms and gathered in the middle of the three rooms we rented. Then a mere 4 hours later we received a knock on the door from hotel security telling us there was a noise complaint and to be quiet. After we actively worked on reducing our noise level however just 45 minutes later we had another knock on the door at 1030pm on a Friday. We were greeted by the same hotel security man along with 6 Chicago police officers in bullet proofs vests the hotel told the police we had 40 people when they knew there were only 11 of us who told us we had to collect our belongings and leave because we were n\u2019t quiet enough. Yes after one in person warning we were being evicted from the hotel rooms we paid for. We asked to speak to the manager Michael Brown to discuss our options and ultimately see if we could be refunded. Mr Brown arrived and refused to engage in discussion about the situation. I \u2019ve never seen anyone hospitality industry acted so rude unprofessional. It bogles the mind. After asking the front desk about their noise policy they admitted it was a one strike subjective policy. Once again I struggle to understand how a corporation deems this acceptable. The next day we called to check on our hotel reservations and everything seemed fine. We received new keys went to our original rooms got ready for dinner and left the hotel. We returned the hotel to find all of our belongs in trash bags outside of the rooms. The hotel did n\u2019t even have the decency to call us to warn us. Naturally Mr Brown was the manager again. I will never stay at a DoubleTree or a Hilton again.
