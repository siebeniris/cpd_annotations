This is an awesome place to stay. The hotel is close to everything you could want andor need. I was a bit doubtful about staying downtown but this was the best decision ever.

The valet team was the best and offered great recommendations on things to do in the area. I am thinking of visiting again in the next couple of months and will definitely book here. The hotel staff was amazing. Dalton is a great representation of how customer service should be done. The rooms were comfortable and quiet.

OK stay. This was my 2nd stay at this property. The first time was much better. This time I thought the housekeeping team was really lacking. A posted note stated that due to conservation sheets would not be changed every day but would be on the second day. Mine were never changed and I was there 4 nights. I know this because of a mascara stain on the fitted sheet that was there every night. By the time I saw it at night I was ready for bed and not willing to get re dressed for housekeeping to come change the linens. I saw a housekeeper on the morning on my 3rd day and she said they would be changed. NOPE. Same stain on the sheet. It was now Thanksgiving and I think most of the staff was sent home. The bathroom counter was not even wiped down that day. The room was VERY dusty. Stains could be seen on the wallpaper in the bathroom and the bedroom area. Refrigerator in the cabinet was not installed properly and wobbled any time the cabinet was opened. Location perfect to get anywhere in the city. Starbucks TVs in the lobby are great. View from revolving bar restaurant on the top floor is awesome Location is the prime reason I stayed here. The skywalk to the mall restaurants and other hotels is SO convenient.

The location is nice and some of the staff was very helpful. Specially John. He helped us get our bags ready when we had to move rooms. They are currently doing construction and renovating some of the rooms but they do not tell you that when you are checking in. So if you think you can sleep in you are wrong. Lol8am on a Saturday they are hammering every inch of every wall. And just when I thought maybe Sunday it would be better since it \u2019s the Lords day and maybe the construction guys will have the day off. No. They brought drills this time. You \u2019d think you are in the same room as them. That \u2019s how loud it was. When I called the front desk the guy said to me \u201c well we are lucky they started at 9 bc they wanted to start at 8. But check out is in just 3 hours so I do n\u2019t think you want to move rooms because there \u2019s no point \u201d. for the 300 you charge for 2 nights you better move me to another room right now and I \u2019m getting my three hours of sleep.

I typically stay at a Hyat property only once a year. More often I stay in lodging that is perhaps a tier below the typical Hyat. So I expected a lot more this time while staying at the Hyat.

I was not able to control the temperature in my room I asked for foam pillows but received feather or feather like pillows and the humidifier I requested was filthy. About the only thing that was better than expected was the valet service. Perhaps the worst aspects are that the shower faucet did not work properly and it was nearly impossible to control the water temperature. In addition this is an atrium style hotel and there were guests screaming as they came in at 4 am from partying. The echoes likely woke anyone who was sleeping.
