Our room was what one would expect from a Kimpton super clean nicely decorated and very comfortable. The hotel is in a great location on 46th Street near Times Square close to theaters restaurants and key NYC sights.

The breakfast staff on our last morning were very friendly and attentive. Based on the hotel reviews we were looking forward to staying here unfortunately from that point onwards the service received at this hotel is the worst I have received in all hotels I have ever stayed at plus the breakfast prices are extortionate for the available food options. My partner returned to the hotel to check in alone but the check in service was awful. My gf was simply given the room key no friendly welcome and no information about the hotel amenities or area. Instead of offering any assistance with the two luggage bags she was simply told the room number. When I arrived to the counter I explained it was my partners 21st Bday and thought it would be nice if we could return to the room after midnight with the balloons banner and cake I had just bought. we have stayed at so many hotels where they go out of their way to help celebrate anniversaries and birthdays yet this is the ONLY hotel where they wanted to charge a rediculous amount of money just to put some balloons in a room. I did not feel like a valued customer at all. One evening we noticed the fire alarm must have been faulty or running low on battery because it was periodically beeping loudly. I asked if it could be looked at but at 050 in the morning the beeping started again. When I spoke to the staff in the morning I was reassured the issue would be fixed the second time. When we returned to the room in the evening we noticed they had simply removed our ceiling fire alarm and one was not replaced for the remainder of our stay. I was delighted to hear I had 50 dollars of credit left on our last morning one of the things we never knew about because the staff never told us we had 10 dollars of credit per night. So on our last morning I thought we had have breakfast at the hotel. I was surprised for the 2 of us the 50 dollars still did not cover breakfast and we would have to pay an additional 13 dollars because of the additional charges the breakfast food options at this hotel are seriously limited for what they charge you.

We love Kimpton properties. we have stayed in a lot around the USA and always have a good experience.

Great location. but as the building is old the sound proofing compared to purpose built modern hotels is not great. We could hear noise from Times Square all night. If you need quiet to sleep you may prefer a modern hotel. We love the wine hour it is a great chance to chat to other visitors. However you have to pay a 30 resort fee per day which apparently covers wifi normally 149 according to their website. You are told that 10 will be deducted from your mini bar or bar bill as part of this but as a bottle of water costs 10 there is not really much you can get from the mini bar without spending more money. I prefered when they used to give the 10 voucher and free wifi as part of the loyalty programme as it felt like something special. It seems a rip off and a way to have slightly cheaper rates. The service was great but a constant issue with all of the hotels on this trip was not preparing for the number of guests on the booking. Why ask how many people in the room if you are not going to provide the correct number of towels etc. We had to ask for more towels on both nights we stayed. it is still a lovely hotel and we enjoyed our stay but it did not seem like the Kimptons we have stayed in in other US locations.", "offset": [659, 861], "date": "2019-09-15", "cpt": "1", "category": "restaurant"}, {"id": 16, "uid": "b8005e40-ac45-4292-a528-dcb735e9b725", "sentence": "Moldy Food Mediocre Service.
