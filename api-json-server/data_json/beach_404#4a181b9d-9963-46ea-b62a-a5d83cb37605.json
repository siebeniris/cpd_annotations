We were just at the hotel. I had read the reviews prior to leaving home and came. this close to changing hotels but figured I would take my chance here. It was cheaper getting to the hotel by taxi than anticipated. 10 base 2 airport fee 1 state fee 1 bag. It \u2019s still overpriced when in most other cities the 3 miles would have been covered by a hotel shuttle the policies here stink but not the hotels \u2019 fault directly. I will complement the lobby and grounds for being beautiful. However upon arrival we were immediately met by the protestors \u2019 chants in front of the hotel. They have an entire section of the sidewalk apron blocked off for them to house their tents vehicles etc \u2026 basicaly a base camp so they \u2019re not going away anytime soon. Until hearing their bullhorn and loudspeakers it \u2019s extremely hard to envision the sheer amount of noise they create until experiencing it in person. I will say that some of their chants were actually melodic and not too disturbing however not when heard early in the morning or late at night. The mind blowing thing though is that upon check in I mentioned reading about the protestors on TA the hotel staff 3 different staff members 2 guys in pinstripe jackets 1 girl insisted that the front protestors had simmered down and guaranteed that there were no as in ZERO. protestors on the beach anymore. They even recommended that I submit this review as a revision of the prior ones letting people know this. THIS WAS A LIE. Indeed protestors continue on the beach as I type this. Mind you it \u2019s not 12 hours a day and not at the crack of dawn or late evening. However 100 they still exist and have their tent set up just outside the eastern entrance to the pool area. Luckily we barely heard their noise as I was in a high enough room. Additionally the hotel tried to drown them out by cranking up the music playing around the pool area but that was only successful if staying by the pool closest to the hotel entrance. Bottom line \u2026 protestors continue both in front and in back of the hotel. Construction continues. They \u2019re still working on the new fitness spa area and I \u2019m not sure if that \u2019s the noise we heard but we were awoken the first morning at 9 am by the sounds of drilling or maybe a jackhammer. So much for sleeping in on vacation. The other days it has n\u2019t been as bad though. There is a convention here this week. The attendees are n\u2019t too bad \u2026. a bunch of old men having fun getting drunk by the pool. Some have brought their families but most are flying solo and living it up. They were mostly well behaved and I was n\u2019t too concerned with them being around children. However the pool and bar staff are clearly catering to them as we were left sitting by the pool for at least 10 15 minutes before getting any drink that was ordered. They also dominated the pool area and indoor spaces for several of their events. It was n\u2019t too bad but just something to note. Upon check in we were advised of a Sunday pool party. We were at the pool from 10 1 then 2 4 yesterday and there was n\u2019t a hint of a pool party anywhere to be seen. We were actually looking forward to it but \u2026. While we \u2019re on the pool topic \u2026 chair hogs are in full force. You know \u2026 those people that get up put their towels on the chairs and then disappear for hours. Between the convention folks and the moronic chair hogs it was tough to find a spot. Staff tried to be helpful in pulling extra chairs from cabanas but there \u2019s only so much real estate to cover. The beach area was easier to get a seat as staff would bring out a chair from the stack if one on the beach was n\u2019t available. The only issue with the beach besides the protestors is that the beautiful sand is fine and with the wind it tended to fly in our face quite frequently. The beach area is clean beautiful though. It has many activities in the immediate area for hire jet ski parasail etc \u2026. All in all it has been a decent experience. The hotel is in a nice location for outside food choices Chilis most fast food options and several local fare options as well if not wanting to pay exorbitant hotel prices and a good base camp for excursions to other parts of the island. The only other interesting tidbit \u2026 there are 3 guys here presumably guests but they seem to know much of the staff as they are greeting them with handclasps and bro hugs. Each has a different hair color red blue and brown and one is wearing a court ordered ankle monitoring device.

I have never experienced this in the south before. We always enjoy relaxing on the balcony in the mornings but we were not able to do this here. Bed was very comfortable for sleeping but our backs were sore all week. Not sure if it was from the bed or not. Lots of closet space for your clothes and a nice sized fridge to keep your beverages cold. It was a little larger than the average hotel fridge. A C worked great. Room was quiet. Loved that there were upgraded electrical outlets on both sides of the king bed with USB ports every hotel should have these nowadays. Bathroom was small but very clean and great lighting. The hotel is still renovating it is shopping area so only a few restaurants are open. We ate at the Pizzeria one evening. It was pretty good for a meal but I would not rush to go back. Outside there is a pool side restaurant open for breakfast lunch and dinner. Breakfast here is a buffet and it is really good but also quite expensive as a breakfast. We found a little place 5 minute walk away that made a great traditional breakfast for 6. can not remember the name but when you head out front go left a couple places past the Mexican restaurant. Lunch pool side was delicious. Really enjoyed the salads and fish tacos. The menu for this restaurant is offered polside at the quiet pool. The bar pool has a different menu which is refreshing not to have the same thing every day. Love the options. We never ate at the Meat Market. We chose to eat at the neighbouring hotel at the Ruths Chris Steakhouse instead. Pools are lovely. Never had issues finding chairs. Towel service here is by far the best at any hotel I have ever been to. They offer you a white Terry cloth chair cover plus a towel. I have stayed at some really high end resorts and never have I been offered a chair cover. Much more sanitary. No towel cards but they do ask your room number to ensure you are a guest at the hotel. The pool waiters are a fabulous group of staff. Super friendly remember your name and make sure you are taken care of. Drinks are expensive but they are delicious. One of the best Mojitos I have had. The downside of this resort is the protests out front and on the beach. Yes at times they can be noisy but I refused to let it ruin my stay. They can get pretty noisy around the bar pool but it was never constant. Usually about 5 minutes every hour while we were there. It was more annoying the one day that they were running tsunami alarm tests about every 30 minutes. That was not the hotel though so beyond their control. Never made it to the beach. Beach was clean but the water was full of seaweed. More than I would care to swim in. Another downside is the area this hotel is in. The area is a little run down with not much to offer in walking distance.

Because we all want a good clean hotel. El San Juan Hotel was awesome. We were greated by Jose Rios at the front desk and he was superb. What a super nice guy. We were upgrated to a pool villa which was awesome. The premisis is clean and everyone is super nice. All but one security guard. HaHa. We also met Cyndi Mar Mejias at the conciere desk and she and Jose gave us great tips on where to eat and go. So we do not get caught in the tourist trap resturants. I could not have asked for better service. Hilton you hired great people at this hotel. Even the guys on the beach would get your beach chair ready get an umbrella and put your towels on the chairs. Every morning when I would go get my coffee people are busy cleaning the pools getting the beach readyect. I love to see that. One thing though I would like to see more people at the end of the day picking up track that other guest do not.", "offset": [863, 969], "date": "2017-08-06", "cpt": "2", "category": "beach"}, {"id": 22, "uid": "a24d0e70-41da-4d05-8ed3-977609417ec0", "sentence": "Good but a bit disappointed. I just got back from PR and stayed 4 nights in this hotel. The stay was ok. The service was very good overall minus the housekeeping. Once I arrived there was a bit of a wait for check in but manager was very pleasant and assured me we will be taken care of soon. I suggest you have one desk for check in and one fro check out. I feel it makes things easier. We arrived early and were thankful that our room was ready because we had an early flight in and we were exhausted from driving around since 9 am. The rooms are very nice and clean. I had booked an oceanfront room but it was more of a pool view than anything. The ocean was obstructed with the palm trees. Nice view of the pool but not he ocean which is what we wanted and paid extra for. The beds were a bit too hard for us but pillows were nice. The bathroom door is terrible. Management please do something about this. The doors are sliding doors and it was so hard to close at one point my daughter pushed it too far open and it got stuck so it was a process to slide it back. For the most part I just left the door open because it was so annoying to open and close. The water pressure was perfect water temperature was nice the toiletries smelled very nice. We had an issue one day with housekeeping. We went down to have breakfast and came back from the pool beach around 130 and our room was not cleaned. We asked for new towels since they were in the hallway and told them we will be leaving in about an hour and they said ok. We left in an hour and came back roughly around 10 pm and our room was not cleaned. We were so upset because we were expecting to walk into a clean room and clean towels to shower before bed. These rooms do not have balcony so drying clothes is a headache. We would lay the clothes near the window to get some sun but this was a huge inconvenience for us. We had the hotel buffet breakfast. It was ok but definitely not worth 23 per person. For a family of 4 it was a lot of money for breakfast so if you are not a big breakfast eater save money and go somewhere else. Pool service was very nice and I loved how the servers and pool beach area cleaners were nicely uniformed. The workers will set up the chairs and umbrellas where you want them on the beach. The beach was very nice and warm. A lot of seaweed the first day but then the next time we went it was clean. Decent hotel but I am not sure if I would stay here again.", "offset": [1294, 1399], "date": "2017-08-08", "cpt": "2", "category": "beach"}, {"id": 23, "uid": "746a77a8-b992-4fcd-9339-4fa9756e93e2", "sentence": "Loved the El San Juan Hotel. My husband and I just returned from a wonderful trip to Puerto Rico. This was our fifth trip to the island. We have always stayed at the El San Juan Hotel. This hotel is incredible. We stay in the pool side villas. They are great rooms with a fantastic view of the beautiful tropical landscaping. We have always stayed in these rooms because we love the room the view but mostly because we love Mireya. She has a great personality and always has a smile on her face. She has been working at the hotel for 26 years. We met her the first time we stayed at the hotel. She has been our house keeper all five times we have stayed. We always make sure we have her floor. We now have the pleasure of calling her and her husband our friends. They are one of the many many reasons we love Puerto Rico. The employees at the El San Juan Hotel are amazing. They are so friendly and they just have a special spirit about them. The employees at this hotel are dedicated and really go out of their way to take care of the guests. The people of Puerto Rico in general are friendly and very genuine. It is that warmth and character of the people that keep us going back to this special island. We wanted to make sure we expressed our recognition of the people property accommodations and food. We introduced ourselves to many of the hotel managers. They have all worked so hard after hurricane Maria to get the hotel back up and running. What a remarkable job they have done. It really looks beautiful. We wanted the managers to hear what a positive experience we had and how much we appreciate all the employees that made our stay so enjoyable. Marangeli is the manager of the pool villa rooms. She went out of her way to introduce herself to us. She wanted to make sure we were enjoying our stay. She also took time to talk to us about the Puerto Rican culture. She was so nice and friendly not only to us but we noticed how kind she is to the employees she is in charge of. It is obvious they have a mutual respect for each other. We appreciate the fact the owners of the hotel treat their employees very well. Many had the opportunity to continue working after hurricane Maria caused major damage to the property. Many employees have worked for the hotel for 20 plus years. The hotel provides lunch every day for all employees. The owners of the El San Juan hotel are very fortunate to have the dedicated kind hearted and friendly employees. The employees are also fortunate to have considerate employers. We had the opportunity to met and talk to Landy Labadie vice president of restaurants bars and entertainment. We wanted to let him know how beautiful the property looked and how wonderful our stay had been. Landy sent a personal thank you note to our room to let us know he appreciated our sentiment. The pool and beach employees are very attentive. They check in regularly to make sure your satisfied and ask if you need anything. We stayed for 11 days so we had the opportunity to talk too many of them. They were very friendly and gave us recommendations and advise about local food and attractions. We took advantage of the incredible fitness center. It is two stories and has a roof top workout area. It has one floor of great cardio equipment one floor of weight machines kettle bells free weights and much more. The building is located near the pool and is surrounded by the beautiful tropical landscaping. My husband and I did one of the beach body boot camps taught by Luiz. Luiz made the class both fun and challenging. He is a personal trainer so he was very knowledgeable and made sure we had proper form and we were doing things correctly. We were happy to burn some calories in this beautiful fitness center because we were enjoying the wonderful food we ate for our pool side lunches. We ate the delicious guacamole with root chips from the CANA restaurant several times. The sandwiches and nachos from there were fabulous as well. The Mahi Mahi and beer can chicken tacos from the beach side restaurant were very good too. Our stay at the El San Juan Hotel could not have been better. People ask us why we always go to Puerto Rico and stay at the same place. They ask us why we do not try other places. We have visited other hotels in and around San Juan and Condado but the properties do not compare to the El San Juan. It has a beautiful breathtaking pool area wonderful beach great food very nice rooms unbelievable fitness center but most of all the people are amazing.", "offset": [3436, 3505], "date": "2019-03-05", "cpt": "2", "category": "beach"}, {"id": 24, "uid": "47f802ef-d89c-430c-ac61-65fa87389510", "sentence": "Wonderful Resort and helpful friendly staff.

After walking in to our room on the 5th all we see is a lot of white roof a pool other buildings trees and a sliver of water. Not ocean view.

The other restaurant Meat Market was outstanding the service food staff and happy hour drinks food were excellent. The Mai Tais omg. Canas Mai Tais were also delicious.

Cana Bar Staff was great especaily the young lady who made us hot tea she was very excited to do so and the presentation was lovely. The cappuccino ordered there was delicious. The outdoor Bartender Martin was corky intelligent and funny. Unfortunately the chip and dip took 30 mins to be delivered at the bar and it was not good. The Spa staff were very friendly and informative although i did not partake in yoga or activities.

The grounds at the hotel are beautiful although I did not use the pool no available chairs with umbrellas. so I went to the beach and it was wonderful.

I was told there was no plan because the hurricane had not come yet. I spent my money on water and food because the hotel said there was no plan. The next morning we recieved a call that we had 2 hours to pack up all our belongings and we were uprooted and had to move to the main building where we had to overlook the parking lot. The room was dusty and flithy I can only assume is was not clean properly because they did nt expect anyone to be in that room. Despite calling multiple times throughout the day and the next day asking when we could return to our villa we had to stay in the dust filled room that made us both sick until the night before we had to leave. We returned Thursday night we had to leave Friday morning. I lost out on money from activities I paid for but could not do due to a Hurricane that never came. I was uprooted from my room in the middle of my trip the day after the hurricane was expected even tho it never came no hotel plan and irritation from a dusty room caused a allergy flare for us both.
