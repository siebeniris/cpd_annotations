Brutal brutal experience. So I \u2019ve been dealing with this for over two weeks now and neither the hotel nor Priceline who I booked through has made things right so here we go.

That said my room was remodeled and looked pretty nice. HOWEVER. I went to get into my bed late the first night and found the stains that you will see in two attached photos. We are talking about blood feces here and honestly the sheets did n\u2019t even seem like they \u2019d been through the wash at all. Like anyone would be I was absolutely repulsed and a hotel employee came up to replace the sheets. I was assured that the manager would be in touch to make this up to me but that since I booked a prepaid rate through Priceline that they would fine another way to make this up to me. Either way the employee took photos. Suffice it to say no contact was ever made from a manager. I followed up at the front desk twice more and received the same line. I even emailed the same photos to the front desk lady at her request but still never received a response. Honestly the hallways look brutal as you can see from my pics but I was willing to let this slide. However my friend and we \u2019re woken early the next morning to loud scraping and banging sounds before someone knocked on our door at 815 AM saying he needed to come in to update the TV software. You have to be kidding me. When I went to check out and gave my room number I noticed that the employee at the front desk hurriedly took my room keys and seemed to be trying to get me out the door. She did n\u2019t even ask how the stay was. At this point we spoke up and mentioned the various issues and the fact that management has not rectified the situation as promised. The lady rudely told me that I would have to deal with Priceline since I booked through them. This was new. Priceline was n\u2019t the one who neglected to wash the sheets but I understand going through the proper channels. Now as for Priceline I \u2019ve been dealing with them for two weeks while they put all the onus on the hotel. They \u2019ve apparently been contacting the hotel about at least a partial refund. Since the hotel is unwilling to even provide some type of simple gesture to apologize for a brutal experience then Priceline tells me their hands are also tied. I \u2019d used Priceline a lot in the past without issue but please know that when an issue DOES arise Priceline does not step up to the plate. At all. I was told that booked a non refundable rate means there is no recourse. WhatI held off on writing a review until now because I wanted to see how things played out but enough is enough.

I was not sent a SALT survey to fill out even though my Hilton Honors number is on file probably to avoid a negative score. so I will do my review on here. My boyfriend and I stayed here for our 5 year anniversary on the 4th of July. Needless to say this stay was very important to us. We do not get a chance to get away often and wanted it to be perfect so we choose to stay at this hotel due to recommendations from our friends. Positives. The hotel itself is a beautiful work of art from the lobby area to the guest rooms. We were given an upgraded rm when I asked at check in which was appreciated. We ate dinner at the Brick Morter restaurant on site and the food was delicious especially the giant pretzel with beer cheese. We sat at the bar and the 2 bartenders were very friendly and provided top notch service. We also ate breakfast the next morning and the food and service was very good despite the long wait they were very busy. Michael on 3rd shift deserves a shout out as well he was very friendly and assisted us when we returned from the fireworks and needed a few things. Negatives As a front office supervisor at another downtown property in Cincinnati I expect a certain level of customer service from the Hilton brand. The check in and check out service was cold and unwelcoming. The same front desk agent checked me in and checked me out. I did not get her name but she had short brown hair and glasses older woman. When I was checked in there was literally no information given to me about the hotel. I was not told how to log into the wifi I was not told the restaurant hours I was not told any parking information. She does not even ask me how my day was going or if I had any questions. Just gave me my keys and that is about it. I guess it was the fact I am only a Silver Team member and she did not feel I was important because the 2 Diamond members that checked in after me were told plenty of this info. She did give me an upgrade when I asked I was almost afraid to ask because her demeanor was off putting. Even though I was upgraded it did not feel like an upgrade due to the TV issues I was having the whole time. The TV in the bedroom area had maybe 5 channels that were working. Majority of the channels that should be available for basic cable had the error message scrambled channel or weak signal. The small TV in the bathroom worked fine but that does not help. We waited a little bit thinking that this problem was due to the rain at the time. Later on in the night when we got back from being out it had not rained for several hours and the TV still was not working. We called the front desk and they sent engineering to look it. Engineering said that they were going to reset something but it was never fixed it or he did not even came back to check on us to see if it was working again. At check out I brought up these issues to the same lady who checked me in. I was again left with a cold response of I am sorry your receipt will be emailed to you. I was not necesarily looking to get anything but the very least she could have done was pretend to care so I did not have to waste my time typing this review.
