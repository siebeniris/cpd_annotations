Some residents on my hall had to prop their doors open to encourage ventilation. At 2 am on the first night we were there the room beside us flushed their toilet that somehow caused a loud reverberating noise to echo down our half of the hallway. Hotel staff did respond quickly to this issue. However the next night we did not get much sleep either because of the heat issue. The last morning only two out of our three guests were able to take our showers because the water to the hotel was shut off. This was not a planned or pre announced water shut off as is mentioned in other reviews. We were never notified of this issue and only found out because we mentioned it to the front desk. As we were there for a pageant competition it made getting ready incredibly difficult and actually caused the pageants schedule to be modified because of the inconvenience. I would suggest the hotel implement an emergency phone alert system in cases of emergency water shut off.
